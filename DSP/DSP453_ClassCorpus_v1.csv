101,HBW_Doc1_HolmesAndWatson,"""Holmes and Watson review: a lumbering Sherlockian knockdown. Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly ape Conan Doyleï¿½s Victorian detective in an improbably dreadful comedic misfire. Ever since the days of Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, there has been a vein of character comedy in screen portrayals of Conan Doyleï¿½s great sleuth. As the figure of audience identification, Dr Watson registers both admiration for Sherlock Holmesï¿½s extraordinary powers of deduction and intermittent exasperation at his arrogance and hauteur. Itï¿½s easy to see the potential for pointed exaggeration, as in Gene Wilderï¿½s 1975 The Adventures of Sherlock Holmesï¿½ Smarter Brother or Thom Eberhardtï¿½s 1988 Without a Clue, where the humour springs from the legendary Holmes being not quite as sharp as weï¿½ve been led to believe. Enter the established comedy duo of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, as Holmes and Watson respectively, and the conceit this time seems to be that the actorsï¿½ goofball rudery and physical knockabout ï¿½ seen in previous pairings Talladega Nights (2006) and Step Brothers (2008) ï¿½ will generate gales of laughter when shoehorned into the seemingly inappropriate context of a Conan Doyle-style detective saga. Unfortunately, howls of anguish are the result, since poor material, ill-timed performances and an all-encompassing air of desperate cluelessness create a mirth-free zone. Part of the problem is that writer-director Etan Cohen (not Ethan Coen, an important distinction) doesnï¿½t quite know what to do with Ferrellï¿½s facility for playing pompous fools.Here then are gags where the great detectiveï¿½s elaborate deductions cause only chaos, notably in a tiresomely extended set piece involving the pursuit of an escaped disease-carrying mosquito; yet there are also key plot points where Holmesï¿½s convention-defying conclusions (that the Moriarty brought to trial is an impostor, for instance), while unlikely, prove absolutely correct. There is no consistency in the telling, making it unclear how seriously we should take anything. A dismal sense of ï¿½so what?ï¿½ sets in early, and certainly isnï¿½t helped by direction that struggles to shape the proceedings with any sense of urgency or tension. It all stands or falls, therefore, on the gags themselves, and thereï¿½s very little here that hits the mark. Various bits of business show the central duo ï¿½inventingï¿½ the selfie (with an ungainly box camera) and drunk texting (via telegram, which Holmes dubs the ï¿½intoxigraphï¿½), while elsewhere the film looks to poke fun at changes in social attitudes, underlining Holmesï¿½s liberal use of cocaine and his inability to conceive that a woman can actually be a qualified doctor. The comic intentions are obvious but barely warrant a smile, which makes for a long 90 minutes, with the occasional puerile pratfalls and sheer waste of Ralph Fiennes, Rebecca Hall and Kelly Macdonald only intensifying the gloom. Glaring anachronisms, such as a gramophone playing The Righteous Brothersï¿½ Unchained Melody in a senseless Ghost-themed skit, or the launch of the Titanic a good 30 years too early (cue a truly pitiful Billy Zane cameo as ï¿½himselfï¿½), indicate a film scrabbling around for something, anything, to raise a chuckle. Alas, without success. With apologies to Jordan Peele, ï¿½the sunken placeï¿½ has found its cinematic form. """,HBW_Doc1_HolmesAndWatson,HBW,Comedy,Negative,Holmes and Watson
102,HBW_Doc2_HolmesAndWatson,"""ï¿½Holmes & Watsonï¿½ Review: No, Sh-t Sherlock. This Will Ferrell/John C. Reilly parody of Sherlock Holmes is so painfully unfunny we're not sure it can legally be called a comedy. REMEMBER THAT SCENE in Step Brothers, when a sleepwalking Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly end up wrecking their parentsï¿½ kitchen? My god, that was hilarious. What about that part in Talladega Nights, when Ferrellï¿½s NASCAR champion and his best friend/sidekick say grace at the dinner table (ï¿½Dear Tiny Jesus, your golden fleece diapers and tiny little balled-up fists ï¿½ï¿½)? So riotous. Or how about any random scene from, say, Anchorman or Walk Hard? You canï¿½t go wrong with the formerï¿½s ï¿½Afternoon Delightï¿½ sing-along, or anything in the latter involving drugs or Dewey Coxï¿½s Dylan phase. Weï¿½re crying just thinking about them. Itï¿½s easier, not to mention far less agonizing, to go back and just reminisce about those Ferrell/Reilly greatest-hits moments than to try and reckon with Holmes & Watson. Itï¿½s so painfully unfunny weï¿½re not sure it can legally be called a comedy. Letï¿½s put it another way: You know that story about the monkey paw, where a grieving mother wishes for something and her wish comes true, only itï¿½s all twisted and wrong and horrible? Someone may have gotten a hold of one of those talismans and said, ï¿½Iï¿½d love a Step Brothers reunion, maybe with a recognizable I.P.ï¿½ and then a rotting, shambling corpse is suddenly knocking on the multiplex doors. The idea of giving Arthur Conan Doyleï¿½s famous characters to a great screen duo surely seemed like a genius idea. Youï¿½d almost have to willfully want to squander the notion to screw it up this badly. Youï¿½d also have to be ignorant of the fact that, even if with A-list comic talent capable of turning this into more than just the sum of its wink-nudge Sherlock-foolery, you have to give them something more than a rough sketch to work with. That, dear friends, is elementa ï¿½ sorry, weï¿½re too depressed by this whole thing to even finish the joke. Perhaps itï¿½s best to use deductive logic to figure out what exactly happened here. Observe, the high concept/low return ratio, suggesting someone merely scribbled down an elevator pitch at the last second before a meeting ï¿½ ï¿½Um, Ferrell and Reilly as, ah, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watsonï¿½ ï¿½ then were surprised to suddenly get a greenlight. Look closely at the recognizable traits of Ferrellï¿½s master detective and Reillyï¿½s beta-male sidekick, all of which are slightly exaggerated for effect and retro-fitted for the starsï¿½ personae yet never really utilized beyond reiterating: Yup, heï¿½s smart but also arrogant and stupid, and the other guyï¿½s his buddy! The desperate, extreme mugging of both actors ï¿½ truly, a telltale sign that even they realized that the story, involving the escape of Holmesï¿½ archenemy Moriarty (really, Ralph Fiennes? Really?) and a plot to kill the Queen, wasnï¿½t much to hang gags upon, so theyï¿½d better make faces ASAP. Notice, amateur sleuths, the anachronistic touches ï¿½ Selfies! Pay-Per-View! MAGA hats! ï¿½ and in-case-of-emergency-hit-someone-in-head crappy slapstick in lieu of an almost complete absence of actual jokes. Behold how a sequence involving Watson and Rebecca Hallï¿½s female medical practitioner is take-off on a scene from Ghost, a movie thatï¿½s almost 30 years old, yet thereï¿½s a generic hip-hop-lite soundtrack in a ï¿½how do you do, fellow kids?ï¿½ attempt to be hip. (Thereï¿½s also a character who pretends to be a cat, because why not?) Peruse the IMDb page of one Etan Cohen, a gent with an impressive screenwriting resumï¿½ (he had a hand in the scripts for Idiocracy and Tropic Thunder), yet is the director responsible for the wretched Ferrell/Kevin Hart 2015 project Get Hard. Kindly note how what should have been no-brainer wins, like an Alan Menken-penned musical number and several parodies of slo-mo scenes ï¿½ la the Robert Downey Jr. Sherlock movies, are virtually smothered in the crib. And as we close the case file on this crime, perhaps itï¿½s worth jotting down in the dossier that while itï¿½s not unusual for studios to not screen movies for critics and whatnot ahead of time, the combination of a somewhat muted marketing campaign and slipping it into theaters on Christmas sans much promotion suggests that even the distributors knew they had a cut-bait situation on their hands. Also: You can only swindle audiences by thinking you simply throw A-list stars in anything and people will still show up, drooling like Pavlovï¿½s pups, for so long before the echo in empty theaters is deafening. At one point in Holmes & Watson, a character goes undercover as a manure salesman and begins screaming, ï¿½Horseshit for sale! Will anyone buy my horseï¿½s shit?ï¿½ Itï¿½s the one genuinely honest, self-aware moment in the movie.""",HBW_Doc2_HolmesAndWatson,HBW,Comedy,Negative,Holmes and Watson
103,HBW_Doc3_HolmesAndWatson,"""It is often said that Sherlock Holmes, the legendary detective created by Arthur Conan Doyle, has made the most on-screen appearances in the history of cinema by a human fictional character (though he still runs second in total appearances to Dracula). I am not going to flat-out say that ï¿½Holmes & Watson,ï¿½ the latest big screen vehicle for the character that finds him being played by Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly as his aide, Dr. John Watson, is so bad that it could bring his seemingly endless streak of movie appearances to a definitive halt. But if any film could possess that power, this is the one. """"Holmes & Watson"""" is so excruciatingly awful that you have to wonder what it was, other than their paychecks, that could have possessed the cast and crew to keep coming back each day, when it must have been obvious from the first day of shooting that the project was the most hopeless of cases imaginable. As you may have surmised from the presence of Ferrell and Reilly in the cast, the film is a comedic (at least technically) look at Holmes and his extraordinary deductive skills, an approach that filmmakers have been utilizing for almost as long as they have been bringing the character to the big screen. Some of these films have been quite goodï¿½Billy Wilderï¿½s flawed but ambitious ï¿½The Private Life of Sherlock Holmesï¿½ and the brilliant but shamefully little-seen cult classic ï¿½Zero Effectï¿½ï¿½and some of them, such as Gene Wilderï¿½s ï¿½The Adventures of Sherlock Holmesï¿½ Smarter Brotherï¿½ and the Michael Caine romp ï¿½Without a Clue,ï¿½ have been quite dreadful. In all of those cases, good or bad, the filmmakers each had some kind of discernible comedic notion they were trying to put forth. With this film, it seems as if once Ferrell and Reilly were cast, all the other creative work was brought to a halt on the assumption that the co-stars of ï¿½Talladega Nights: The Legend of Ricky Bobbyï¿½ and ï¿½Step Brothersï¿½ would bring enough comedic juice to the proceedings to keep it moving. Based on the available evidence here, all that they actually managed to bring between them was several gallons of flop sweat. It is telling, for example, that the funniest bit in the film comes right at the start and does not involve either of its two ostensible stars. In it, we see the young Sherlock Holmes being mercilessly teased by his classmates at boarding school and using his keen intellect to figure out the bad things that they have done and get them expelledï¿½before long, he is the only student left for his teachers to focus on and his intelligence grows exponentially as a result. This scene works because it is obvious that writer/director Etan Cohen had an idea for a comedic bitï¿½what would the worldï¿½s greatest mind do in childhood when faced with bullies?ï¿½and pursues it to a decent punchline. At that point in the film, some viewers may be deluded into thinking that """"Holmes & Watson"""" might have promise after all, only to have those hopes shattered a few moments later when the stars arrive and it all goes to hell. This version of Holmes, having recently proven in court that arch-villain Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes) was not guilty of the crime that he was accused of committing, is hired by Buckingham Palace to uncover a plot to kill Queen Victoria (Pam Ferris) in four days time by someone who may or may not be the fiend. The biggest problem here isnï¿½t that this plot is idiotic at best and virtually non-existent the rest of the time. It isnï¿½t the fact that the jokes on display run the gamut from deeply unfunny toilet humor (including a long and wheezy bit where the guys try to come up with euphemisms for masturbation in a courtroom) to equally dopey anachronisms such as Watsonï¿½s attempt to use an old-time camera to take a selfie with the Queen. It isnï¿½t even the sense throughout that what we are watching is little more than a series of improv attempts that started off badly and never gained steam. No, the biggest problem is that the film cannot make up its mind as to whether Holmes is a genius of stunning proportions who happens to be a goof, or a vain and pompous idiot whose reputation as a crime-solving mastermind is largely thanks to the behind-the-scenes efforts of Watson. Most comedic Holmes films choose one of the two approaches and go from there, but ï¿½Holmes & Watsonï¿½ switches between them in virtually every scene. This haphazard approach may have worked if the jokes were funny, but the whole thing feels like someone took the unfunny outtakes that might have adorned the end credits and stretched them out into their own film. Considering that the end result is probably the biggest cinematic clunker of the season, the closest thing to an actual mystery in ï¿½Holmes & Watsonï¿½ is how a screenplay as puerile as this one could attract so many talented people. Besides Ferrell, Reilly and Fiennes, the film also includes the usually reliable Rebecca Hall and Kelly Macdonald in the most insultingly conceived roles of their careers, Hugh Laurie in a flop bit as Holmesï¿½ brother, and even Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon, co-stars of the hilarious ï¿½The Tripï¿½ films, as, respectively, a one-armed tattooist and Inspector Lestradeï¿½like the stars, they all embarrass themselves mightily throughout. I guess there is a possible bright side to all of this: maybe Coogan and Brydon carpooled together and decided to film themselves on their daily journeys to produce this ultimately failed enterprise. If such a film existed, there is a decent chance that it could actually inspire the big laughs that ï¿½Holmes & Watsonï¿½ is so clearly clueless about.""",HBW_Doc3_HolmesAndWatson,HBW,Comedy,Negative,Holmes and Watson
104,HBW_Doc4_HolmesAndWatson,"""Holmes & Watson wasnï¿½t shown at all to the press in advance of its release. At one London cinema, its very first public screening on Boxing Day morning was abandoned on the grounds that the projector wasnï¿½t working properly. You can tell just why the cinema manager there didnï¿½t do more to get it shown. This turns out to be a Christmas turkey of a movie ï¿½ a comedy detective mystery that will dismay Sherlock Holmes lovers and frustrate fans of its stars, Will Ferrell and John C Reilly. Ferrell plays Holmes. Itï¿½s hard to believe the actor so funny in Anchorman and so often touched with comic genius is so leaden here. Reilly is wonderful as Oliver Hardy in new drama Stan & Ollie but, like Ferrell, struggles here with a screenplay that gives him so little to work with. Other prominent members of the cast ï¿½ Ralph Fiennes as villain Moriarty, Kelly Macdonald as a slatternly and very promiscuous Mrs Hudson, Steve Coogan as a one-armed tattoo artist, Hugh Laurie as Sherlockï¿½s smarter brother Mycroft ï¿½ donï¿½t fare any better. The film starts in early 1880s London with a despondent Dr Watson recently returned from the Afghan war. Holmes isnï¿½t just the worldï¿½s greatest detective. He also grows giant vegetables and is very angry at Watson landing headfirst on top of his prized marrow. Nonetheless, Watson moves into the detectiveï¿½s Baker Street apartment and becomes his devoted friend and amanuensis. Ferrellï¿½s Holmes speaks in an effete English accent. He likes a morning sniff of cocaine to get his brain ticking. Early on, the film has its droll moments. We see Holmes trying to kill a deadly mosquito with a cricket bat and inadvertently unleashing a swarm of killer bees in the process. Mrs Hudson is almost caught in flagrante with Mark Twain. Thereï¿½s a courtroom scene involving masturbation. (Explaining onanism to the judge, Holmes and Watson tell the baffled judge that the suspect ï¿½pours his own teaï¿½.) Rob Brydon looks suitably exasperated as Inspector Lestrade, continually being belittled by Holmes. Rebecca Hall turns up as Grace Hart, a mysterious and glamorous American doctor whose expertise confounds both Holmes and Watson. (They canï¿½t believe that a woman is capable of holding down such a job.) Writer-director Etan Cohen throws in every last clichï¿½ about Victorian London that he can summon up. We get street kids with dirty faces who look as if theyï¿½ve escaped from Oliver Twist. There are scenes of beer drinking in East End pubs, of darkened alleyways and ruffian-filled streets which invoke memories of Jack the Ripper. Queen Victoria (a stony faced Pam Ferris) is shown looking very unamused when Dr Watson gets too touchy feely with her. Cohen also includes plenty of anachronisms. Rap music plays over the credits. A key scene plays on the Titanic (even though the ocean liner didnï¿½t make its one and only voyage until 1912). Gags about selfies and even veiled references to Donald Trump are part of the mix. The storytelling style is episodic in the extreme. The film consists of a series of comic sketches, loosely strung together. Several of these involve Holmesï¿½s headgear. (He hasnï¿½t yet alighted on the deerstalker and seems to think that a fez or cowboy hat might serve him just as well.) A plot is afoot to murder the Queen. Holmes needs to work out whether Moriarty (thought to have buzzed off to America) is behind it. Holmes and Watson play chess together without a board. They also play ï¿½rock, paper, scissorsï¿½. (Holmes can always see several moves ahead of his partner ï¿½ one reason why Watson is never granted co-detective status.) The two get drunk together and Watson sends a very salacious ï¿½intoxigramï¿½ to Dr Hart. Holmes, meanwhile, becomes smitten by Dr Hartï¿½s onion eating companion, Millicent (Lauren Lapkus), who was raised by feral wolves. He is shown vomiting in the morgue and urinating down his trouser leg (not something we can ever imagine happening with Basil Rathbone or Benedict Cumberbatch). The film reaches its absolute nadir in a Les Misï¿½rables-style musical scene in which the characters give vent to their emotions in a song. Occasionally, the humour is well observed. Dr Hart has a nice line about the superiority of the American justice system over its British equivalent. No citizen (she points out to Holmes) can be found guilty without first being tried by a ï¿½jury of white, property owning menï¿½. Ferrell wears that familiar look of beatific and deadpan innocence. His comic timing is still impeccable but that alone canï¿½t come close to salvaging a film that has been put together in such an elementary way.""",HBW_Doc4_HolmesAndWatson,HBW,Comedy,Negative,Holmes and Watson
105,HBW_Doc5_HolmesAndWatson,"""ï¿½Holmes & Watsonï¿½ Review: Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly Fail to Solve an Unfunny Script. Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly reunite for a spoof that offers fewer laughs in its entirety than ï¿½Step Brothersï¿½ does in its deleted scenes. Ten years after ï¿½Step Brothersï¿½ was gifted unto humanity ï¿½ and at least five since the world rightfully came to recognize that film as the Dadaist masterpiece that it is ï¿½ Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly have re-teamed for a comedy thatï¿½s somehow even dumber than the one that first galvanized their incredible chemistry. That should have been a good thing. It isnï¿½t. The trouble with ï¿½Holmes & Watson,ï¿½ a witless Sherlock Holmes spoof that supplies fewer laughs in its entirety than ï¿½Step Brothersï¿½ does in its deleted scenes, is that the movie can never decide how dumb it wants to be. Or, more accurately, what kind of dumb it wants to be. Re-imagining fictionï¿½s greatest detective as the kind of world-class egoist that Ferrell could play in his sleep (heï¿½s basically Ron Burgundy with a magnifying glass), this new spin on the public domainï¿½s most popular character twists the legendary sleuth into a man who uses his forensic brilliance as a mask for his emotional ineptitude. While Sherlock can sniff out a killer from the faintest trace of vinegar on the lapel of their shirt, heï¿½s clueless when it comes to human behavior; it only takes him a few minutes to catch the nefarious Professor Moriarty (an inexplicably under-used Ralph Fiennes, whose brief performance could have been cobbled together with footage from the many other movies in which heï¿½s played a dastardly 19th century British man), but he might go the rest of his life without understanding how Dr. John Watson (Reilly) feels about playing second fiddle to his famous boss and best friend. When Holmes deduces that the man he captured is a decoy, and that the real Moriarty is still on the loose, heï¿½s forced to reconcile his intellect with his idiocy if he hopes to stop his arch-nemesis from killing the Queen of England. Written and directed by Etan Cohen, whose script for ï¿½Idiocracyï¿½ suggested a more acute understanding of how stupidity can be curdled into genius, ï¿½Holmes & Watsonï¿½ shares its heroï¿½s inability to be high-concept and low-brow at the same time. While the opening gag ï¿½ a throwaway reference to ï¿½Hannah Montanaï¿½ that feels like it was put on the screen about five drafts too soon ï¿½ anticipates the kind of wanton silliness that audiences havenï¿½t since the golden days of ZAZ, the movie seems afraid to embrace it. The more ridiculous the joke, the faster Cohen tends to cut away from it; he doesnï¿½t have a problem including a ï¿½Ghostï¿½ parody where Watson swoons for an American doctor (Rebecca Hall) while they lick vanilla frosting off of a fresh cadaver, but the scene is over before it even really begins. Maybe Cohen lacks the demented vision to understand what Reilly and Hall could do with that material, or maybe the studio got skittish and tried to force the film back to its central mystery at all costs (a central mystery so irrelevant that itï¿½s eventually solved off-screen). Whatever the reason, ï¿½Holmes and Watsonï¿½ constantly feels like itï¿½s leaving an all-you-can-eat buffet on a full stomach. Instead of picking a particular tone and wringing it for all itï¿½s worth, Cohen just throws a mess of half-funny jokes at the wall in the hopes that some of them might stick. They donï¿½t. Not enough of them, anyway. Mild gross-out humor (projectile vomit, cadavers baked into party cakes, etc.) is mashed together with poorly choreographed physical comedy (Holmes and Watson accidentally unleash a swarm of killer bees while trying to kill a single mosquito) and limp post-modern gags that poke fun at old technology (Watson telegrams someone a dick pic) or current events (a ï¿½Make England Great Againï¿½ hat precedes a conversation about how the Electoral College will always protect America from tyrannical grifters). Some of this wacky business is amusing, but most of it distracts from Ferrell and Reillyï¿½s extraordinary talent for character-driven comedy. In a movie that feels more disjointed than an episode of ï¿½Saturday Night Live,ï¿½ all of best moments consistently return to the basic conceit of Holmes being an arrogant blowhard, and Watson trying to balance a sense of duty with a lack of self-worth. While Ferrellï¿½s performance is a bit too familiar to land, Reilly is often hilarious as Holmesï¿½ hype-man and unwitting guinea pig (an early courthouse scene, in which Watson obliviously murders a handful of innocent bystanders, hints at the no-holds-barred comedy this could have been). Both of the title characters are provided with love interests, and the film is far more interested in them than it is in apprehending Moriarty. Hall, usually found in more serious fare, is delightful as a doctor with a penchant for electroshock therapy, while the great Lauren Lapkus manages to steal a few scenes (and Sherlockï¿½s heart) as a woman who was raised by feral cats; a better movie would have done more with the worldï¿½s smartest man falling for someone who bites lollipops and hisses at strangers. The cast is rounded out by an incredible array of actors and comedians, including Kelly Macdonald as Holmesï¿½ secretary, Hugh Laurie as Holmesï¿½ brother, Steve Coogan as a one-armed tattoo artist, Rob Brydon as a flabbergasted inspector, and someone who shows up for a last-minute cameo so good that it almost redeems the rest of the movie. Of course, none of these people are given anything to do ï¿½ forget standing out, Laurie isnï¿½t even on-screen long enough to stand up. Usually, youï¿½d have to watch the Golden Globes to see this much wasted talent. As it stands, the only compelling mystery about ï¿½Holmes & Watsonï¿½ is how so many funny people have been squeezed into such an unfunny movie, a movie that isnï¿½t nearly smart enough to recognize how stupid it should have been.""",HBW_Doc5_HolmesAndWatson,HBW,Comedy,Negative,Holmes and Watson
106,HBW_Doc6_HolmesAndWatson,"""Despite evidence to the contrary, Holmes and Watson isnï¿½t as bad as you might suspect. Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly wring some joy out of the most elementary of material. Maybe itï¿½s just the holiday spirit, but I canï¿½t find it in myself to be particularly frustrated by Holmes and Watson. Admittedly, itï¿½s no Step Brothers, and I canï¿½t help wishing for a more bizarre cut of the film (thereï¿½s an undercurrent of weirdness to the whole affair that feels somehow tempered), but if it feels a little elementary compared to the best of Will Ferrell and John C. Reillyï¿½s work (the aforementioned Step Brothers, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, etc.), thatï¿½s not necessarily a damning distinction. That Ferrell and Reilly should take on Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, respectively, feels like a logical next step for the comedy duo, as theyï¿½ve made something of a speciality out of two-handers featuring Ferrell as the bright star and Reilly as the yearning sidekick. Granted, their particular spin on Arthur Conan Doyleï¿½s most famous creations paints his legendarily brilliant pair as emotionally stunted morons, but the point still stands: Thereï¿½s an archetype that the story fulfills thatï¿½s a perfect match. What makes the film more than a retread, however, is also what makes it so unwieldy. As the detective and doctor work toward foiling an assassination attempt on the Queen (Pam Ferris) by none other than Professor Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes), the situations they find themselves in become increasingly bizarre. Part of it is to do with the fact that cracking the case is secondary to cracking open their hearts, and part of it is a seeming indecision as to exactly what Holmes and Watson is meant to be. Itï¿½s not quite the absurdist art that Step Brothers is, nor entirely the political commentary of Talladega Nights (a sharper look at the Bush years than this yearï¿½s Vice, with all due apologies to Adam McKay); instead, it falls halfway in between, failing to make a completely coherent meal out of either approach. That said, if I had to wager (with the full acknowledgment that such speculation is meaningless), I would say that director Etan Cohen was trying for something more in line with the former, as there are bizarre interludes scattered throughout that suggest a much stranger film. The best word to describe those moments is ï¿½grotesque,ï¿½ as the filmï¿½s sense of humor goes beyond the usual scatological jokes ï¿½ plus the requisite period comedy jabs at modern culture and technological advancements, and some laughs at the expense of previous iterations of Holmes and Watson ï¿½ and ventures into genuinely strange territory. One scene, doubling down on Watsonï¿½s status as a sidekick rather than an equal, introduces something called the ï¿½companionsï¿½ room.ï¿½ The roster of characters introduced there is so strange that their split-second appearance, a far cry from the triter set pieces that populate the rest of the film, is deeply jarring. Another gag spins fun out of the effects of poison, while the filmï¿½s opening sequence alone involves not only turtle rehabilitation but the coining of the term ï¿½un-crying.ï¿½ Itï¿½s that weirdness that makes the filmï¿½s big emotional payoff ï¿½ which, amazingly, comes courtesy of Alan Menken and Glenn Slater ï¿½ so fun when it finally kicks in. (The sequence is also shot more inventively than most of the rest of the film, though thatï¿½s neither here nor there.) But it doesnï¿½t last long enough, or rather, it comes a little too early in the film out of necessity, as thereï¿½s still a Moriarty mystery to be solved. And yes, Fiennes is largely wasted as Moriarty, but what he does get to do is so patently strange that itï¿½s hard to put out of mind. The same goes for Kelly Macdonald as Mrs. Hudson, absolutely swimming in the river of ham, to the point that you almost forget to wonder what sheï¿½s doing in such a thankless role; Hugh Laurie as Mycroft Holmes, hinting at the glory of his Blackadder days; Rob Brydon as Lestrade, the requisite straight man who seems to have teleported in from another, better movie; and Steve Coogan as a one-armed tattoo artist, who very nearly steals the whole show with an elastic, easy-breezy performance that, naturally, is cut short a little too soon. Rebecca Hall and Lauren Lapkus fare a little better in terms of screen time as Holmes and Watsonï¿½s respective love interests, though, ultimately, thereï¿½s not enough space in the movie for anybody but the leading men. If, at times, it all feels like an overextended comedic bit, thatï¿½s because it is. Holmes and Watson is mostly an excuse for Ferrell and Reilly to fool around with British accents (which transcend being good or bad for how hard they lean into how ridiculous they know they sound ï¿½ they still somehow sound better than a certain lamplighter) and point out how wild the past was (the film has multiple references to casual cocaine use). It doesnï¿½t really matter that the case is impossible to solve independently, because itï¿½s not the point of the story, and the filmï¿½s relatively thin construction isnï¿½t so severe a crime when the actors can carry most of it off fairly well. Reilly in particular brings a bona fide quality to an otherwise gormless Watson, digging into the sensitivity that served him so well in The Sisters Brothers to what are admittedly diminishing returns. But it still keeps Holmes and Watson from being completely disposable, and the same goes for the whole of the film: Though it doesnï¿½t all quite hold together, there are enough inspired moments ï¿½ and enough strangeness lying just below the filmï¿½s surface ï¿½ that it doesnï¿½t completely fall apart, either.""",HBW_Doc6_HolmesAndWatson,HBW,Comedy,Positive,Holmes and Watson
107,HBW_Doc7_HolmesAndWatson,"""The comedy so execrable that audiences evacuated before it ended. The abomination so unholy that Netflix allegedly doused holy water on it in rejection. The massive miscalculation that, at least for a time, registered a giant goose egg on Rotten Tomatoes. Bound for box-office ignominy and an inevitable rout of its 2018 Razzie contenders, Holmes & Watson is the fourth* collaboration between Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, playing the title characters in that order. And it would certainly seem to be an unmitigated disaster. If only the results were so elementary. Sure, Holmes & Watson mines familiar ground, opening on yet another purposefully misattributed quote a la Ferrell and Reillyï¿½s main works, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby and Step Brothers. Itï¿½s also a bountiful orchard of low-hanging fruit by way of anachronistic jokes that pad the movie to a commercially acceptable feature-length. Some are amusing, such as the continued presumption of cocaine, heroin and opiates as a pinnacle of medical treatment or an ï¿½intoxigramï¿½ as the drunk-text antecedent. Some are anemic, like the ï¿½platypus-faced self-photographï¿½ preceding the duck-lips selfie. But the film is a far sight funnier than writer-director Etan Cohenï¿½s first outing with Ferrell (the witless prison comedy Get Hard). And even as Holmes & Watson never rises to Brothersï¿½ sublimely absurd skewering of male maturity, itï¿½s a brainier blunderbuss of buffoonish satire than Talladega. (Quite tough to hoist a convincingly rigid middle finger at NASCAR culture when your other handï¿½s fist-bumping the top brass to gain organizational support.) Holmes & Watson presupposes that Sir Arthur Conan Doyleï¿½s standard-bearers for seamless logic are instead both utter dimwits dining out on long-faded success. Exuding even more fey-dandy energy than he did as Mugatu, Ferrell envisions Sherlock Holmes as an impudent man-baby as reliant on drugs to keep going as he is the codependency of his relationship with Dr. John Watson. Reilly indulges in spikier slapstick than usual to make Watson a trigger-happy dunce whose mantle of authority seems honorary at best. We first meet Sherlock in his school days, bullied by his peers into kissing a donkeyï¿½s ass. After learning to ï¿½uncryï¿½ and lock away his emotions, Sherlock gets the entirety of his school expelled (leaving the teachers to focus solely on his intellect) and takes as his only friend a young John. Itï¿½s no accident that the opening credits breeze through the pairï¿½s salad days of criminal investigation. Holmes & Watson wants us to consider them as morons obsessed with public adulation and elevated perception of past glories that are, in all likelihood, more exaggerated than weï¿½ve been led to believe. Sound like anyone weï¿½ve heard from a lot for the last few years? Sure, Cohen goes mallet-on-the-head about it with a couple of obvious verbal / sight gags, but itï¿½s a winking dig at the continued selfish supremacy of the male ego. These are men who have utterly lost what little step they might have had in the first place and are, at least initially, incapable of admitting as much. (Indeed, the only people we really see Holmes get the drop on are the schoolmates he rats out in the prologue.) Their bizarre moralism (note Reillyï¿½s comment about ï¿½the wages of wankingï¿½ to Ralph Fiennes, taking the gig for a big check and perhaps this scene alone) and insistence on the most brutish solutions possible is as much of a howling cry about where we are now as a spoof-comedy can be. Indeed, itï¿½s a better story of the perils in propping up those who purport to excel in their field than Vice (producer Adam McKayï¿½s ostensibly more ï¿½respectableï¿½ film to open on Christmas). Every five minutes, youï¿½ll lose the filmï¿½s assassinate-the-Queen plot, such as it is and perhaps only peripherally involving Holmesï¿½ nemesis, Moriarty (Fiennes). Thatï¿½s part of the point, as Holmes and Watson lose it, too. Thereï¿½s even a joke about that in one of many laugh-aloud moments to take the piss out of both romanticized notions of 19th-century London and the Sherlock-vision popularized by the Robert Downey Jr. and Benedict Cumberbatch incarnations. It also wouldnï¿½t be a Ferrell-Reilly jam without a buffet of non-sequitur delights on which to chomp like the raw onions Holmes insists will keep him healthy. Thereï¿½s Reilly and Rebecca Hall (as a visiting doctor from America) flirting by rubbing frosting across a cake-covered corpse theyï¿½re about to cut open for autopsy Thereï¿½s a musical number with more confident visual flair than anything in Mary Poppins Returns outside the animated sequence. (Co-written by Alan Menken, the song is also a doozy.) And then thereï¿½s ï¿½ well, everything Lauren Lapkus is doing in the background of any scene, from gnawing on a giant lollipop to making feral eyes at Ferrell. Smart about how itï¿½s stupid, Holmes & Watson suggests an embrace of remorseless logic will only rot your soul and friendships. And itï¿½s a shrewd use of fictionï¿½s most prominent purveyors of said logic to deconstruct the ways in which itï¿½s ill-advised. Yeah, itï¿½s a movie in which John C. Reilly lactates, but it says more than youï¿½d expect about the milk of human kindness.""",HBW_Doc7_HolmesAndWatson,HBW,Comedy,Positive,Holmes and Watson
108,HBW_Doc8_HolmesAndWatson,"""Will Ferrell and John C Reilly team up yet again (Step Brothers, Talladega Nights; Anchorman 2) for another serving of lunkhead, fall-about comedy, with Ferrell playing classic detective Sherlock Holmes and Reilly as his assistant Dr Watson. Itï¿½s not as funny as their previous outings but the flick has enough slapstick, vomiting, poo, comic violence and general flailing about to keep fans mildly entertained. As loose as the plotting often is ï¿½ one bit involving the lads and the Queen alone in their office literally makes no story sense, but is funny as heck ï¿½ writer/director Etan Cohen (Get Hard) actually serves up a pretty good twist to all the shenanigans and shagging. As with Adam Sandler, it remains amazing the quality people comedians such as Ferrell are able to lure into their low-brow comic worlds. Here weï¿½ve got the sight of Kelly McDonald (Trainspotting; No Country for Old Men) as a sex-crazed tart and Rebecca Hall (Frost/Nixon; Vicky Cristina Barcelona; The Town) putting in a good, straight-faced performance opposite all the goofballing. Fun Facts: Watch the end credit and youï¿½ll see that the film actually got the blessing of the estate of Holmes creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Check Rotten Tomatoes and youï¿½ll also see how the film has been almost universally despised by critics the world over. Just goes to show how subjective comedy is, especially with comics such as Ferrell. For humour like his, it helps a lot if youï¿½re in a particularly relaxed mood. Ferrell off leash in hilarious skewering of Sherlock nerd fantasy. Many distinguished actors have played Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson, but few have done so with quite the unhinged abandon of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly ï¿½ reunited here a decade after the unforgettable Step Brothers, where they starred as grown men still living with their parents and squabbling like little kids. Holmes and Watson is essentially a continuation of the same project, in the form of a parody that has less to do with the writings of Arthur Conan Doyle than it does with the spectacle of man-children playing dress-ups. Etan Cohen (Get Hard?) is the credited writer-director, but we're given the impression ï¿½ accurate or not ï¿½ that the leads are pretty much inventing their lines as they go along. As the world's greatest detective, Ferrell purses his lips, flutters his hands, and speaks in a strangled approximation of a refined English accent. As his loyal sidekick, Reilly stands by, nodding sagely and occasionally breaking out into a girlish giggle. Both spend a lot of time screaming at the tops of their lungs, recklessly brandishing dangerous weapons and congratulating each other on their superiority to everyone else ï¿½ in a manner only possible for a couple of all-American yahoos pretending to be upper-crust 19th-century Brits. In theory this dynamic duo is dashing around jolly old London in pursuit of nemesis Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes), who has apparently returned from beyond the grave to sabotage Holmes' birthday party and threaten the life of Queen Victoria (Pam Ferris). The plot is so rickety it could fall apart at any moment ... which of course is partly the point in a film that aims for the pure, old-fashioned silliness of The Goon Show or early Steve Martin. Holmes and Watson is not for everybody, but if you want to see Ferrell off the leash this is the best opportunity in a long time. The joy of a relentlessly juvenile approach is that it succeeds in making every previous version of the material look just as ridiculous: Guy Ritchie's macho vehicles for Robert Downey Jr come in for special ribbing, but Cohen and his stars have surely taken a look at the BBC's maudlin Sherlock as well. There are broader satirical implications, too, even setting aside the handful of obligatory Trump jokes. With his brash eccentricities, his disdain for women and his """"superhuman"""" intellect, Holmes can be viewed as a template for countless pulp heroes who have flourished since ï¿½ all of them basically fantasy alter-egos for nerdy teenage boys. Ferrell, who has made a career out of mocking male insecurities, clearly understands this well. It's not for nothing that one of the early comic routines here has him and Reilly reeling off a list of increasingly elaborate synonyms for """"wanking"""".""",HBW_Doc8_HolmesAndWatson,HBW,Comedy,Positive,Holmes and Watson
109,HBW_Doc9_HolmesAndWatson,"""Holmes & Watson Doesnï¿½t Make It Easy, But Thereï¿½s Fun to Be Had. One of the yearï¿½s most critically shellacked movies (the pros were forced to watch it in theaters on Christmas Day alongside the common hordes), Holmes & Watson begins as ineptly as any comedy Iï¿½ve seen, and then settles into an agreeably silly groove that had the common hordes around me yukking it up. When itï¿½s bad it is, indeed, painful, but even third-rate Will Ferrell + John C. Reilly is more inspired than the noisy contraptions on either side of it in the multiplex. The twist is to make Sherlock Holmes, Arthur Conan Doyleï¿½s pillar of 19th-century rationalism, into the latest of Ferrellï¿½s posturing child-men, another symbol of the patriarchyï¿½s dimming light. After being tricked by grade-school classmates into kissing the arse of an ass when he thought heï¿½d be kissing a girl, Holmes purges himself of emotion and becomes a giant brain doling out punishments to those who would underestimate his powers of ratiocination. Those powers in Holmes & Watson are rather elastic. Where the trend in modern Holmesiana has been to show the great detective as a stunted giant, Ferrell stunts the stuntedness, playing Holmes as a prissy drama queen whoï¿½s at least half idiot and always ï¿½ even when brilliant ï¿½ a fount of chaos. He and his schoolmate, Dr. John Watson (Reilly), have never really left the playground. The rub is not that Ferrell and Reilly act like overgrown 11-year-olds ï¿½ that was the hook in Adam McKayï¿½s Step Brothers, a high-water mark in modern infantile comedy. Itï¿½s that Ferrellï¿½s brand of low comedy is best executed with high instincts ï¿½ i.e., without the nudge-nudges and wink-winks. Watch Ferrell and Reilly make the breathless case to Richard Jenkinsï¿½s exasperated father/stepfather in Step Brothers that they should be allowed to create a bunk bed by setting one twin bed atop another: Their enthusiasm is contagious. Watch the pairï¿½s Funny or Die line-for-line reenactment of the unintentionally surreal duet between Bing Crosby at deathï¿½s door and a joyless David Bowie: so subtle, so sublime. Holmes & Watson, on the other hand, is camp. Worse: rhythmless camp. It has been consistently misdirected by its screenwriter, Etan Coen (no ï¿½h,ï¿½ different guy), whose idea of editing is to make throwaway jokes broad and broad jokes bludgeoning. As a director, Coen commits comedyï¿½s most cardinal sin: He gets between us and the performers. (To see how central rhythm is, watch Reilly and Steve Cooganï¿½s delicate work in Stan and Ollie: The beats ï¿½ and micro-beats ï¿½ are exquisite.) The first 15 minutes or so of Holmes & Watson made me doubt Iï¿½d last the next 90, an impulse to flee that I also detected, with Holmesian sensitivity, in Ralph Fiennes, whoï¿½s stuck playing Dr. Moriarty and/or a look-alike. You can read his frozen face: What did I get myself into? Rob Brydonï¿½s Inspector Lestrade is photographed to appear as diminutive as possible, and the actor gets to show none of his improvisatory gifts. Kelly Macdonald as Mrs. Hudson reveals why sheï¿½s always so endearingly low-key: When she goes big, sheï¿½s like a high-school actress. Rebecca Hall brings both poise and gusto to the part of a woman doctor from America (a rarity in the 19th century), but the direction lets her down. Hall has one of the many potentially great jokes that donï¿½t land because the camera isnï¿½t in the right place: an enlightened bit about women doctors making only 30 cents for every for dollar made by men, followed by a proud account of how she treats female hystericsï¿½ brains with blasts of electricity to shock them into submission. As in many Ferrell-McKay projects (McKay is a producer), thereï¿½s a sprinkling of political jokes (aimed at Trump) and digs at Americaï¿½s gun mania that get laughs because theyï¿½re jarringly anachronistic, not because they have any real wit. But Reilly has such an endearing presence ï¿½ and so much genuine affection for Ferrell ï¿½ that his bits often work in spite of everything. His Watson is a sweet-natured but dim fellow who falls in love with everyone onscreen. His bromance with Holmes remains in full flower, while women leave him downright discombobulated ï¿½ including the severe Queen Victoria (Pam Ferris), whose hand he seizes and strokes, smitten. He goes even more gaga for Hallï¿½s doctor, with whom he performs an autopsy modeled on a famous movie love scene, while Holmes is enraptured by the doctorï¿½s mute sidekick (Lauren Lapkus), who mirrors his practice of voraciously eating raw onions. That gag doesnï¿½t really land, either, but gets a point for weirdness. And Lapkus is all in. Then comes a gorgeous routine, in which Holmes beats Watson at imaginary chess, then rock-paper-scissors, then Battleship. Itï¿½s precise ï¿½ elegant even. Hugh Laurie shows up as Holmesï¿½s brother Mycroft and demonstrates what he and Ferrell can do with a little focus: a telepathic exchange in which they lean in their heads and furrow their brows and bug their eyes. Itï¿½s the height of silliness. Steve Coogan is almost as good as a forger with a metal hand, whose air quotes had me laughing for a full 15 seconds after it ended. Eventually, I relaxed my critical faculties, shrugging off the many, many awful jokes (anything about onanism, an extended coals-to-Newcastle non-gag) and joyfully receiving the good ones. A climactic musical number (it could be a parody of Les Miz) is positively award-worthy. Ferrell and Reilly have real musical chops. I should mention that the audience left the theater in a good mood, unaware (it was the 12:55 p.m. show) of Holmes & Watsonï¿½s Rotten Tomatoes score, which hovered for a while at 0. Iï¿½m happy to bump that up, partly because I cherish the Ferrell-Reilly team, partly because of that musical number. I also worry that we undervalue silliness as we fight the larger fight against ignorance and mendacity in all its manifestations. No brain cells are harmed by Holmes & Watson, just given a few hours to rest and regenerate.""",HBW_Doc9_HolmesAndWatson,HBW,Comedy,Positive,Holmes and Watson
110,HBW_Doc10_HolmesAndWatson,"""While not a perfect movie by any means, there were plenty of funny moments to make this enjoyable. It is what it's suppose to be! Everyone needs to relax and enjoy life more. Hilarious! I was laughing the entire time. Definitely had me tearing up! I really needed a great laugh, and this movie did it for me. Okay. So if you're expecting Benedict Cumberbatch style Holmes, this is not that. But if you've been a fan of Will Ferrell and you like his goofier humor, this is precisely right. I have no idea what high expectations people put on this. It was all the Holmes tropes (his hat, his cocaine addiction, his fight with moriarty) put into a silly, slapstick, gag-reel of irreverent comedy that kept me giggling throughout. Think Funny or Die. Think Zoolander. Think SNL. Do NOT expect a Sherlock Holmes parody. Neither Holmes nor Watson are representative of the characters you imagine. This is lower brow than that, and hilarious. Amazed at the hate this movie gets. Yeah, it's kind of cringe and extremely immature, but so what? There are so many terrible movies out there. This one's just light entertainment. Personally I found it hilarious. I am a massive Will Ferrell fan, and while this doesn't rank with the likes of Talladega Nights or Step Brothers, it's still a good film. I get why a lot of people don't find the jokes funny, but still. It's not THAT bad. Much better than everybody gives it credit for. It may not be as good as Talledega Nights, Step Brothers or Other Guys, but it is still far better than other lame comedies that come out. This movie actually hits differently as the joke setups aren't as elaborate as those other movies, but it hits with a flurry of chuckles instead and I sometimes just laugh at the terrible, funnt accents. This is not American comedy. This is probably not for everyone. But I love the energy between them. I love the satire. I love that the comedy isn't spelled out. I love the references to passed versions of Holmes and its context. I think Will Ferrell is a great actor. I think this is almost his version of Black Adder. Funny weird. I'm completely mystified by the bad reviews this film gets. I saw it in the cinema three times and immediately grabbed the home release. I mean, I'd understand if you don't think it's the funniest film ever, but the worst film of the year? That's nuts. It's definitely, undeniably funny. It's got a fun plot and it looks great. Ferrell and Reilly have a much better rapport in this than in Step Brothers or the awful Talladega Nights, and I'd even go so far as to say the portrayal of Holmes and Watson as characters is far more faithful to the books than all the other recent interpretations. Personally, I think it's utterly hilarious and I watch it again and again - a brilliant film. Come on you grumps, forget about looking cool and give it another go. This is one of the funniest Will Farrell movies on the open market .i have no idea why it got such a bad review . It's on par with step brothers. Must watch. I donï¿½t get audience nor critics - the movie is hilarious, has drive, is well casted - Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly excel in their roles (as does Kelly McDonald) - it has many memorable scenes (ï¿½Checkmate scene in horse cart may be my favorite) - makes fun of B-movie suspense scenes (opening scene), etc. This movie was very funny from start to the very end. This getting a low score from movie critic's makes me wonder about their judgement."",""Don't know what's wrong with people, this is funny, it's a stupid version of a serious show, it has some of the funniest jokes we've seen in a film in a long time.""",HBW_Doc10_HolmesAndWatson,HBW,Comedy,Positive,Holmes and Watson
111,AVC_Doc1_DirtyGrandpa,"""Robert De Niro has been nominated for an Academy Award seven times and has taken home the golden statuette twice. He is, nearly unquestionably, one of Hollywood's truly great actors and is such an iconic figure that it's not difficult to understand why Zac Efron, the former High School Musical star who has struggled to find anything resembling actual fame as an adult actor, would jump at the chance to share the screen with De Niro. Welcome to the world of Razzies, Bob. I'm serious. If De Niro doesn't, at minimum, snag a Razzie nomination for his enthusiastic yet dreadful work in Dirty Grandpa, an aimless and painfully unfunny cinematic hinterland of a film amateurishly directed by frequent Sacha Baron Cohen collaborator Dan Mazer and written by John Phillips, then the Razzies should finally be put to rest. I don't care how many bad films Adam Sandler puts out on Netflix, Dirty Grandpa deserves to be right alongside them. It takes both talent and intelligence to remain a Hollywood icon into your 70's, but it's hard not to wonder if Dirty Grandpa isn't De Niro's Jaws 4, the latter being a film that star Michael Caine acknowledged as being dreadful yet also a film that he's quick to acknowledge bought him a very nice house. Seriously, what did you need Bob? College tuition for the kids? A new home for the missus? The bones of an actual comedy legend like Chaplin? What was it? WHY Bob? Did you have an insatiable need to use the word """"fuck"""" more times than I could count? Does your wife forbid the use of """"cock"""" in the house? Is masturbating to porn a long held secret fantasy? Or are you just so grateful that you've lived past the age of 69 that you'll sign your name to anything now? Stop it. Just stop it. You're better than this, Bob. No, this isn't a film that twenty years from now will be recognized as a comedy great. Instead, it will be almost universally regarded as a cinematic aberration in career that has been for the most part quite stellar. Don't get me wrong. I understand. Heck, I'm getting older myself and these days even a really awesome bowel movement can make me giggle like a schoolboy. The story, and I use that word very loosely, involves the aptly named Dick (De Niro) convincing his grandson Jason (Efron) to drive him from Atlanta to Boca Raton following the death of his wife of four decades. Couldn't he have just hitched a ride with Kevin Hart and Ice Cube? Jason is a straight-laced lawyer a week away from marrying his boss's ultra-controlling daughter (Julianne Hough) and gaining the fast-track to partnership with the firm. Of course, we know within seconds that he's damn well going to go and the two are off in his soon-to-be wife's pink car for adventures that are crying out for a decent director to direct them. While I've been picking on De Niro, that's what you get when you're the star, the truth is that nearly everything that is wrong with Dirty Grandpa, and the list is longer than the grocery list for a Biggest Loser reunion, lies squarely at the feet of director Dan Mazer and a tech crew that makes me wish that those Razzie folks handed out tech awards. The biggest issue may be that Mazer can't decide what kind of film Dirty Grandpa is to be, a comically sincere roadtrip flick or a Korine-esque edgy absurdfest. As Lionsgate doesn't have a history of gross interference in a filmmaker's vision and sure doesn't shy away from edgy cinema, one can only assume that Mazer's cinematic vision is decidedly lacking in cinematic vision. There are moments, fleeting moments, when Dirty Grandpa is funny, though these moments mostly arise out of how completely unfunny the film really is and in watching actors trying to make a go of it. While I'm not opposed to edgy and boundary-pushing humor, even of a socially offensive type, what unfolds in Dirty Grandpa is nothing more than cheap, lazy humor that is immature, undeveloped, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, semi-encouraging of violence without any actual comic pay-off, beyond juvenile and so poorly edited that the vast majority of the comedy bits miss the mark. Aubrey Plaza is a bit of a joy as Lenore, a sex-obsessed college student who repeatedly explains, in graphic detail, what she plans to do with this """"dirty, dirty grandpa."""" While I'm as fond as the next guy, and more than a few girls, of a scantily clad Plaza, the bit becomes tiresome then cumbersome then just plain dumb. There's irresponsible, and comically dead, bits about selling drugs to children, roofies, child molestation and more. Again, I don't necessarily consider these kinds of joke as taboo. In the right film, or the very wrong film, they can actually work. They don't work here. Both De Niro and Efron give it a serious go here. It's almost painful to watch the 72-year-old De Niro attempting to make sense of this raging bullshit. While Efron has made enough bad films that another one isn't exactly alarming, it's still somewhat depressing to see the actor, whose never found a film yet where he won't go bare-chested, squandering away a golden opportunity. I will confess that when I initially saw Dirty Grandpa on the screening list that I thought we may very well have the follow-up to the vastly superior Bad Grandpa, the latter being a Johnny Knoxville vehicle that actually made the concept of a naughty grandpa funny.""",AVC_Doc1_DirtyGrandpa,AVC,Comedy,Negative,Dirty Grandpa
112,AVC_Doc2_DirtyGrandpa,"""One hour and forty-two minutes ï¿½ time I would love to get back but sadly I donï¿½t own a time machine or a Men in Black memory erasing device. Dirty Grandpa is not good and the only time you could envisage yourself watching this film is if youï¿½re with a group of friends and you couldnï¿½t care less at what youï¿½re watching.  But even under those circumstances, I still wouldnï¿½t put this on! Itï¿½s not to say that Iï¿½m a prude or easily offended.  I wasnï¿½t looking for a comedy film that was philosophical or contained some deeper meaning or perspective to life itself. I knew what I was getting into therefore this was not a total surprise ï¿½ the title of the film is a dead giveaway! The simple fact is I wanted to be entertained. Dirty Grandpa doesnï¿½t have those standout moments. Yes you will chuckle at some points but itï¿½s not ï¿½ha haï¿½ funny. Youï¿½ll end up feeling like youï¿½re laughing at the film as a whole, questioning how it got made instead of laughing along with them and the moments that occur. The film is filled with so much vulgarity and profanity that it overwhelms anything else this film had to offer. The jokes are continuously forced as if it wasnï¿½t sure where to end it, filling in the gaps where the plot should be. Trust me, there is a plot ï¿½ itï¿½s hiding in plain sight. In essence, Dirty Grandpa is about second chances, moving on and living life again. Dick Kelly (Robert De Niro) loses his wife to cancer. The last thing she said to him was to ï¿½get back out there againï¿½. On that aspect alone, there is some sentiment especially with the older generation. That being said, it doesnï¿½t take long before the dick jokes, the drug use, the sexual lust, the paedophilia, the gay and lesbian name calling, the N-word and a scene involving masturbation, for it to completely erase that sentiment. Itï¿½s like watching 2-3 films in one, as if you went shopping and got yourself an unexpected bargain. But all it does is cover up how wafer thin the plot is. On one hand you have a OAP coping with his wifeï¿½s death. On the other you have Jason Kelly (Zac Efron), a corporate lawyer whoï¿½s about to get married but is forced to drive his grandpa up to Florida. On this roadtrip, Grandpa Kelly starts to question his grandsonï¿½s life choices and decides to trick him by detouring for some spring break shenanigans in Daytona beach. In conclusion, the plot becomes lost as if it was confused at what point or goal it was trying to achieve. Not surprisingly, it results in an unbalanced film. The story itself is not rocket science but at the same time it offers nothing new. Itï¿½s very predictable and clichï¿½d and if you find yourself guessing how the film is going to end after the first twenty minutes, then you should give yourself a pat on the back because it will be correct. Thereï¿½s too many coincidences or lazy attempts at writing character motivations to justify what happens. I mean what are the chances that Jason would meet one of his former photography classmates, Shadia (Zoey Deutch) during the trip? A comedy is as good as the supporting cast and again this film doesnï¿½t really utilise them.  Dirty Grandpa is filled with a whole range of annoying, stereotypical characters. They become time fillers in a nonsensical plot. For some of those characters, their behaviour is so distracting and exaggerated that it takes away the necessary screen time from De Niro and Efron who are certainly the stronger aspects of Dirty Grandpa. Yet this is the part where I feel sad. Whether youï¿½re a fan of his work or not, De Niroï¿½s legacy as an actor will be cemented with ground breaking films like Casino, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas and Heat ï¿½ just to name a few. Dirty Grandpa will not. In fact itï¿½s not in the same league and will be remembered as a sad, cringeworthy and misguided adventure for an incredible and legendary actor. Watching De Niro in Dirty Grandpa is a distraction, a painful one. If this was his attempt to continually shed off his ï¿½tough guyï¿½ image, then this film was not the right way to go.  The script is not challenging enough as you watch De Niro ï¿½being De Niroï¿½ instead of embodying his character. His character has a secret past but you could argue that itï¿½s ripped from Meet the Parents which is a far superior film in comparison to this. Whilst I canï¿½t deny the hidden sentiment in Dick Kelly, however he spends most of his time sexually lusting after Lenore and vice versa. Iï¿½m not trying to say ï¿½older men donï¿½t have feelingsï¿½ etc, but there are better ways to convey that without coming across as crass, vulgar and cheap. Because itï¿½s De Niro saying the dialogue, you canï¿½t erase that out of your mind. Sad to say, this film is a lowpoint. Dirty Grandpa is a film that knows its target audience. It does have its moments but at the end of the day itï¿½s simply not funny. Thereï¿½s not enough for it to carry the momentum throughout and the jokes end up being woefully misjudged and unnecessary. Save yourself the hassle. If youï¿½re looking for a gross-out comedy there are better examples out there. This film is not one of them.""",AVC_Doc2_DirtyGrandpa,AVC,Comedy,Negative,Dirty Grandpa
113,AVC_Doc3_DirtyGrandpa,"""Zac Efron and Robert De Niro band together for Dirty Grandpa, a not-so-buddy road trip movie that is sure to have you both laughing and wincing. With its no-holds-barred approach to comedy and the two leads great on-screen rapport, director Dan Mazer is able to offer up the perfect R-rated antidote to our cold and gloomy January's. Just don't expect anything that intellectually ground-breaking or moving. The film follows uptight and by-the-book, young lawyer Jason Kelly (Efron) who works at his stuffy father's film and is set to marry his over-bearing fiancï¿½e Meredith (Julianne Hough) in just over a week. Seeing that his grandson is soon to enter into a life of constant """"sleepwalking"""" and being told what to do, Dick (De Niro) guilt-trips Jason into driving him to Florida for his annual holiday, in a last-ditch attempt to make Jason see sense and break free from his oppressed situation. His argument? That his late wife, and Jason's grandmother, would have wanted him to have kept up the tradition. However, Jason soon releases that his grandfather isn't the sweet, grieving man that he expected him to be, and is actually a foul-mouthed old guy who feels like he's missed out on the best years of his life and dreams of the day he can have some fun in the sack with well, anyone, to make up for lost time. Don't get it twisted though, Dick has some redeeming qualities. His sense of family is very much still intact and he remained completely faithful to his wife up until her final days. As if that's something we should praise him hero for, but heck, it kind of does make him a little endearing. With Dirty Grandpa, absolutely anything goes when it comes to the opportunity of owning a gag, which is unsurprising given that it was directed by Borat writer Dan Mazer. A lot of the time, it's actually quite shocking how far both the script and the actors will take the joke, whether it be the up-close shot of a certain part of De Niro we can only hope is a prosthetic, a rapping Dick asking his new """"crew"""" whether he can say the """"n-word"""" or an awkwardly deadpan exchange between him and Lenore that depict in way too much explicit detail what they might do to each other if they ever go """"all the way"""". Often with a movie as outrageous as this, it's all too easy for its stars to ham up their roles but each member seems decently cast. It's obvious that the film would not have worked so well if there had been no chemistry between Efron and De Niro and luckily, the pair have the stuff in abundance. Efron is never quite believable as the stuffy good guy, particularly as we saw him last in films such as Bad Neighbours and We Are Your Friends, but it's this sense of inner conflict over who he is that makes his character seem real. The supporting cast refuse to be overshadowed by the Hollywood heavyweights either, with actors such as Aubrey Plaza and Jason Mantzoukas, who plays stand-out character Tan Pam, consistently elevating the film to even weirder and more hilarious heights. It's fair to say, this film won't impress everyone. It's all too easy to criticise a movie like this one when you're in the midst of Oscar season and there are stunning, moving dramas everywhere you turn. But if the simple goal of a comedy is merely to entertain and make you laugh, then Dirty Grandpa more than succeeds. It might use questionable methods to get there, but it reaches its destination in the end with a surprisingly touching penultimate scene. Bet you never thought you'd see Parks And Recreation's Plaza gyrating on a cigar-smoking De Niro in a neon-lighted club on the big screen, now did you?

It is in no way cerebral and if you are the kind of person that is easily offended then don't watch it. From start to finish this movie is full of belly laughs, it is as abusive as it possibly could be and still get through the censor system. There are swastikas, dicks, the N word is used, there are references to rape but they are all within context in what will prove to be one of the funniest movies of the year. The haters on here that are giving low scores are obviously missing something or are ardent De Niro fans who are disappointed with his appearance alongside Zac Ephron. This is not The Godfather guys; this is Driving Miss Daisy meets American Pie and the result is almost perfect. I imagine that the cast and crew had as much fun making this film as I did watching it. I suppose it is aimed at an audience of a certain age but if you have an ounce of humour in your body you will enjoy it from start to finish. Some of the characters may appear irrelevant but that only adds to the charm, the crazy drug dealer, the two jocks and the police officers all add a little spark to the movie and are in their own way as funny as the main characters. Although not family friendly and possibly not suitable for under 18s (in my opinion) this movie should appeal to almost anyone who wants an amusing distraction without having to focus on deep plot lines and pretentious scene settings. Have a few beers and watch this with your other half or with your pals, you will not regret it! A very successful comedy, that made me laugh out loud, as I have not laughed in a long film. Robert De Niro and Zac Efron plays flawlessly, you have nothing to reproach them, comical phases are a lot, not the kind of comedy with just a few scenes, but one that hearty laugh, I can say that is worth seeing. But now depends on the type of humor that we each agree, this movie has many moments and perverse aftershocks, people who do not have liked movies like American Pie, do not recommend this film because it is similar. Otherwise the film worth seeing. By far the best comedy seen in the last many, many years! I recommend !! I love De Niro and gives earned the right to play and-not that kind of film that you see it's OK, if not, it's not a loss, but I think it was a lot of fun.

But Efron is the opposite ï¿½ until his drink is spiked, he inhales epic amounts of crack and wakes on a beach naked save for a novelty thong and a swastika of penises drawn on his forehead, before having to FaceTime his parents, fiancee and rabbi. Is that upcoming wedding really a good idea? And was grandpaï¿½s road trip really as self-serving as it seemed? De Niro gives it serious welly, grinding and leering, reeling off endless cracked pearls of wisdom, half Larry David, half Sid James. What seemed to some like an Oscar-winner embarrassing himself looks to me a bravely-committed comedic turn. The other performances almost match him. Somewhere along the line, Efron surprise-mutated into one of Hollywoodï¿½s best straight men and his evolution here from squeaky-clean law bore to nude batty party fiend ï¿½ never quite losing the panic in his eyes ï¿½ is tremendous. Elsewhere, predictable casting is leant on to good effect. Aubrey Plaza, as a college girl who trades amazingly frank banter with De Niro is as winning as sheï¿½s ever been, while Jason Mantzoukas does his usual crazed cameo (this time as Pam, a drug-dealing father of six and mayoral candidate) ï¿½ and does it better than ever. This movie is unbelievably hilarious. Some of the quotes from it are pure gold. Perhaps if you're more of an uptight person you won't like it because yes it's raunchy and raw. But that's how life is, right? If you want a good, pure laugh session PLEASE watch this movie. I've seen it 6 times now and I still can't stop laughing from start to finish! Perfectly cast and crude ridiculous humour that has those now easily offended laughing the night away. Excellent film! Great movie for ordinary folks who still like 'dirty old man' movies. Nothing here is PC. It's dirty and crass and reminds me of the 'good le days' of my youth (older guy here). It's definitely one of the best movies of its type out there. I downloaded it a few months back and just watched it my 4th or 5th time. The jokes don't get old and there are some good social issues interweaved into the story that gives it a great ending. I won't give any spoilers. I'll just say to watch it and enjoy!""",AVC_Doc5_DirtyGrandpa,AVC,Comedy,Positive,Dirty Grandpa

Zac Efron plays the straight-laced lawyer boy, Jason Kelly who reluctantly agrees to drive his recently widower Grandfather to Florida, too soon. before his wedding. Robert De Niro slips comfortably into comedy mode and becomes this lecherous dirty old man on a mission to get himself laid, and possibly his grandson on the way. De Niro is stand-alone brilliant and steals the entire film. He's the Grandpa you're so ashamedly proud of, justifying his disgusting behaviour and attitude as he verbally slaps people in the face, sometimes physically. It's a role I can no longer see someone else do. He is the dirty Grandpa. What ensues is a totally wacky and hilarious road trip, not totally unbelievable, but way up there with silly over-the-top comical situations. Efron looks like he's been set up and pranked upon constantly, by his own Gramps who has quite a few tricks up his sleeve and possibly some state secrets too. The script is loaded with clever put-downs, mostly delivered by De Niro, with a heavy does of sarcasm. Plenty of awkward situations, and inappropriate embarrassments but without going to the extremes like some of the comedies released this year. It's just silly and the plot holes are quickly ignored due to the hilarities. Zoey Deutch and Aubrey Piaz pretty much make up the rest of the supporting cast, and the targets for De Niro, causing a major distraction for Efron who's soon to be married and cannot forget with the needy, dominating wife-to-be constantly calling for colour schemes, rehearsal arrangements and press releases. It's predictable but that doesn't ruin the film, it's like you already know the story and how it's going to pan out but it's then remixed comedy style which makes it forgivable. It doesn't pretend to be anything but a funny comedy. I've said before, all good comedies need good soundtracks, and this one is a great example of that, making full use of a suitable mixture to create the perfect atmosphere. It's proper laugh out loud funny, especially Jason Mantzoukas' Classic Pam. I suppose it's comedy I can kind of relate to, reminding me of my pals. It's a road trip with pals that's on always on form. Non-stop heckles, and pranks come-backs.

117,AVC_Doc7_DirtyGrandpa,"""In 2016, this head-scratching cinematic anomaly belongs to """"Dirty Grandpa,"""" a movie so annoying, so ugly, so lead-footed, so misguided, and so blisteringly unfunny it has to be seen to be believed. Please don't see it, though. It's not worth the sacrifice. Directed by Dan Mazer (2013's likable revisionist romantic comedy """"I Give It a Year"""") and written by John Phillips, """"Dirty Grandpa"""" is tone-deaf, hostile and endlessly unpleasant. There is a fine line between ribald and unremittingly obnoxious, and this film crosses it in the first scene and stays there for an unbelievable 108 minutes. In a race to humiliate every actor involved, Mazer and Phillips have created a conveyor belt of caricaturized human monstrosities for them to portray. No one escapes unscathed, though in a different movie set on a planet more closely resembling Earth, Zac Efron's (2014's """"Neighbors"""") Jason may have been a suitable protagonist. The movie's thesis presupposes that Jason is an unhappy guy who has given up his love of photography for a career in law, and who is about to make a big mistake if he goes through with his marriage to Meredith. This latter observation may be true, but the former one does not take into account that he genuinely appears to enjoy being a lawyer. Moreover, just because he works as an attorney doesn't mean he still can't take pictures. Dick wants his grandson to give up his focused grown-up life and instead party so hard he is arrested twice in two days. None of this makes any sense. The rest of the characters are the kind of people you wouldn't just cross the street to avoid in real life, but would take a detour around the city so you wouldn't have to be in their general vicinity. Robert De Niro (2015's """"The Intern"""") embarrasses himself as the interminable Dick Kelly, put into situations less amusing than simply depressing (the sight of him pleasuring himself to a porno is the kind of raunchy gag without a punchline only 12-year-olds would find a laugh riot). Unfiltered in an off-puttingly aggressive way, he objectifies every woman he meets and nonchalantly spits out homophobic remarks directed at Shadia and Lenore's friend Tyrone (Brandon Mychael Smith), then later hypocritically lectures someone about not discriminating against him. A heart-to-heart talk Dick shares with Jason where he waxes philosophic about his manly urges to have sex with anything that moves is meant to give the viewer insight into his motives, but only serves to make him seem all the more sad and miserable. The usually effervescent Julianne Hough (2013's """"Safe Haven"""") is trapped in the offensively thankless role of Jason's controlling fiancï¿½e Meredith, a self-involved, Type-A personality with few redeeming qualities. A key reveal late in the picture involving her character is reprehensible, an illogical discovery shoehorned in to make her even less sympathetic than the horror show she already has been established to be. As Jason's eventual love interest, the supposedly more down-to-earth Shadia, Zoey Deutch (2013's """"Beautiful Creatures"""") isn't exactly ingratiating; she is introduced by covertly stealing from Jason and using the money on his table to pay for her diner bill. A lot of Dick's negativity is leveled at his son, David, for being uppity and humorless, but there is no actual evidence of either of these things. Dermot Mulroney's (2015's """"Insidious: Chapter 3"""") part asks that he have nothing to do except run around in the third act with a half-dozen penises drawn on his face. If any performance shows a modicum of promise, it is Aubrey Plaza's (2014's """"Life After Beth"""") goofy, uninhibited turn as Lenore. Sadly, this character might be the most over-the-top exaggeration of them all, a smiley nymphomaniac who has only one thing on her mind throughout (hint: it isn't Dick's personality). Worse still, Plaza is stranded by a hopeless script that treats her like a gimmick instead of a person. """"Dirty Grandpa"""" has no point, no sense of comic timing, and no jokes clever enough to be considered jokes at all. Supporting characters include a conspiracy-theorizing cousin (Adam Pally) who makes a scene at his grandma's casket, a pair of inept cops (Mo Collins and Henry Zebrowski) who give Jason a pair of semen-coated pants to wear out of jail, a drug-dealing store clerk named Pam (Jason Mantzoukas) who thinks nothing of shooting up his own store because, after all, it's Florida (har, har!), and a beefy but barely overweight college jock, Brah (Michael Hudson), whose sole purpose for existing is so he can be on the receiving end of a stream of fat put-downs. Toss in insults directed at gay characters and the offensive use of a disabled person whose disability is meant to be the pinnacle of comedic hilarity, and what we have is an absolutely disgraceful assault on its genre. """"Dirty Grandpa"""" is painful, charmless and cruel, carrying a bleak outlook on humanity legitimately alarming to behold. Even viewed as nothing more than a frivolous trifle, it is stomach-churning in its contempt for audiences.""",AVC_Doc7_DirtyGrandpa,AVC,Comedy,Negative,Dirty Grandpa
118,AVC_Doc8_DirtyGrandpa,"""It's one of those boilerplates about an uptight guy on the eve of marrying a harridan taking a road trip with a free spirit to discover that maybe he doesn't want to spend the rest of his life (or the few years until he secures a divorce--the subtext of these things is always curiously traditional) selling out to The Man. Jason (Zac Efron) is that potential sell-out. You can tell because he dresses like the villain from an Eighties college sex comedy, is a corporate lawyer, and is engaged to a materialistic bimbo (Julianne Hough) who will justify his unconscionable hedonism by being a secret slut herself in his absence. The best of these films is its prototype, obviously (Capra's It Happened One Night), but the one I return to most often is Bronwen Hughes's curiously sticky--if only to me--Forces of Nature. The high concept this time around is that De Niro is the free-spirit road-tripper in a role that asks him to, literally at one point, be rapping grandmother Ellen Dow from The Wedding Singer. The imposition of this masterplot is really the only thing separating the film from """"Jackass"""" spin-off Bad Grandpa, just as one word is the only thing separating the two concepts. De Niro's Dick (and you do indeed get to see his dick--though admittedly, it's probably a stunt dick) is a former Green Beret, by the way, which explains/doesn't explain why he gets a Presidio fight sequence against a bunch of black hoods who've been taunting a gay black guy Dick has also recently been taunting. There are many ways you could go in attacking something like Dirty Grandpa. The easiest is to lament the fall of arguably the greatest actor from the greatest period in the history of film, to rend clothing and ululate about how De Niro has begun cashing checks in his dotage. It's tempting to use clever turns of phrase like """"Aging Bull"""" as shorthand to avoid engaging with it. The hard way to approach Dirty Grandpa is to try to draw it into the larger conversation of what's happened to the state of our state when stuff like this is right there on the verge of being accepted as the new social lingua franca. It's the movie version of Donald Trump and Sarah Palin. There's no thesis, just provocation upon non sequitur provocation. (Actually, the other thing separating Dirty Grandpa from Bad Grandpa is that the latter offers variations on a theme--societal prejudices towards the elderly--and so its own disjointedness feels more purposeful.) Many describe their style of politicking as """"impressionistic"""" (nonsystemic/subjective) and it is assuredly at least that, and Dirty Grandpa falls under that umbra as well--but it's more than that, isn't it? The image I get in my head is of a probe that hits the spot for which it's probing. Explanation, if you're willing to stretch, for why De Niro's titular grandpa habitually greets his grandson Jason with a thumb jammed up his ass. The hardest way to approach Dirty Grandpa, in other words, is by taking seriously this idea that De Niro's late career is not merely a diary of his eroding cognition, perhaps, but also as interesting a sociological document as his early work playing disaffected young men (Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, et al) alienated by and in tension against the culture at large. When Jason recreates the finale of The Graduate, in a scene laced with hatred towards disability, endorsement of philandering, and a photo of a dog butt-fucking a former Disney child star, it is, as far as snapshots of the conversation in the United States circa 2016 go, not half bad. Dirty Grandpa is the epitome of facile. If challenged, it'll fall back on the red meat; left unchallenged, it'll fester and spawn. It's like a facehugger in that way. The movie opens with Dick's wife dying, leaving Dick with this burning desire to fuck again before he himself dies. There's a cameo from Danny Glover that's very, very hard to take, as Glover is now sincerely too old for this shit. More difficult to take yet is the film's repeated insistence on doing the """"I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding"""" reassurance that its extreme nihilism is supported by a heart of gold. It's the nadir of the Judd Apatow school of lacking the courage of its convictions. There's lots of leering, lots of Aubrey Plaza as a disgusting caricature who suddenly throws into harsh relief exactly how intelligent much of Amy Schumer's shtick is, and lots of stuff like how, after an all-night roofie and crack bender, all Jason wants is to be a photographer and hang out with his college hippie girlfriend (Zoey Deutch, somewhere between Isla Fisher and Anna Kendrick). How about how Dick likes to say things like """"nigger"""" and """"retard"""" but ultimately just wants to heal his relationship with his estranged son (Dermot Mulroney or Dylan McDermott) and help Jason be true to his inner granola/snag douchebag? Efron reminds me of Alain Delon circa Purple Noon, and I gotta say, I'd be pretty excited to see him as Ripley in another Highsmith adaptation. He has a blank, sociopathic quality that's to his credit rather than detriment. In Dirty Grandpa, on him, you can see reflected the serene incomprehension of all modern discourse. I don't even know at the end of the day if he's supposed to be Jewish or Catholic in this picture. It doesn't even matter.""",AVC_Doc8_DirtyGrandpa,AVC,Comedy,Negative,Dirty Grandpa
119,AVC_Doc9_DirtyGrandpa,"""Dirty Grandpa opens with a funeral. Five minutes later, when you witness Robert De Niro in a shameless, shameful moment of self-pleasure, you'll wish it was yours. The movie is a relentless and unapologetic display of tasteless comedy, and please note, I do not describe it as a display of bad taste. Now, please bear with me as I split the hair: bad taste, by strict definition, at least implies the existence of taste. Classical works of bad taste - e.g., John Waters' films, """"South Park,"""" Robert Downey Jr.'s performance in """"Tropic Thunder"""" - traffic in intellectual discomfort, challenging the way we define the status quo. Tasteless dreck such as """"Dirty Grandpa"""" and large swaths of Adam Sandler's filmography prompt physical discomfort - nausea, wincing - as the body instinctively attempts to expel or repel intellectual poison. This is an admittedly convoluted and pretentious way of saying """"Dirty Grandpa"""" is terrible, just terrible. It's aggressively bad, missing comedic targets by miles, like an Olympic archer firing boiled green beans instead of arrows. The subtitle could be """"Randy Robbie Goes on Spring Break,"""" and if you're tempted to lament De Niro's career downslide, keep in mind, his filmography in the 21st century has been a bumpy ride at best. Of course, this may be the most awful thing he's ever done, which, considering """"Meet the Fockers"""" and """"Hide and Seek,"""" is saying a lot. De Niro plays Dick Kelly, an Army retiree who just lost his wife to cancer. He guilts his preppie-hipster grandson Jason (Zac Efron) into driving him to Boca Raton, promising a road trip with sweet, sad ol' Gramps, when he's actually a randy ol' pervert. A classic bait-and-switch! He's lusty, not dusty, spewing crass euphemisms for genitalia, guzzling booze, rubbing up against women on the golf course, accusing Jason of being homosexual because he can't keep up. A running joke has Dick jamming his thumb up Jason's hindquarters whenever he bends over. """"I want to (expletive)!"""" Dick bellows. """"I want to (expletive) a horse and drink its blood!"""" It's the kind of thing that might be great to hear De Niro say in """"Taxi Driver 2"""" or something. But here, in a mainstream comedy, standing next to a deer-in-the-headlights Efron, reciting from a script written to impress 14-year-old boys sneaking a peek when mom and dad aren't home, it's pathetic, a waste of his potential for the dark and twisted. They divert to Daytona Beach, following Shadia (Zoey Deutch), a hippie former classmate of Jason's, and trashy sexpot Lenore (Aubrey Plaza), who has a preference for old men. Whenever Jason complains about not only deviating from the plan, but also being distracted from preparing for his pending nuptials to his controlling fiancee Meredith (Julianne Hough), Dick calls him a euphemism for female genitalia. They go to an out-of-control Spring Break party with the girls, and beer leads to drugs leads to Jason waking up on the beach with a swastika of phalluses drawn on his forehead, naked except for a plush bee strapped to his crotch - please don't ask, I just don't have it in me - which, of course, prompts a little boy to ask him to pet it. Dan Mazer directs this mess with a remarkable eye for butts. Butts, butts, butts. Male butts, female butts. Bikini'd butts, naked butts, butts jabbed by thumbs. Writer John Phillips complements this visual aesthetic with a remarkable ear for what comes out of butts. When his words aren't naughty in the hope of generating cheap laughs - ISN'T IT FUNNY WHEN A SEPTUAGENARIAN MAKES JOKES ABOUT SEMEN is the screaming subtext here - they're corn syrup of the highest fructose, smarmy sentimentality about how Jason's father (Dermot Mulroney) strained father-son-grandson relationships by being a superficial creep and urging Jason to be a soulless, square, empty corporate lawyer. I smirked twice in 102 minutes, at the following lines: """"This is Florida. Everything is a licensed gun range!"""", and Plaza's character referring to Efron's perfectly coiffed, manicured and sweatervested person as """"A Mitt Romney Terminator."""" By spoiling the best jok s, I've hopefully saved you about nine bucks, money better spent on lottery tickets or donated to a dung beetle appreciation scholarship. Now, I'm no prude; I've recently enjoyed the coarse comedy of """"Neighbors,"""" """"Ted,"""" """"The Night Before"""" and Judd Apatow's efforts, sometimes against my better judgment. Puerile toilet humor can be deployed with wit, in the service of character or satire, when filmmakers put in the effort. """"Dirty Grandpa"""" is lazy, pathetic and stupid, and while it won't put you in the ground, it may fill you with regret, temporarily muddle your intellect or make you wonder if there's any hope for Hollywood or humanity.

Sure the plot is a little thin and the relationship development between Efrons character and the hippie dippy girl would need more in real life, but let's not kid ourselves. We're not going to this movie for a teeth crunching, heart throbbing romance or in depth character driven performances. We're going for laughs and to see Zac shirtless and accidentally high on pot or crack (he's not sure which). And shirtless. And oh my god does that man deliver. I almost had conniptions. Or kittens.

And the next 3-4 mins became a little bit """"woah, really? Did you have to go there?"""" and even Mr Efron looks like he was wishing he didn't have to be doing that scene. No one really laughed then. But his Horny Grandpa is so laugh out loud funny and outrageous and De Niro played off brilliantly against the equally funny Uni student played by Aubrey Plaza. These two were on fire and looked like they were enjoying every sleazy, delicious minute. Every word they delivered to each other produced roars of laughter from the audience. At one point I was in tears. Of laughter. Not disgust because I wasn't expecting The Deer Hunter. the majority of the gags hit their marks and hit them hard. I laughed more in this than I have in any Hollywood comedy for quite some time, mostly thanks to Dan Mazerï¿½s wickedly filthy script. In addition to the jokes, thereï¿½s a lot to enjoy in Dirty Grandpa. Thereï¿½s a solid cameo by Danny Glover, kicked off with an awesome introduction involving TV show Alf. Then thereï¿½s a Terminator reference, a Starship Troopers quote and an outstanding Andre the Giant anecdote. This movie is amazing and it doesn't deserve all the hate it got from the critics. I had a really good time in the movie theatre and I think you could too if you like this kind of humor. Many people dislike this film because of its humor and bad language, but it does what it does bloody well, De Niro and Aubrey Plaza in particular are great and I laughed my ass off.

121,VVD_Doc1_NoTimeToDie,"""What a ride it has been for Daniel Craig. He first slid into the tuxedo of the dapper 007 back in 2006. Fifteen years and five movies later Craig wraps up his terrific run with the 25th installment in the James Bond franchise, ï¿½No Time to Dieï¿½. Due to several reasons (a global pandemic chief among them), we havenï¿½t had a Bond film since 2015. Thatï¿½s a long time, but Iï¿½m happy to say it was well worth the wait.I was pretty lukewarm on James Bond movies until Craig came along. His first entry ï¿½Casino Royaleï¿½ blew me away. I like his second film, the flawed ï¿½Quantum of Solaceï¿½ more than most. I loved his third movie ï¿½Skyfallï¿½ but was more mixed on his fourth, ï¿½Spectreï¿½. With ï¿½No Time to Dieï¿½, Craig is given the chance to end his tenure on a sky-high note. And boy does he.Directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, ï¿½No Time to Dieï¿½ comes packaged with everything you want from a Bond movie ï¿½ big action, even bigger characters, plenty of style, and a special dash of heart. But Craigï¿½s movies have added grit to that list. His Bond carries the weight of loss, and his pain often pushes him outside the bounds of agency protocol. That emotional burden and his willingness to cross the line are traits that set his 007 apart from all the rest.This near $300 million sequel comes with a collection of old familiar faces as well as a few new ones. And once again this latest world-saving mission takes Bond (and us) to locations across the globe ï¿½ Italy, Jamaica, Cuba, Norway, and of course London. And then you have the story itself which is not only thrilling blockbuster material, but it nails the tricky task of completing Daniel Craigï¿½s story arc. And it does it in an profoundly satisfying way.The film begins with James having retired from MI6 and enjoying what resembles a normal life with Madeleine (a returning Lï¿½a Seydoux). But while on a romantic getaway in the exquisitely shot Matera, Italy, the couple are reminded why theyï¿½re always looking over their shoulders. Assassins sent by the nefarious crime syndicate Spectre ambush James leading to an exhilarating action sequence through the heart of the scenic city. Bond and Madeleine manage to escape, but he suspects her of betraying and the two split up.Five years and one Billie Eilish Bond theme later, James is living in seclusion on a beach in Jamaica when heï¿½s contacted by old friend and CIA field officer Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright). Felix needs Bondï¿½s help tracking down a kidnapped scientist (David Dencik) who has developed a DNA-targeting bioweapon known as ï¿½Project Heraclesï¿½. Obviously, in the wrong hands the bioweapon could be catastrophic. And those hands happen to belong to Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek), a soft-spoken yet vengeful terrorist leader who has an axe to grind with Spectre and has a rather gnarly connection to Madeleineï¿½s past. And just like that, Bond is back in the game.From there the road gets curvier. Bond butts heads with MI6, particularly M (Ralph Fiennes) and a brash young 00 agent named Nomi (Lashana Lynch). The devilish Ernst Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) is still running Spectre from prison. And of course Madeleine resurfaces, now working as a psychotherapist for MI6, a job that puts her right in the crosshairs of the string-pulling madman Safin. And there are even more characters with parts to play including CIA agent Paloma (a wide-eyed and delightful Ana de Armas) who assists Bond in Cuba. And of course Q (Ben Whishaw) and Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) make welcomed returns.But this is very much Bondï¿½s movie. Not just in the traditional sense, but personally and emotionally. From its action-packed earliest frames, ï¿½No Time to Dieï¿½ has a different pull than Craigï¿½s other films in the franchise. Part of it may be psychological. We know this is Craigï¿½s last ride and that realization inevitably adds some extra feeling for fans. But itï¿½s also a conscious move from Fukunaga who manages to keep his film tonally in-tune with the others while putting a warm and empathetic spotlight on the weary and pained super spy. Itï¿½s a slippery balancing act, but Fukunaga nails it. Also, the movie looks amazing. Whether heï¿½s capturing a location or shooting an elaborate action sequence, Oscar-winning DP Linus Sandgren always gives us something worth looking at. I mentioned the stunning opening in Italy. Thereï¿½s also an impeccably shot edge-of-your-seat car chase/shootout in Norway. And of course, the big finish which features one particularly jaw-dropping close-quartered gunfight up a flight of stairs. Sandgren is constantly treating us to one breathtaking shot after another and frequently reminding us of why movies are always better on the big screen.ï¿½But what may be most impressive is how the movie flies by despite a hefty running time of 2 hours 43 minutes. I only checked my watch once and that was out of curiosity rather than boredom. Much of it has to do with Fukunagaï¿½s crisp pacing and steady mix of drama and action. He never lets things get bogged down. At the same time, he never loses sight of his characters. Again, itï¿½s a balance the film maintains that keeps it lively and engaging. So how does ï¿½No Time to Dieï¿½ match up with Craigï¿½s other Bond movies. Well, Iï¿½m not ready to put it next to the superb ï¿½Casino Royaleï¿½, but itï¿½s only a step or two below it. Not only has Cary Joji Fukunaga made a good Bond movie, but this is the kind entertainment I look for out of blockbusters. But perhaps most important for 007 fans, Fukunaga gives Craig a swan song that does him and his fifteen years spent On Her Majestyï¿½s Secret Service justice. Itï¿½s a top-to-bottom fabulous finish for (dare I even say it) my favorite Bond of the franchise. ï¿½No Time to Dieï¿½ opens today in theaters.""",VVD_Doc1_NoTimeToDie,VVD,Action,Positive,No Time to Die
122,VVD_Doc2_NoTimeToDie,"""Before you ask, let me answer the question at the forefront of your mind: Inï¿½No Time To Die, someoneï¿½doesï¿½say, ï¿½You know what time it is? ï¿½ Time to die!ï¿½ The question is not directed at James Bond, but itï¿½s still important that you know that.ï¿½Because here is also the thing [spoiler coming, better stop reading if you donï¿½t wanna be spoiled, here we go]: James Bond does die. And not in a way the franchise could easily squirm out of it (though it wouldnï¿½t be theï¿½dumbest stunt a franchise has ever tried to pull). At the end ofï¿½No Time To Die, Bond stares down incoming missiles as he talks on the phone with his lady love, knowing her and his daughter were safe from harm. After several decades of adventures, the man has finally perished.ï¿½More than a week out, the thing that lingers with me is how conservative the ending feels. Bond died saving the world, as we always knew he might. He ensured the girl was good, like he often did. But ultimatelyï¿½No Timeï¿½presents his death as if it is his only option: heï¿½s mortally wounded, sure (like, heï¿½s been worse probably), but really itï¿½s the nanobots heï¿½s been infected with that would kill his child and love were he ever to touch them again.* Once infected, he moves slowly, mentally working his way through any possibility for escape from certain doom. But it becomes clear before too long that he has resigned himself to his fate. His death may come from a bomb, but James Bond dies of a broken heart.ï¿½There shouldnï¿½t be anything surprising about it, I suppose, even in a world where James Bond has now canonically died. The Bond world was never a close study in continuity, even in the serial installments of the Daniel Craig era; it should be easy enough to slot in a new Bond actor somewhere along the timeline, maybe even with a wink to the timey-wimeyness of it all.ï¿½ That ï¿½James Bond will Returnï¿½, as the end credits have always teased, feels less like a promise and more like a threat. Bondï¿½could represent a new world, but probably heï¿½llï¿½always be James Bond, fantasy masculinity. The surprising thing is that Bond needed a reason to die, and that the reason should be the deprivation of his partner and child. Thereï¿½s a world I can imagine where the fact that he could never touch them would be the way we write this little family out of the story completely, so he may still jetsetting and kicking ass. Butï¿½No Time To Die(blessedly) couldnï¿½t imagine that. The film recognizes the heartbreak as a death sentence, and James Bond goes gentle into that dark night, having already spent most of the near three hours of its runtime pushing her away.ï¿½As for the rest of the film, is it worth it? Itï¿½s not terrible. Having seenï¿½a number of 2 _+ hour movies in the theaterï¿½over the past few weeks Iï¿½ve grown a bit numb and even appreciative of the privilege of spending three hours in a dark theater, to the point where I feel I have to warn people that only they can justify the runtime to themselves.ï¿½No Timeï¿½breaks up nicely into hour or so chunks, so you can do theï¿½Irishmanï¿½thing andï¿½watch it like a miniseries. But there is something to sitting and taking in the whole of Bondï¿½s machismo acrossï¿½No Time To Die, as it stretches and unfurls. You see the cracks Craig has worked to put in his foundation, his hardheadedness and fragility. How deaths wear on him and echo back through his time on screen. How he loves; how he stops himself from love.ï¿½I didnï¿½t come from a Bond family, and I will not say this performance is the definitive Bond. But I will say that the more I reflect on it Daniel Craig feels like the only person who could have shepherded this role from the highs ofï¿½Casino Royaleï¿½to the place it ended up. His installments were increasingly self-serious, bruising, and sometimes dull. But they did seem to be aware of the heart of the man, even if they could only sometimes sell us on the chemistry. For being love of each otherï¿½s life, Bond and Swann are incredibly wooden around each other.ï¿½ If James Bond needed a reason to go out, Craig is maybe the only person who couldï¿½ve sold us on it.ï¿½I, briefly in the theater, thought the nanobots he had been injected with would killï¿½anyone, rather than just being designed around the DNA of his loved ones. And honestly the idea of Daniel Craig wishingï¿½goodbye to a franchise that he grew antagonistic towardsï¿½while leaving Bond incapable of screwing, let alone touching anyone still makes me cackle.ï¿½""",VVD_Doc2_NoTimeToDie,VVD,Action,Positive,No Time to Die
123,VVD_Doc3_NoTimeToDie,"""No Time to Die, the latest and last appearance of Daniel Craig as James Bond, is a lot of movie. Itï¿½s so much movie that one hardly knows where to begin. So letï¿½s start with the runtime, which carries on for 165 minutes. Long movies donï¿½t deter me, assuming the time is well spent, but this one felt overstuffed. Director Cary Joji Fukanaga, the first American director to helm an entry in the franchiseï¿½s 60-year history, gives the audience plenty to contemplate, and not all of it feels essential or necessary. Fukanaga and his posse of screenwritersï¿½including Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Phoebe Waller-Bridgeï¿½concoct a script chock full of elaborate plotting, drearily murky characters, and weighty themes. These writers have much to do, crafting the final Craig entry. Their screenplay must weave together the narrative threads from the last four movies, starting withï¿½Casino Royaleï¿½(2006). They must consider the seriesï¿½ clandestine evil organizations and strained relationships, both personal and professional. At the same time, the audience expects rousing action sequences, death puns, and daring spycraft. Plus, unique toï¿½No Time to Dieï¿½is a sense of closure and finality to the Craig run, ensuring that its star never has to return to the franchise he love-hates. As I mentioned, itï¿½s a lot. Devoted fans of the franchise will eat up this hardy helping of cinematic comfort food with a delirious smile, content that the filmmakers have planned a glorious final chapter for their hero. After nearly two years of delays due to the pandemic, the fact that weï¿½re seeing the movie at all seems like something that mightï¿½ve never happened. But here we are, and boy howdy, is it a lot. Itï¿½s not merely the latest spy-actioner in the series; itï¿½s a sprawling and contemplative movie about the baggage we carry. Early inï¿½No Time to Die, Bond and his new lover fromï¿½Spectreï¿½(2015), Madeline Swann (Lï¿½a Seydoux), vacation in the Mediterranean. She wants him to say goodbye to his past, namely Vesper, the femme fatale who broke his heart inï¿½Casino Royale, and only then will Madeline shareï¿½herï¿½past. This is a movie obsessed with the past. Its characters have been scarred and remain unable to move beyond their histories. Eventually, Bond comes to terms with Vesper and her betrayal, but in doing so, he finds reason to suspect that Madeline works for the super-secret villain club, Spectre. Since he can no longer trust her, Bond leaves Madeline and retires to a beach in Jamaica. Five years pass, meaning the characters have stewed in their unresolved conflicts for half a decade. But their issues with the past go further back as well. In a pre-credits scene, a preadolescent Madeline finds her childhood home in Norway attacked by a masked man, Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek). To exact revenge for his familyï¿½s murder, Lyutsifer wants to kill Mr. White, who is Madelineï¿½s father and the baddie from earlier movies, but heï¿½ll take Whiteï¿½s wife and child instead. After killing the mother, Lyutsifer shows mercy on Madeline and saves her. He uses this life debt later in the movie when he needs Madeline to carry out an assassinationï¿½an ultimatum he delivers in Malekï¿½s droning and daresay Jared Leto-esque mannerisms. ï¿½Heï¿½s weird,ï¿½ remarks one of Madelineï¿½s coworkers rudely, though sheï¿½s not wrong. Lyutsifer, whose name my spell checker wants to auto-correct to Lucifer, is an absurd villain with a shortsighted end-the-world scheme that feels concocted by screenwriters and not by ideology or emotion. He plans to sell engineerable nanobots to the highest bidder, giving the buyer the power to select their target according to a DNA profile. They can be used to kill one person in a crowded room, or they can be used to wipe out an entire race. Stakes aside,ï¿½No Time to Dieï¿½forces its characters to make life-and-death decisions based on the pastï¿½s magnetic pull. Everyone has regrets and scars, some quite literal in Lyutsiferï¿½s case (his face consists of milky flesh, occasionally covered by a cracked doll mask). Everyoneï¿½s plagued by their mistakes and need for redemption or revenge. You can feel this oppressive weight in nearly every scene. But there are two exceptions. The first comes in an effervescent sequence that takes Bond to Cuba and pairs him with Paloma (Ana de Armas), a sprightly young agent whose all-too-brief scenes might be the only time this movie evokes a smile or has fun. The other is Nomi (Lashana Lynch), the new 007 with something to prove. Sheï¿½s around for much longer and supplies a constant reminder that Bondï¿½s time has passed. Refreshingly,ï¿½No Time to Dieï¿½doesnï¿½t call out how the new generation of superagents finally includes non-white men and women, and it avoids overemphasizing its inclusiveness. But unfortunately, the script gives them little to do besides aid Bond in his mission. The plotï¿½s machinations send him from Cuba to Norway to a small Japanese island, where the story comes to a close in Lyutsiferï¿½s secret lair, a former missile complex. Fukanaga delivers a good-looking movie with a couple of fine action sequences, butï¿½No Time to Dieï¿½doesnï¿½t dazzle. In the wake ofï¿½Skyfall(2011), itï¿½s difficult to imagine another James Bond movie looking half as good, thereby making every subsequent entry a mild disappointment. Cinematographer Linus Sandgren uses a foggy Norwegian forest for a gorgeous shootout, and production designer Mark Tildesley creates some memorable sets, particularly the cell holding Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) and Lyutsiferï¿½s aforementioned lair. Thereï¿½s an impressive extended take, recalling the one inï¿½Atomic Blondeï¿½(2017), where Bond makes his way up some stairs and takes out a barrage of bad guys, and itï¿½s edited together to look like a single shot. Somehow, all of this makes less of an impact than Lisa-Dorah Sonnet, the little girl who plays the daughter of Madeline and Bond. Her delicate presence and quiet French voice humanize our hero in a way not felt sinceï¿½Casino Royale. They remind us that beneath the surface of Craigï¿½s Bond, his harsh expressions, clenched jaw, and alcohol dependency, lies someone wounded, melancholic, and in need of someone else to love and trust. Trust is difficult to come by in the spy game. So are happy endings, apparently. Craigï¿½s finale (which I will discuss in detail, so skip this paragraph if you must) feels wrong. Certainly, Bond was bound to lose his life sooner or later. You can only save the world from supervillains for so long before one of them gets the best of you. But the climactic scenes inï¿½No Time to Dieï¿½feel undeserving. Malekï¿½s scenery-chewing performance as Lyutsifer finds him pontificating about how he and Bond are both heroes marked by the past. Thereï¿½s a scuffle, and Lyutsifer scratches Bond with a cracked vial of blood. He has been infected with nanobots that will infect Madeline and Mathilde if they come in contact with Bond. So he resolves to remain on the island, where British missiles will detonate Lyutsiferï¿½s nanobot farm. Thereï¿½s a teary goodbye via earpiece radio, and there endeth James Bond, leaving his lover and daughter to live with nothing more than a memory. Itï¿½s a fitting end in some respects. Bond had to go eventually, right? But couldnï¿½t he just retire from service, the way Connery, Moore, and Brosnan did? While contemplating how preferable aï¿½happily ever afterï¿½ending mightï¿½ve beenï¿½with Bond and his newfound brood playing on an isolated beach somewhere in the Caribbean, perhapsï¿½consider a plot hole that may have saved our hero. When Q (Ben Whishaw, delightful as ever) gives Bond a watch that can release an EMP, the 007 uses the pulse to detonate a bionic eye inside a henchmanï¿½s head. So why canï¿½t Bond use the same pulse to neutralize nanobots? After all, theyï¿½re microscopic machines, right? And if that wouldnï¿½t work, couldnï¿½t Q cookï¿½somethingï¿½up in the lab? In any case, the movieï¿½s rules concerning this EMP are wildly inconsistent. At one point, Bond opens several electronic locks with his EMP, but it somehow doesnï¿½t affect his radio earpiece. Although quibbles of this nature are best left to fanboy forums, the point is that the ending feels unearned and sloppy. The writers are more interested in propelling Bond to his demise than crafting a situation that feels like Bondï¿½s death is necessary. Whatï¿½s next, then? Perhaps itï¿½s another origin story on par withï¿½Casino Royale. James Bond seems to be taking the path of Batman and Spider-Man, where every few years the studios will start over with a new actor. a new timeline. But more than thatï¿½and this is the banality of itï¿½they will doubtlessly retell his origin story and create a new Bondverse. Of course, James Bonds have come and gone over the years, but they rarely had beginnings or endingsï¿½not to the extent of Craigï¿½s version, anyway. Earlier films did not build a universe in the manner of the MCU. It was unclear if Mooreï¿½s Bond had experienced everything Conneryï¿½s had, and that never mattered before. But general audiences today may expect a more connected cinematic universe, which makes Bond somehow more temporary.ï¿½No Time to Dieï¿½certainly proves heï¿½s mortal. Will the same be true of the franchise? Itï¿½s both rewarding to see Craigï¿½s version receive some finality but also grating to think that we might be introduced to another new recruit in a few years. That feels like a minor betrayal of what Bond fans have come to expect over six decades of mantle passing.""",VVD_Doc3_NoTimeToDie,VVD,Action,Positive,No Time to Die
124,VVD_Doc4_NoTimeToDie,"""The James Bond franchise is legendary, but it certainly has its peaks and valleys. Each Bond era brings a different style. Six actors have played the iconic character over the course of 25 movies. Daniel Craig's casting was initially met with backlash, but the 2006 masterpieceï¿½Casino Royaleï¿½proved a lot of people wrong.ï¿½No Time to Dieï¿½is Craig's fifth and final time starring in the role. Two of the entries in Craig's era are disappointing, butï¿½No Time to Dieï¿½doesn't joinï¿½Quantum of Solaceï¿½andï¿½Spectreï¿½on that list. No Time to Dieï¿½opens on a house in a snow-covered landscape. A masked assailant descends upon the poor inhabitants to hunt down a specific target. The introduction plays out like a horror movie, including a home invasion and a creepy-masked killer. However, the movie quickly changes gears as Bond and Madeleine (Lï¿½a Seydoux) live their days together. The spy discovers that there's a lot he doesn't know about her past. Now, it's coming back to haunt them. Their volatile relationship is at the center ofï¿½No Time to Die. Madeleine was previously introduced, but she's given a much stronger identity here. However, the focus doesn't shift from Bond. No Time to Dieï¿½is abundantly aware of the fact that this is Craig's final outing. It seeks to tie up the loose ends on this iteration of Bond in the most respectful ways possible. The screenplay successfully adds more depth to the character by emphasizing both his internal and external struggles. The womanizer spy is much more focused on monogamy and has difficulty trusting any of the women in his life after Madeleine. Meanwhile, he's remained off the grid and hasn't been in the field in quite some time. Bond is brought back into the spotlight that opens up old wounds and forces him to face the demons that he's been hiding from for years. The consequences could result in countless lives being lost around the world. During Bond's time away from the field, a lot has changed. For example, Nomi (Lashana Lynch) has taken the codename """"007,' who also has the cool confidence that Bond lost years ago. Another character is brought into the fold named Paloma (Ana de Armas). Both of these ladies are absolute badasses. However, their stories aren't at the forefront. In fact, de Armas has essentially a glorified cameo that will have audiences demanding a Paloma spinoff. She delivers such immense personality and fun during her brief presence that is sure to stick with viewers. Meanwhile, Nomi gets a little bit of extra screen time, allowing the character to exhibit a small amount of growth. Some other characters reprise their roles, but make no mistake that this is Craig's journey. Everybody else is simply along for the ride.Rami Malek stars as the antagonist. His mask gives him a creepy aesthetic, but that's the most that can be said about him. He's certainly the least interesting antagonist in Craig's Bond era. However,ï¿½No Time to Dieï¿½doesn't aim for this to lead to another sequel. This villain isn't meant to have a greater narrative that the audience is concerned about, so he mostly exists as a repeated plot device for Bond. No Time to Dieï¿½has a sentimental side to it. At its core, Craig's final installment tells a story about forgiveness. It's a theme that runs deep. All of the characters have been wronged to various degrees, but are now being faced with the option of forgiveness.ï¿½No Time to Dieï¿½concludes in a way that is totally respectful of Craig's iteration of Bond and the story he's been telling since 2006. Director Cary Joji Fukunaga does a wonderful job tying up Bond's story in a way that feels complete. The performances are stellar all around, particularly from Craig and Seydoux. No Time to Dieï¿½will likely garner awards attention for its use of sound. The action hits particularly hard with its use of audio, elevating the movie's most thrilling moments. However, it's one of the less visually eye-catching installments.ï¿½Skyfallï¿½remains the most gorgeous of Craig's Bond movies. Nevertheless,ï¿½No Time to Dieï¿½is a theater experience through and through. It makes sense why the studio waited to release it without having to dump the big release on a streaming service. See it on the biggest, loudest screen you can safely experience it on. No Time to Dieï¿½is utterly cinematic. It's strong storytelling with big action set pieces that will leave you breathless. It's not perfect and it once again twists the Bond formula, but it's a lovely send-off for Craig. Earlier this year,ï¿½Black Widowï¿½had its send-off for Scarlett Johansson, but the movie was more concerned with developing its ensemble cast for future Marvel installments. Meanwhile,ï¿½No Time to Dieï¿½set its sights on giving Craig's Bond era the goodbye it deserves.""",VVD_Doc4_NoTimeToDie,VVD,Action,Positive,No Time to Die
125,VVD_Doc5_NoTimeToDie,"""Due to the pandemic, we had to wait a few years longer for the final Daniel Craig as James Bond film. Did that lead to heightened expectations that the film could never have lived up to? Maybe. Or is it just a case of fans never going to be happy with his final Bond film no matter what? Who can say? What I can say with a certain amount of certainty is that this is definitely not the strongest of the Craig/Bond films.Back in 2006 film fans were introduced to the latest James Bond. He was another British actor in the form of Daniel Craig. In the beginning I am sure many thought it a strange choice. While Craig was a big star on star he had not yet made a name for himself on film having just had smallish roles in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and Elizabeth. But he quieted critics with a great turn in his debut Bond film, Casino Royale. His was a different Bond. Less debonair with his shorter, stockier frame and blonde hair and blue eyes. He also brought to screen a colder James Bond.ï¿½2021 brought the last of his putting on the tuxedo and spitting out the one liners while saving the world as 007 films. No Time to Die is directed and co-written by Cari Joji Fukunaga (Jane Eyre ï¿½ 2011 and televisionï¿½s True Detective), which is quite a departure for him. Nothing in his IMDB director roster would indicate he was prepared to take on such an action heavy and large scale film.ï¿½Bond. James Bond (Daniel Craig). Has retired from being Englandï¿½s 007 and is traveling the world with the woman he loves. James and Madeleine (Lea Seydoux ï¿½ Blue is the Warmest Color, Spectre) are in Italy. Love and warm sunshine are in the air. Between all the romance, Madeleine has convinced James to release himself from the guilt he feels about Vesper Lyndï¿½s death by going to visit her grave. While there he is pulled back into his former life in the blink of an eye.Or more accurately, in the time of a single explosion. He has survived but is being pursued by killers. James believes that Madeleine has betrayed him. This leads him to turning away the woman he loves and returning to his life ofï¿½tuxedos, gunfights, narrowly escaping death, beautiful women, and saving the world.ï¿½James is back working with his old CIA friend Felix (Jeffrey Wright ï¿½ from televisionï¿½s Westworld) and exchanging barbs with M (Ralph Fiennes ï¿½ Schindlerï¿½s List, The Grand Budapest Hotel), using gadgets devised by Q (Ben Whishaw ï¿½ Paddington 2, The Danish Girl), being worried about by Moneypenny (Naomie Harris ï¿½ Skyfall, Moonlight), battling the bad guys with a beautiful woman (Ana de Armas ï¿½ Knives Out, Blade Runner 2049) as well as foiling the elaborate plans of baddies like Safin (Rami Malek ï¿½ Bohemian Rhapsody, Dolittle) and old Spectre foe, Blofeld (Christoph Waltz ï¿½ The French Dispatch, Alita: Battle Angel).ï¿½Right off the bat, this is no Casino Royale or Skyfall. But it is better than Quantum of Solace and Spectre. So it sits firmly in the middle in regards to quality of Daniel Craig as James Bond films. We all wanted Craig to go out if blaze of glory, but that is not the case. Why? Well, there are a couple of reasons. But mostly because they seem to have forgotten all the things which made millions fans of James Bond movies.ï¿½Yes, old foes Spectre are back, but that is not enough. While Blofeld was a cool enemy, Safin is no way near as scary or worthy enough. I do not fault Rami Malek for this, though he rather stylized way of speaking is grating at times. This is the fault of the director/script. The main bad guy really plays a rather small role here. Plus we are never really given a reason as to why he is attempting to kill millions. Adds up to a rather paper thin and non intimidating bad guy. In James Bond films there has been a long tradition of delightful baddies. Safin will not go down as one.ï¿½Most of the film is spent getting up close and personal with James Bond. Like we never have before. Seems almost like a different character as a result. Not sure we needed to know what Bond is feeling. I donï¿½t think we even need to know that Bond has feelings. Not necessary with this character.ï¿½I know this was Craigï¿½s goodbye but did it really have to be 2 hours and 43 minutes? Way too long! A serious turn in editing room is in order. Things needed to be tightened up. Too long even for the biggest of Bond fans. You know this is going to be a bit bloaty when it takes about 30 minutes to get to the opening credits. Yikes!This was not a bad film. Just not exactly the one I had hoped for.""",VVD_Doc5_NoTimeToDie,VVD,Action,Positive,No Time to Die
126,VVD_Doc6_NoTimeToDie,"""In almost every James Bond film our hero prevents a psychotic supervillain from realising his dream of world domination. For the makers of these movies world domination is an ambition fulfilled a long time ago. The trick nowadays is to maintain their iron grip on the hearts and minds of the viewing public.For a franchise that began in 1962, which has now clocked up its 25thï¿½entry, the most difficult moments arrive when new actors are introduced to take on the roles of familiar, beloved characters. Some of these characters have been replaced several times over, including the central figure of Secret Agent 007. Sean Connery, the original Bond, who appeared in the role officially on six occasions is still widely regarded as the best. Roger Moore would make seven appearances, and Pierce Brosnan four.Aussie George Lazenby made only one film as James Bond before leaving of his own volition. Timothy Dalton quit after two movies and has hardly been heard of since. With five appearances spread out over 15 years Daniel Craig has played Bond for a longer period than any other actor, imprinting his image on the minds of a generation of viewers ï¿½ viewers conditioned by social media to have the shortest attention spans in history.So when Craig announces that the new Bond,ï¿½No Time to Die, will be his last, it sets up a huge buzz of speculation. Will they kill him off? Will they reveal a successor? And for the actor himself, is there life after James Bond? One suspects heï¿½ll come through more successfully than Lazenby or Dalton.The knowledge that this will be Craigï¿½s last fling exerts an influence on the way the plot unfolds, and the way we view the film. Itï¿½s not an entirely happy influence because it makes the action seem more than usually mechanical, and allows little scope for other characters to develop convincing personalities.Over an epic span of 163 minutes, director Cary Joji Fukunaga has given us a fast-moving entertainment that wonï¿½t disappoint the majority of fans, but itï¿½s one of the most dramatically uninvolving of Bond movies. The story is all about planet James, with everyone else relegated to the role of satellites. Because this planet is on an inexorable trajectory towards oblivion, every sequence plays out as one more step on the path to the final revelation of Bondï¿½s fate ï¿½ which is easy enough to predict long before the credits roll.This feeling sets in gradually as the film progresses. The pre-titles sequence is spectacular, beginning with a creepy flashback to Madeleine Swanï¿½s childhood, as her snow-bound family chalet is invaded by a crazed killer. Next weï¿½re with Bond and Madeleine (Lï¿½a Seydoux), on holiday in the picturesque Italian town of Matera, where they are waylaid by a group of murderous villains. By the time the reliably amazing titles appear, weï¿½re on the edge of our seats. As the story progresses we slide back into the comfy chair.Suddenly itï¿½s five years later, and Bond is pursuing his lonely retirement in a villa in Jamaica. Even though the plots of these films ï¿½ being so relentlessly formulaic ï¿½ tend to disappear quickly from my mind, I had a sense ofï¿½dï¿½jï¿½ vu. Havenï¿½t we already been down this path inï¿½Skyfallï¿½(2021), with Bond retired from the service living in a secluded semi-wilderness? When being lured back from retirement becomes a standard plot device itï¿½s clear why Craig felt it was time to call it a day.Itï¿½s worth pausing to note that viewers are expected to know who Madeleine Swann is, and a whole lot of other stuff in Jamesï¿½s backstory, which suggests that the Bond films are being visualised as a sequence rather than as stand-alones. Weï¿½ve seen this in the never-ending succession of Marvel and DC superhero flicks made for diehard fans with an insatiable appetite for sequels.Madeleine was introduced in the previous film,ï¿½Spectreï¿½(2015), and has progressed to the point where she is the new light of Bondï¿½s life. We are expected to see the liaison of James and Madeleine as a tragic love story, but they spend so much time apart that thereï¿½s no romance, no electricity, in this relationship. Indeed, Bond often seems more attached to his old comrades in the service.Following a raid on a top-secret laboratory in which the villains steal a deadly biological weapon, Bond is contacted by his CIA friend, Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), to help recover the goods. This leads to some inevitable mayhem at a party in Havana, given by the criminal gang, Spectre, that Bond infiltrates in company with a new character named Paloma (Ana de Armas). She turns out to be one of the few bright sparks in this industrially-produced story, but her entry and exit are brief.Another new character who looks set to hang around, is Nomi (Lashana Lynch), a brassy young black woman who has been given Bondï¿½s old designation of 007. Immediately it seems as if the future of the franchise has been revealed: the new 007 will be black and female! But is it really possible? Could a woman be the same kind of practised seducer as Bond and get away with it?The filmmakers appear to be testing the waters. While Nomi will get a rousing cheer from the PC brigade this is not the standard demographic for Bond audiences who have traditionally favoured the same old blend of hyper-masculinity, dry wit and aggression. If Nomi were locked in as the next Bond she might have commanded a bigger, more prominent role inï¿½No Time to Die. Instead, she is hardly more than a supporting character, missing from most of the big scenes. She is a tease rather than a certainty.Christoph Waltzï¿½s Blofeld is still in the mix as a supervillain, even while imprisoned in a maximum security cell in London, but he is not Bondï¿½s major nemesis. That distinction belongs to Rami Malek, as the wonderfully named Lyutsifer Safin, who has his own complex backstory and the kind of Count Dracula accent that isï¿½de rigueurï¿½for Bond baddies. The same applies to the nasty scientist, Dr. Obruchev (David Dencik), who also seems to have taken elocution lessons in Transylvania. Itï¿½s nice to know some things never change.With a James Bond movie whatï¿½s important for most viewers is not the story, but the unchanging recipe of car and motorbike chases; gun fights and martial arts contests; seductions; explosions; split-second escapes; gizmos and gadgets; and the moment when 007 says: ï¿½Bond, James Bondï¿½.ï¿½No Time to Dieï¿½has all of the above, but not much else.There is a small nod to the present state of the world in the dreaded super weapon being a biological agent designed to target a particular personï¿½s DNA and spread on close contact. In the fantastic, exaggerated Bond universe this vision of a world overcome by a viral menace felt almost comforting in its plausibility.""",VVD_Doc6_NoTimeToDie,VVD,Action,Negative,No Time to Die
127,VVD_Doc7_NoTimeToDie,"""Over 24 movies, James Bond has faced off against hitmen, lasers, collapsing buildings, murderous molars, golden guns, gravity, alligators, sharks, snakes, swords, nukes and the weaponization of the literal sun. Movie No. 25, the long-awaited ï¿½No Time To Die,ï¿½ sees MI6ï¿½s most valuable asset clashing for the first time with culmination, that grand all-roads-have-led-to-this drop of the curtain weï¿½ve come to expect thanks to Batman, Rey and Tony Stark. Thereï¿½s no pinpointing when over the last 15 years ï¿½ the longest span of time any actor has beared the license to kill ï¿½ this run of 007 missions decided it was telling a not-entirely-cohesive interconnected story of cold-blooded angst amid the epic parkour chases and frantic shootouts, but ï¿½No Time To Dieï¿½ does its bloated best to pay off the pivot from tradition.Directed to frazzled, ambitious life by Cary Joji Fukunaga, the result is a grand affair befitting the shoddy arc this phase of the Bond franchise fashioned out of its glamour and gunfire. But in its forceful attempts to expand the scope of this runï¿½s sincerity as well as its spectacle, Craigï¿½s finale doesnï¿½t feel like itï¿½s coming full circle so much as arriving at inevitable destinations, beckoned there by a bleary-eyed script overanxious to satisfy the widest swath of moviegoers. ï¿½No Time To Dieï¿½ arrives six years after ï¿½Spectre,ï¿½ a movie of misbegotten construction but peppered with intriguing metatextual wrinkles which time has revealed, and while this may not be the worst of the Craig-era Bond flicks, it is the most redundant. When the smoke of its many explosions subsides, we find a film operating less by its own ethos than the familiar trajectory blockbuster movies have taken since this double-oh tallied his first official kills in 2006.Speaking of explosions, the first doesnï¿½t come until about 20 minutes into ï¿½No Time To Die,ï¿½ a noticeable and purposeful delay propelling Bond out of yet another sunny retirement with Lea Seydouxï¿½s Madeleine Swann, returning an unconvincing romantic dynamic from ï¿½Spectre.ï¿½ He looks to be at peace, his cold heart defrosted by Italian sunshine and Madeleineï¿½s insistence that he visit the local cemetery to heal the wounds he suffered the last time he was swallowed up by love in Venice. Thereï¿½s a nagging, slightly frustrating suspicion that Bond should know better than to trust the solitude. Sure enough, the guardrails go back up as heï¿½s yanked into another story of layered revenge and deceit. Where ï¿½No Time To Dieï¿½ deviates from formulas both recent and traditional is in its placement of Bond in his own story. The core delight of these movies lies in watching 007 keep up with foes who are constantly one step ahead of him, in entering the shadows not knowing what traps or betrayals lie in wait. In ï¿½No Time To Die,ï¿½ the enemies are behind him, and gaining fast (despite a five-year time jump hastened along by Billie Eilishï¿½s melancholic anthem). SPECTRE has ostensibly returned, and itï¿½s by CIA agent Felix Leiterï¿½s hand (Jeffrey Wright reprises the role) that Bond finds himself in the role of savior once again. Resurrection isnï¿½t a new idea for Craigï¿½s Bond, nor is his pushback against irrelevance. But irrelevance, in addition to being a motivating force, can also be a great equalizer, and here it appears in the form of Nomi (Lashana Lynch), a smooth operator who has succeeded Bond as the new 007. Is that a glint of self-righteousness we spot in his eye? Suddenly he seems a bit nimbler while spearheading a CIA operation to extract an informant in Cuba before MI6 can, and this stellar early sequence ï¿½ anchored by what amounts to a cameo by a sensational Ana de Armas as a green operative barely able to disguise her glee at being in the field ï¿½ represents ï¿½No Time To Dieï¿½ at its most balanced, harmonizing the thrills of well-paced action with the novelty and implications of Bondï¿½s role-reversal.The apocalyptic stakes are more foregrounded than ever before in the Craig canon, which is just to say Bond and Co. are fighting for the immediate fate of the world rather than merely disrupting business between terrorists or contending with personal vendettas. Nanobots and DNA-targeting are invoked as a bioterroristic scheme unfurls, but ï¿½No Time To Dieï¿½ knows better than to impart any actual importance to them beyond shepherding the movie from beat to beat, from the stark glance of revelations discovered to massive final-act arenas Ken Burns would be proud of. But over the course of that journey, intriguing ideas tend to be pigeonholed into disparate dynamics and comedic gags. Reunions with returning MI6ers Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and Q (Ben Wishaw) donï¿½t carry the same climatic air that they did in ï¿½Skyfall,ï¿½ and the movieï¿½s insistence to round out the story of a character introduced in ï¿½Spectreï¿½ results in a dramatic spark which fades before it has a chance to ignite a new blaze of pathos neither Connery, nor Moore, nor Brosnan ever saw their emotional journeys guided by. ï¿½No Time To Dieï¿½ is a Bond movie thatï¿½s got air in its lungs, but struggles to stay in tune with itself. Thereï¿½s too much slack in its dramatic stakes. At their best, the Craig movies have encouraged deeper analysis of an action-movie archetype previously defined by the spyï¿½s wit, womanizing and canny ability to weasel himself out of any brush with death (the new lens is not unlike the one Christopher Nolan applied to Batman a year before ï¿½Casino Royaleï¿½ arrived). At multiple junctures in ï¿½No Time To Dieï¿½ Bond is called out for being outdated, thematically synching the movie up with the ache of tragedy continuing to simmer under Craigï¿½s eyes ï¿½ as distinct a trademark as anything in the actorï¿½s time on her majestyï¿½s secret service ï¿½ but the potency of that accusation wilts away elsewhere when heï¿½s shown to have achieved a near-mythic status with his peers. The threat of anonymity doesnï¿½t seem quite so clear when heï¿½s shown to have literal fans in this entry.This is a movie of moments, not momentum; of potent elements scattered in their application. Despite the bursts of satisfaction which flare up in the pseudo-rivalry between Bond and Nomi (a rivalry whose grip might be stronger in a movie with reshuffled priorities) or an atmospheric showdown which finds Bond playing bullfighter to roaring mechanical steers, the dominant sensation, regrettably, is limpness. How else to explain how the third act seems to defibrillate the proceedings back to life when our hero hurtles to the movieï¿½s final arena? Itï¿½s here where heï¿½ll finally meet the person whom the movieï¿½s marketing would have you think is our villain ï¿½ Rami Malekï¿½s Lyutsifer Safin, speaking in a low rumble and high capacity for boredom ï¿½ but who really represents another living, breathing hall of mirrors. What is there left for Craigï¿½s agent to contend with, having gone through more personal anguish than all the previous Bonds combined? A sort-of standoff which suppresses the quiet existentialism the actor suffused the character with, as it turns out, and a dispiriting affirmation that this scriptï¿½s preferred method of cementing his legacy is by tripping over its own uncertainty that the best of these recent movies havenï¿½t already cemented a legacy of their own.Befitting his characterï¿½s resilience, Craig is too good not to grant his Bond a sheen of poignancy when it matters most. The landscape of the blockbuster action movie has changed a great deal since his introduction in the Bush era, and in the age of tights and capes and superpowers his ability to hang a clever line over the edge of bittersweetness still plays like gangbusters. ï¿½No Time To Die,ï¿½ in a cheeky move, is bookended by two home invasions so antithetical in scope and consequence that they practically occupy different genres altogether. Itï¿½s one of Craigï¿½s superhuman feats of acting in this series that he was able to so stylishly split the difference of the various contradictions these movies have thrown his way, right to the very end.""",VVD_Doc7_NoTimeToDie,VVD,Action,Negative,No Time to Die
128,VVD_Doc8_NoTimeToDie,"""Iï¿½ve written elsewhere about the reasons that I sat down in a sour state of mind to the swan song of the Daniel Craig James Bond movies, No Time to Die, but whatï¿½s the actual film like itself? The Craig years have been a bumpy ride; the promising but bloated Casino Royale, the paper-thin Quantum of Solace, the all-time high of Skyfall, the messy doldrums of Spectre, and finally No Time To Die. The problem, as with Star Wars and most other franchises is, the longer it goes on, the more you realise that theyï¿½re just making it up as they go along. Things start brightly with some retconning; weï¿½re introduced to previous relationship Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux) and as soon as she blurts out ï¿½thereï¿½s something Iï¿½ve been meaning to tell you,ï¿½ we know that sheï¿½s pregnant and that Bond now has a daughter and a family to protect. This protect-your-family motivation is contrary to Bond lore, but it helps that the notion is cannily dropped in the middle of a stylish Aston Martin chase through an ancient Italian town; the disguise just about sugar-coats the contradictions. A second set piece, a fire-fight in a Santiago night-club for Blofeldï¿½s birthday party, also lands well, but things start to fall apart with the introduction of the new young, black and gifted female OO7 (Lashana Lynch); James Bond has retired after all. Over an hour of inane, static chat then follow without Bond even picking up a gun; we eventually unite Bond with his family in Scotland, but off-the-shelf baddie Safin (Rami Malek) is still waiting on his island lair with plans to annihilate the world, and all that dark foreshadowing canï¿½t really go for nothing. No Time to Die canï¿½t really be faulted for the action scenes, which are terse, well-realised and technically superb. But the key element of humour is missing; Phoebe Waller-Bridge was drafted in to pep the script up, but sophistication is MIA, with gags that would elicit groans in the Roger Moore era. The new 007 drops down onto a dance-floor, shoots an assailant and quips ï¿½Mind if I cut in?ï¿½ Cringe. Even the serious-minded Skyfall stooped to double-taking underground passengers for cheap laughs, but the tired one-liners here take away from the big reveal; spoiler alerts, James Bond finally gets killed. That should be a big deal for a 20th century icon, but after besting so many adversaries, to see Bond bite the bullet at the hands of a no-mark villain who cuts around in his dressing gown is a whopping anti-climax. And itï¿½s painful listening to the new and old 007 squabbling about who should have the title; they sound like toddlers in a playground, but the familiar punchline is that the uppity woman gets slapped down. Thanks, Phoebe Waller-Bridge. Ana de Armas achieves far more for women in her memorable ten minute turn, but alas, her character is ignored for the rest of the film.Craig has proved himself as a great James Bond, and probably deserved an encore; itï¿½s just a shame that No Time To Die has no idea what the greatest hits should be, and the actor seems bored with the role. Craig joined the franchise at a time when films were still planned one by one, and the lack of any over-arcing direction scuppers any sense of continuity over his five movies. Oddities like a cameo from Gromit the dog, or Bond mentioning The Book of Mormon, feel like something of a stretch for an out-dated character whose claim to wokeness seems to be that his friends are all black. Cary J Fukunaga seems to have been doing the best he can with a salvage job here, and thereï¿½s a nice choice of Jack London quote to finish, but no action film can ingest a full hour without any action to speak of. The final James Bond Will Return caption feels more like a threat than a promise unless his producers can find a valid reason for him to do so.""",VVD_Doc8_NoTimeToDie,VVD,Action,Negative,No Time to Die
129,VVD_Doc9_NoTimeToDie,"""James Bond (Daniel Craig) retires to Jamaica after an acrimonious break-up with Madeleine (Lï¿½a Seydoux) in Italy. Some years later though, he is dragged back into action when a British bioweapon falls into the wrong hands. The much-delayedï¿½No Time to Die, the 25th film in theï¿½Bond saga, undoes some of the damage of Sam Mendesï¿½ mediocreï¿½Spectre, and does at least find some sort of logical end-result for the personalisation of Bond that has been the thread of this quintet of films starring Daniel Craig. Not that I agree with this humanisation and sentimentality, but hopefully the filmï¿½s ending has finally put this iteration to bed, and will return Bond to theï¿½faceless, ultra-professional cipherï¿½best incarnated by Sean Connery in the finest run of the series. _Probably the strongest element to the film is its change of director. By the end ofï¿½Spectre, Sam Mendesï¿½ middlebrow, second-hand, clichï¿½d realisation of Bond really was becoming rather stale. Cary Joji Fukunaga films the best action sequences in the recent movies (at least since as far back asï¿½Casino Royale), and the first half of the film is generally very strong ï¿½ from the opening section in Matera, to Bondï¿½s recruitment by the CIA in Jamaica and the subsequent mission in Cuba. And, of course, this also represents the swansong of Daniel Craig in the role, and though Iï¿½ve become increasingly agnostic about his Bond filmsï¿½ reverence for all things origin and interconnected, thereï¿½s no questioning the gravitas and dramatic plausibility of his character. Itï¿½s a world away from the ludicrousness of the panto Bonds of Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan, and for that we should be grateful. No Time toï¿½Dieï¿½s main area where it suffers is in having one of the weakest villains and conspiracies in the history of the saga. Targeted DNA by remotely controlling nanobots is farcical, and Rami Malek, as the ultimate baddie (someone who in this filmï¿½s hierarchy of dastardliness is meant to outdo Blofeld), simply isnï¿½t a good enough actor to draw you into his characterï¿½s psychopathology. Heï¿½s not an especially convincing line-reader and he is unable to project a depth or intensity behind the eyes. Thereï¿½s a possibility he was pitching for a preening, slightly effeminate tyrant ï¿½ la Joaquin Phoenixï¿½s Commodus inï¿½Gladiator, but Malek doesnï¿½t possess even 10% of Phoenixï¿½s screen magnetism and ability to convey inner torment. And while weï¿½re on about unconvincing characterisations, please, no more cod-Russian accents from non-native speakers in a Bond movie. With Malek and David Dencikï¿½s defecting scientist, we are almost back in the hammy territory of Alan Cummingï¿½s Boris inï¿½GoldenEyeï¿½or even a Borat!ï¿½(November 2021)The Daniel Craig 007 era comes to a merciful close with this punishingly overlong and predominantly ineffective entry that marks an obvious low point for the venerable series, with the hopelessly bloated narrative following James Bond (Craig) as he attempts to prevent a terrorist (Rami Malekï¿½s Lyutsifer Safin) from unleashing a deadly bioweapon on millions of people. Filmmaker Cary Joji Fukunaga, working from a script written with Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, kicksï¿½No Time to Dieï¿½off with what just might be the franchiseï¿½s weakest, least interesting pre-credits opening to date (and this is to say nothing of Billie Eilishï¿½s thoroughly forgettable theme song), with the movie subsequently progressing into an exceedingly sluggish and uninvolving midsection thatï¿½s practically overflowing with aggressively questionable elements. (This is especially true of Lashana Lynchï¿½s grating, needlessly caustic work as Bondï¿½s MI6 replacement.) The far-from-enthralling vibe is compounded, to put it mildly, by Craigï¿½s frustratingly lifeless and ambivalent portrayal of the pictureï¿½s iconic central character (ie in his hands, Bond is portrayed as absurdly sullen and melancholic), while Malek transforms what shouldï¿½ve been a gleefully over-the-top supervillain into the seriesï¿½ most muted and subdued antagonist (ie Safin is justï¿½boring, generally speaking). And although the film admittedly contains a small handful of engaging interludes, including an almost incongruously entertaining mid-movie car chase,ï¿½No Time to Dieï¿½ultimately arrives at a tedious and downright endless third act that ensures the whole thing concludes on as anticlimactic and underwhelming a note as one couldï¿½ve possibly envisioned ï¿½ which, when coupled with the misguided twist that closes the proceedings, cements the movieï¿½s place as a completely misbegotten endeavor that fails as both a Bond flickï¿½andï¿½an expensive blockbuster.""",VVD_Doc9_NoTimeToDie,VVD,Action,Negative,No Time to Die
130,VVD_Doc10_NoTimeToDie,"""Do you know that awful feeling when you anticipate something (in this case, a film) forï¿½soï¿½long, only to end up with a bitter disappointment? Well, thatï¿½s exactly how I felt after I watchedï¿½No Time to Die. Seriously, even after the end credits roll, I was sitting there in the dark and kept wondering why the long-awaited and of course, long-delayed Daniel Craig-era Bond film doesnï¿½t turn out as good as I really wanted it to be. I mean, given the calibre of Cary Joji Fukunaga, who made such a lasting impression in the first season of HBOï¿½sï¿½True Detective, I figure heï¿½s the right man for the job even after the original director Danny Boyle bailed out due to creative differences.Itï¿½s not thatï¿½No Time to Dieï¿½is entirely a letdown because the film does get off to a promising start. This includes the extended pre-credits sequence detailing a violent flashback and later, the Matera-set chase involving a motorcycle (the incredible bike jump still wowed me on the big screen even after seeing that scene being heavily promoted in numerous trailers) and a souped-up Aston Martin DB5, complete with Gatling guns and smokescreen.For a while there, it was a well-paced series of taut and escalating moments, with the exception of Cary Joji Fukunagaï¿½s penchant for shooting the action setpieces using lots of fast camera movements and editing that feels like he canï¿½t wait to move on to the next scene. In other words, for all the supposedly exciting moments that occurred on the screen, he doesnï¿½t let us sink in and fully enjoy the elaborate choreography. Besides, whatï¿½s the point of spending so much money (a whopping US$250 million!) with one of them used extensively for practical stunts if the film ends up being shot in an incomprehensible way?Not to mention Cary Joji Fukunaga also botches the opportunity to elevate these scenes more cinematic sinceï¿½No Time to Dieï¿½earns its distinction as the first Bond film to be partially shot with IMAX film cameras. Itï¿½s like how Michael Bay ruined the chance for making good use of IMAX film cameras when he shot them inï¿½Transformers: The Last Knight. The only significant difference between Fukunaga and Bay is that the latter did it a lot worse with his messed-up shaky-cam approach.Following the Matera-set chase set pieces, subsequent action sequences are mostly a hit-and-miss affair, with the shootout in Cuba and the elaborate moment in the foggy forest are worth mentioning here. The former features Ana de Armas as Bondï¿½s contact, Paloma and she certainly knows how to make an entrance in a stunning evening gown. She even brings a refreshingly cheeky and fun personality to her otherwise typical Bond girl persona and also proves to be an expert in martial arts and handling guns. If thatï¿½s not enough, she shares good chemistry with Daniel Craigï¿½s Bond (they previously collaborated in 2019ï¿½sï¿½Knives Out) while the whole Cuba scene brings an overall energetic vibe to a film that is mostly sullen and dead-serious.Some other action sequences, however, do not really work out as well as I thought. Case in point includes the underwhelming final third act and even though it includes a would-be memorable moment shot in a single take (something that Cary Joji Fukunaga was already good at inï¿½True Detective), his decision to film it using a handheld camera instead of a smooth, Steadicam-style somehow diluted the excitement. Now, for the plot: One should know thatï¿½No Time to Dieï¿½is a direct sequel to 2015ï¿½sï¿½Spectreï¿½(that means itï¿½s not a good idea to watch this as a standalone Bond film because the Daniel Craig-era of James Bond is one interconnected cinematic universe stretching all the way back to 2006ï¿½sï¿½Casino Royale). When we last meet Bond and his lover, Madeleine Swann (Lï¿½a Seydoux) at the end ofï¿½Spectre, we see them leaving together in an Aston Martin DB5. They are now having the time of their lives in Matera, Italy but it doesnï¿½t take long before the past catches up with them.Long story short, Bond learns that Swann is hiding something and he ends up living off the grid somewhere in Jamaica for five years. During those years where he is completely absent from active duty, his superior M (Ralph Fiennes) has since appointed Nomi (Lashana Lynch), an MI6 agent as the new 007. But Bond is back in action when his old friend, CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) wanted his help for a mission to locate a kidnapped scientist named Valdo Obruchev (David Dencik). The mission, in turn, has something to do with the mysterious Safin (Rami Malek) and a deadly new bioweapon.Cary Joji Fukunaga, who also co-wrote the screenplay alongside Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, try so hard to tie up whatever loose ends left in the past four Bond films while bringing in a significant new character. That new character in question is Safin played by Rami Malek. Roping in an Oscar winner (he won Best Actor for his role as the late Freddie Mercury in 2018ï¿½sï¿½Bohemian Rhapsody) is a nice touch and I figure Rami Malek can pull off a memorable villain.Too bad thatï¿½s not the case because his character feels more likeï¿½ an afterthought. He may have the creepy look, complete with a heavily-scarred face but the appearance alone isnï¿½t enough to offset his lack of character development. We learn little about his so-called tragic backstory and even his motivation related to everyone involved and his plan to use the new bioweapon technology is as superficial as it comes.It doesnï¿½t help either when Bond doesnï¿½t really interact with him until much later in the film and even by then, itï¿½s all too little and too late. The film doesnï¿½t forget Christoph Waltzï¿½s Blofeld, who is previously seen inï¿½Spectreï¿½but instead of making good use of his appearance, itï¿½s a pity that heï¿½s wasted here. It was as if Cary Joji Fukunaga simply did everyone (fans of Waltzï¿½s Blofeld, that is) a favour by adding him as mere fan service but hardly bother to give him anything substantial to work with.Then, thereï¿½s the introduction of a new 007 agent in the form of Nomi played by Lashana Lynch. Her no-nonsense portrayal could have been useful if the story gives her something significant to make her character worthwhile. But like Christoph Waltzï¿½s Blofeld, she too is wasted and her role is equivalent to a window dressing. Whatï¿½s even worse is the lack of chemistry between her and Bond. Speaking of the latter, I was perhaps among the minorities who actually thought Daniel Craig and Lï¿½a Seydouxï¿½s on-screen chemistry inï¿½Spectre. But inï¿½No Time to Die, I was surprised to see their chemistry is almost non-existent. Itï¿½s more like watching these two attractive couple looking all great on the big screen but little else matters when comes to delving into their characters deeper.Cary Joji Fukunaga isnï¿½t just content in giving us a typical Bond film as he also desperately wanted to subvert our expectations, particularly during the second half. While adding in something new would be a refreshing change of pace if done right, the second half of the film grows increasingly (and unnecessarily) convoluted and even murky in some moments.Apart from the promising pre-credits opening sequence,ï¿½No Time to Dieï¿½has some good production values and Hans Zimmerï¿½s riveting score, where he combines new musical composition with familiar Bond themes is equally praiseworthy.As for the cast, Daniel Craig delivers a typically engaging performance in his fifth and final role as James Bond. Itï¿½s just too bad the story doesnï¿½t justify all the sufferings that his character is forced to go through. The aforementioned Ana de Armas as Paloma is among the best things that ever happened in this film while Ben Whishaw and Naomie Harris, both respectively reprising Q and Moneypenny provide decent supports in their otherwise underwritten roles.Well, so much for the would-be memorable send-off for the Daniel Craig-era of Bond films. Perhaps Cary Joji Fukunaga gets too ambitious to handle such an epic scope navigating the existing and new plot threads connected to the previous Bond films. The nearly three-hour length, the longest film ever seen in the history of the Bond franchise would have worked better with a shorter runtime (maybe around 130 minutes). And a tighter edit too, where they could have done without introducing Rami Malekï¿½s Safin and his whole story connected to Blofeld and yes, even Madeleine Swann in the first place. Not especially how the story mishandled his character arc.""",VVD_Doc10_NoTimeToDie,VVD,Action,Negative,No Time to Die
131,JGJ_Doc1_Taxi,"""Bringing Down the House notwithstanding, Queen Latifah is usually fun to watch. Fun-loving but no-nonsense, she has a way of seeming like the sanest presence onscreen ï¿½ sheï¿½s up there reacting to the movie along with us. She drifts through Taxi more or less unscathed, rubbing her familiar persona up against that of Jimmy Fallon, who specializes, here as on Saturday Night Live, in boyish naï¿½vete. As the inept New York detective Washburn, who canï¿½t drive a car without disaster, Fallon manages some mild amusement ï¿½ I enjoyed the way he handles whatï¿½s left of his badge after someone has taken a blowtorch to it. He and Latifah fall into a predictable dynamic ï¿½ he does something stupid, she rolls her eyes and delivers some variation on ï¿½Crazy-ass white people.ï¿½Latifahï¿½s character ï¿½ Belle, a cabbie with a cartoonishly souped-up car ï¿½ at one point diagnoses Washburnï¿½s problem: ï¿½You try too hard.ï¿½ The same canï¿½t be said of Taxi, a laid-back, inoffensive time-waster that doesnï¿½t even try to make Gisele Bï¿½ndchen look like a guy. Bï¿½ndchen, the Brazilian supermodel, plays Vanessa, a Brazilian supermodel type who leads three other lookers on various bank robberies, disguising herself with a mustache. At least the first Charlieï¿½s Angels came up with some unnervingly male make-up for Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore in their crossdressing scene, but never mind. The movie has a touching faith in mustaches as an all-purpose disguise; Washburn also wears one when going undercover as a Cuban thief. Surprisingly, Queen Latifah doesnï¿½t get one. Taxi is a remake of a French action-comedy smash hit (it has spawned two sequels) written by Luc Besson (The Professional), who gets a producing credit here. Fans of the original have cried ï¿½Sacrilege!ï¿½, as if this were a remake of Last Year at Marienbad starring Adam Sandler and Missy Elliott, but I daresay the French film is too high-concept to be considered violable by Hollywood. (Hell, I preferred the American remake Point of No Return to Bessonï¿½s own La Femme Nikita.) As directed by Tim Story (Fantastic Four), this Taxi is fast and amiable idiocy, never stopping long enough for us to dwell on such questions as how Jennifer Esposito could possibly be a New York City police lieutenant or how Ann-Margret, as Washburnï¿½s mom, stays upright after her fourth or fifth margarita. One thing struck me as odd: Despite what youï¿½ve seen in the trailers ï¿½ Queen Latifah blowing a kiss at Gisele Bï¿½ndchen and delivering an impressed ï¿½Damn!ï¿½ when the supermodel thieves disrobe ï¿½ her character is steadfastly hetero, with a neglected boyfriend (Henry Simmons) who shuffles around the movieï¿½s margins waiting for her to show up. Why would the trailer set Belle up as a lesbian when nothing could be further from the movieï¿½s reality? (In the movie, her ï¿½Damn!ï¿½ is in response to the villainsï¿½ speedy work behind the wheel.) In any event, admirers of Sapphic subtexts wonï¿½t totally be let down, as thereï¿½s a gratuitous scene where Bï¿½ndchen frisks Esposito while a bunch of copsï¿½ jaws hit the pavement. Taxi is a standard buddy movie right down to the floor, in which the two temperamentally opposed protagonists learn to respect each other grudgingly, though without the romantic/sexual tension you might expect of a male/female team-up. Itï¿½s a summer movie unaccountably marooned in October, when weï¿½re supposed to start getting more adult fare. If you want a more substantive film concerning four female robbers and starring Queen Latifah, nowï¿½s the time for me to point you towards 1996ï¿½s Set It Off; if you want a funnier film involving a ï¿½Weekend Updateï¿½ anchor, go rent Tina Feyï¿½s Mean Girls; if you want this same material probably done with more panache, you could do worse than the original French Taxi, if your DVD player can handle discs from other countries.

She then turned up in a few films (Scary Movie 3, Barbershop 2, and The Cookout, which she also produced) in cameo roles. Now she's back in a star vehicle along with a comedian ready to break out on his own. Jimmy Fallon has been known to many as a member of NBC's Saturday Night Live and now he's starring with a well known actor/comedian/singer. Together, the two of them star in """"Taxi"""", a film that has plenty of action, laughs, and sex appeal. While the film has the look of a clichï¿½ buddy movie, Latifah and Fallon bring in their own flair of comedic skills to make a difference and take you on a New York joyride. Set in New York City, Belle (Queen Latifah) is a speed freak, in the vehicle sense. Initially a bike messenger, she takes pride in that she can run her errands in record fashion. When her time comes, she quits that job and gets her taxi driver license. On the eve of her first day of work, she fixes her yellow cab with some installments rather than spend time with her boyfriend (Simmons). Andy Washburn (Fallon) is a bumbling cop trying to make a big case stick. He's also a terrible driver. When his skills behind the wheel crashes into a food market and lets some criminals escape, his boss, Lt. Marta Robbins (Esposito) isn't pleased as she confiscates his license to drive. When some models from Brazil, led by Vanessa (Bundchen), fly into the city begin robbing banks, Andy sees this as his opportunity to redeem himself. Convincing Belle to help him out, Andy has no idea what he's in stored when he gets in her car. Belle can get anywhere in record time, but sometimes that works against her when dealing with beautiful criminals. While some of the jokes don't make everyone laugh, there are enough to keep you entertained. Queen Latifah takes the lead and flies with it. Her chemistry with Fallon isn't always on point but as the film moves on, it develops. Fallon, in his lead role, is somewhat bland as a comic. Some of his humor works and some don't. The clichï¿½ scene were the two of them start talking about their lives is dull and has no pay off. What works are the action scenes involving the cars. Let's face it, when the film is called Taxi, and plot involves a heist, folks want to see more action than drama. In her first film as an Gisele Bundchen is adequate portraying a model from Brazil. Not a big stretch here, but at least she didn't foolish. If the film is a success, maybe more demanding role are forthcoming. Director Tim Story has thrown some clever stunts for all to enjoy. The scene-stealer of the film would have to be Ann-Margaret. Who knew this actress has comedic chops within her acting skills. Henry Simmons, in trying to create a name for himself since NYPD Blue will end next year, is okay as the boyfriend. It's a useless role, but a good one for him.

133,JGJ_Doc3_Taxi,"""Hollywood certainly does not, testament to this would be the 2004 hideous rehash involving Queen Latifa and some Swedish orientated girls performing the heist. The reason why the remake is so damned awful, is that Americans do not understand the subtlties of European humour, failing to realise that slap stick and obvious ploys to get women dressed in next to nothing do not work, nor does the ebonical slang that haunts many a film, spoken from stereotypical aggressive blacks. Anywho...I don't own many comedy films in the film collection, often the formula is repetitive, and certain films can only be endured a handful of times before coming tiresome, and placed in the back of ones collection to gather dust, to be left there until the time comes when DVD's are replaced by something else all together. Taxi, however, is a severely enjoyable romp, which I can find myself watching on a frequent basis as the film is just so damned entertaining. A Luc Besson script, but not directed by him, presents us with our two main characters, Daniel the greatest pizza delivery boy turned Taxi Driver, and Emilien the most bumbling police officer since Inspector Gadget. The humour is grand, and the difference between the two is highlighted from the very beginning. Daniel is the smooth charmer, from which the humour associated with him comes at the expense of those around him, whilst Emilien is the source of all the gags he provides due to his nature as a complete incompetent (this highlighted brilliantly in the scene where he is learning to drive). But do not let this fool you Emilien is a hard working honest man, and he is in no way handicapped, bar possibly his attempts of trying """"too"""" hard. The humour is understated which truly makes this one of the greats. Everything is done so stylish and classily, there are no gigantic slapstick moments, or moments of humour based of vulgarities, the humour is exactly what humour should be, quick witted dialogue combined with precarious """"sit-com""""-esque moments.

So the chase is on, and using Daniels modified Peugeot they formulate a plan to trap the krauts (""""damn the special franco-German relationship""""). This is truly a must for any fan of cinema. On a random note, I noticed one IMDb critic commented on the futility of the """"joint-smoking"""" scene with Emilien and Daniel. Obviously the lad is American as marijuana is heavily frowned upon there (but you can drive a death trap at 16), but it merely symbolises their close net relationship, and how friendship is more important to the both of them, as the police officer can over look it, and indulge in this treat with Daniel. This is a rip roaring comedy which will have you in stitches come its unexpected finale, it certainly is one of the greatest pay-offs in film history, and if you don't agree, well I guess you can just stick that in your pipe and smoke it then, can't you?!""",JGJ_Doc3_Taxi,JGJ,Action,Positive,Taxi
134,JGJ_Doc4_Taxi,"""How one likes """"Taxi"""" has everything to do with how one responds to the hapless cop character, played by Jimmy Fallon.

He's not a lovable idiot, or a funny idiot, but an idiot as one might find in life -- struggling to assert himself and swinging wildly from diffidence to dangerous decisiveness without a moment's warning. It's a role that could make Fallon come across, in the eyes of some viewers, as a little on the irritating side, but still, the character is interesting and believable as more than a comic construction. Real laughs come in pairing this hapless but determined fellow with Queen Latifah, who brings to """"Taxi"""" her usual warmth and brass and skepticism. This time, Latifah plays the comic straight man, and she's good at it. In comic terms, she's much better cast as the immovable object than as the irresistible impulse (""""Bringing Down the House"""").

Washburn (Fallon) is an undercover cop whose career has been hampered by the fact that he's a terrible driver. Chasing crooks in an early scene, he leaves his car in reverse and takes out a building.The inevitable meeting comes when the cop, relieved of his driver's license, hears a police call for a bank robbery only two blocks away. He hops into Belle's cab and has her drive him to the scene. After the robbers get away, circumstances throw the cop and the cabdriver together, and they start trying to find the bank robbers, independent of a police and FBI investigation. Things go by so quickly in """"Taxi"""" that it's almost possible not to notice that Belle really has no compelling reason to pursue the bank robbers or spend time with our hero. But inevitably one does notice this, and from then on one can't stop noticing. Likewise, the viewer will notice that, even though the movie is about driving, the car chases (of which there are several) are lackluster and fairly unconvincing. In a few shots, the cars don't even seem to be going fast, and the driving moves are prosaic. However, there may be a good side to this. Director Tim Story's heart is not in the chase scenes. He is much more interested in conversation scenes that showcase extreme personalities. In one of those, the cop takes the driver to his mother's house -- and the mother (Ann-Margret) turns out to be a cheerful, eccentric, raging drunk. The scene matches the tone of Story's film """"Barbershop,"""" where the peripheral characters are parodies or distortions of recognizable archetypes.

To watch this film is to imagine this genre on the endangered species list. This movie is not only lacking in humor. It is also lacking in reality. ï¿½Taxiï¿½ makes absolutely no sense at all. It is a remake of the 1998 French film by the same title. It must be a huge disappointment for Queen Latifa fans. She has appeared in some very likeable roles. Jimmy Fallon is also an extremely poor excuse for the traditional bumbling cop routine. Where is the next generation of Peter Sellers? It just seems like most of the talent borrowed from ï¿½Saturday Night Liveï¿½ cannot exist beyond a 10-minute sketch. You not only have to check your brain at the door, but also all reason. I could go on and on and on and tell you how unfunny this movie is, but I think you already get the idea. One of the primary plot points in this flic is several chase scenes. The film is set in Manhattan, but most of the chases were shot in LA. I know that Hollywood does this all the time, but at least they could have changed the street signs. That is just plain sloppy! Letï¿½s break down the rest of the story. Officer Andy Washburn (Jimmy Fallon) has just wrecked his third police car and killed a parrot. His precinct boss (Jennifer Esposito) is so tough that she takes his drivers license away. I guess that you canï¿½t use a taxi unless this tragic event happens. He also would never have discovered the privately owned customized taxi. Fast-talking Fallon and the conceited Belle (Latifa) never do click in this flic. Donï¿½t put all the blame on the Queen. I donï¿½t think anyone would have clicked with Fallon. She does seem to find herself lately in clichï¿½d ethnic roles. You know the ones that are desperately trying to help all the uptight whites. I know that director Tim Story has found some success with the movie ï¿½Barbershop.ï¿½ This time around the block is just too choreographed. What Mr. Story lacks in humor, he tries to make up some ground by tossing in some sexy bank robbers. The most recognized is the Brazilian Victoria Secret fashion model Gisele Bundchen. That fact cannot make up for an abrupt ending that does help to put disappointed moviegoers out of their misery. The language and lust factor are just a few of the additional spoilers in this film. My VERY strong recommendation is to skip this one. There is great hope for Christian comedy. I recently saw Paul Aldrich. He is hilarious. You can read and hear more about him at www.paulaldrich.com. I will be reviewing his new comedy release soon.""",JGJ_Doc5_Taxi,JGJ,Action,Positive,Taxi
136,JGJ_Doc6_Taxi,"""Washburn is an undercover cop who, after yet another job ending in a crashed car, has his license taken away and put back on the street. Meanwhile cycle courier Belle has finally gotten her taxi license and is preparing her souped up vehicle for the New York City streets. When a bank robbery in progress is called in, Washburn commandeers Belle's cab and gets involved in a high-speed chase with a group of Brazilian supermodels in a red BMW. Thrown off the case by the FBI, Washburn wants to catch the gang to get his job back, while Belle agrees to help so that she can get her taxi out of lockup. I quite liked the original for what it was so I decided to give this film a try to see if it could manage to be fun. I'll be honest and say that the trailer attracted me because it had car chases, a bit of a laugh and some faux-lesbian teasing ï¿½ there, gone are my 'art-house' credentials! I hoped that these elements could be kept fun and that the film could have a spark to it in some area that would raise it above the genre and actually make it fun to watch. Sadly I was wrong and my worries about the effort put into this film were realized in the first few minutes of the film where a skinny person on a bike is revealed to be Belle ï¿½ even though their body shapes could not be more different! With this lack of attention to detail I did not have high hopes but I figured I was being picky and tried to get past it. However from here on in everything is exactly as you would expect ï¿½ lacking imagination and effort in almost every regard. The plot is nonsense but to pick on that is to be too demanding because none of us expected anything too cohesive or logical but suffice to say that attempts to build stories around the characters are all flat and uninteresting. However what I did need from the film was action, excitement, comedy and spark. The action is OK but nothing special ï¿½ the use of CGI cars to make impossible stunts really takes away from the impact of the action, while the limitations of the busy streets means that the car chases are very tightly cut and never feel real and impressive. This reduces how excited the audience can feel and me and the other 15 people in the cinema sat rather impassive for most of the action scenes. With this OK, then the comedy needed to match it to produce an OK film, but it didn't. Not at all. The comedy is partly based on that wonderful comic device ï¿½ that black people are cool and sassy while white people are geeky and uptight. Oh, how I never tire of seeing racial stereotypes enforced in the name of comedy. With this old chestnut wheeled out again, the rest of the comedy falls into line and I never really laughed more than once. The button pushing and lack of imagination continues with the robbers themselves who are nothing more than legs and skin who are there to attract an idiotic and salivating male audience (ie ï¿½ me) on the promise of titillation. They don't deliver this very well at all and the scenes where they try to feel cheap, tacky and exploitative instead of sexy and fresh. The cast are lumbered with the material but they don't do as much as perhaps they could have done to make it better. Fallon is annoying and geeky ï¿½ simply filling the 'white' clichï¿½ in the 'cool black/geeky white' combo. Latifah continues to just play the easy ethnic clichï¿½ stuff for every penny. I don't know if she is like this in real life but I must admit that I do find her ethnic clichï¿½ to be lazy and rather offensive ï¿½ her smart-mouth, impatience and speed to violence has been in many of her last few roles and I don't think it is the best use of her position, but then again if you put money in front of me then I'd probably do the same. Esposito is pretty wasted in a thankless role before being used as a piece of meat for the sake of selling the film to the male audience (yes, yes, I admit it). The models are nothing but eye candy and I didn't think they did it very well. Overall this is not a terrible film because it will appeal to boys and young teenagers with its noisy mix of unattainable leggy women, fast cars, basic humour and racial stereotyping; the target audience for this is shown even in the cut ï¿½ which removes a use of the MF word so that it can get to a younger audience. For me though I found it lacking any sort of imagination, spark or wit and instead just took the easy line of clichï¿½, stereotype and noise. It will appeal to some, but not to me, and it was an effort to get to the end.""",JGJ_Doc6_Taxi,JGJ,Action,Negative,Taxi
137,JGJ_Doc7_Taxi,"""Jimmy Fallon's big screen career may be over before it even gets startedif his complete lack of screen presence in Taxi is anyindication. The comedian, who was a hoot as Tina Fey's news co-anchor on """"Saturday Night Live"""" but left the sketch show this season to pursue movie stardom, is virtually invisible next to the charismatic Queen Latifah, Ann-Margret and Jennifer Esposito in this low-watt action-comedy -- and when he's alone in the frame, you may find yourself just looking at the scenery. Fallon plays a wholly inept cop with such a bad record of wrecking cars that his frustrated lieutenant (Esposito) takes away his driver's license. Desperate to prove himself when he hears a bank heist reported over his police radio, he commandeers a taxi driven by takes-no-sass Latifah -- who, it just so happens, has customized her seemingly average cab into a presto-change-o supercharged street rod. It's the perfect car, with the perfect daredevil driver, for chasing down the crooks -- who are, purely for the sake of selling tickets to 13-year-old boys, leggy Brazilian models in a souped-up BMW. None of these asinine plot devices (which are just the tip of the iceberg) would matter if the film embraced its own absurdity, focusing on irony and over-the-top action. But the stunt-driving is almost as lackluster as the picture's star (and over-edited to hide this fact), and director Tim Story (Barbershop) stops the plot dead in its tracks for comedy set pieces, as when Fallon sings along in a falsetto to Natalie Cole's """"This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)."""" Based on a French action-comedy from writer Luc Besson (The Fifth Element, The Transporter), who also produced this remake, Taxi is so weakly scripted that it gives us no reason to invest in Fallon's redemption for his complete failure as a cop, or to care about Latifah's cursory attempts at explaining to her pouting hunk of a boyfriend why she hasn't come home for the fancy dinner he's cooked. And Story apparently cares little about suspension of disbelief because the film is plagued by distractingly obvious blue-screen effects and nearly as obvious stunt doubles. The guy (I'm reasonably sure it's a guy) who is supposed to be Latifah during the opening scene, in which she supposedly bicycles through Manhattan traffic at break-neck speeds, is at least 30 pounds lighter than the zaftig actress. Not needing a double for the humor, Latifah becomes the film's lead by default, with her spitfire sense of tough-girl comedy timing. But Taxi's scene-stealer (if not its saving grace) is Ann-Margret, hilariously loopy as Fallon's sweet but permanently buzzed, margarita-mixing mother, whose apron strings he still clings to rather pathetically. As for the fledgling star, he's not a complete failure as an actor -- in fact he was terrific in his small role as a corporate-stooge band manager in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous. But while Taxi is certainly full of faults that would be hard for most good actors to overcome, Fallon provides the fatal blow himself by being the least interesting part of a pretty paltry movie. Then again, at least it's not the kind of over-extended sketch movie usually used to launch the failing film careers of """"SNL"""" alumni.""",JGJ_Doc7_Taxi,JGJ,Action,Negative,Taxi
138,JGJ_Doc8_Taxi,"""Gï¿½rard Pirï¿½s' 1998 film Taxi seems to have been more inspirational than it deserves to have been, with three sequels since its inception; a woeful 2004 American remake plus, from what I've read, an Indian film named Dhoom which supposedly somewhat borrows from the overall narrative of Taxi. The film isn't a crushing disappointment, but for an 86 minute sprint to still feel like it outstays its welcome is not good, and the film is not the achievement everyone else seems to think it is. Penned by Luc Besson, he now of innumerable Americanised, rather daft French language films about not very much, the film is nothing more than an afterthought; a screenplay pumped out over the course of a month and sufficing on basic technical levels of kinetic action and would-be funny buddy genre banter. It's over the top and rather annoying. Taxi tells the story of a well off job-wise but clumsy, down and out cop named ï¿½milien (Diefenthal) and a relatively poor, working class cab driver named Daniel (Naceri) who's actually at the top of his game in his own little world. The two come together when cop ï¿½milien hitches a ride in Daniel's cab but books him for haring down the roads at a dangerous speed. Forced into working for the police in taking down some German bank-robbers through threat of a license ban, Daniel must subside into aiding. The distinction between the police and your average working French schlub is more prominent than needs be in Taxi, with most of the police officers or figures of authority in Taxi coming across as either woefully incompetent; easily duped or just generally somewhat pathetic ï¿½ it ranges from inept traffic cops, to stupid SWAT team members to blundering, elderly police captains. Indeed, taxi driver Daniel goes on at length at how he dislikes the police and enjoys insulting those that have signed up as well as taunting those who control speed traps. In stark comparison, Daniel is the young go-getter; with a car; girlfriend in Lilly (an early role for Marion Cotillard - the stuff you've got to star in to catch a break, eh?) and a place of his own he calls home. Whatever problems to do with the strange relationship France seem to have going on between youth and state still manages to worm its way into what is, on the surface, harmless and daft entertainment. No surprise then, that the youth turns out to be more qualified to do the task of going after these criminals than the state are. The film likes these characters, enjoys having them goad the enemy and have them banter to one another about whatever; but it likes the cars even more ï¿½ so much so in fact, that the process of transforming a bog-standard Peugeot into a souped-up and ready for action juggernaut is a process of distinct fetishistic transition: as Daniel goes through all the motions of flipping a buttoned turntable; raising the suspension; unveiling a spoiler; pushing out a bumper; the removing of one steering wheel and then the glorious re-attachment of another. A running joke is that Daniel finds time for a very small amount of foreplay with his girlfriend Lilly without ever actually following through with sex; his frustrations relieved by going through a set of familiar motions with his car before rampaging off at top speed, this after completing the transformation of the phallic automobile from natural and as you see it, into something else capable of maximum drive. It is in stark contrast to ï¿½milien, who it is enforced early on cannot drive at all when he smashes into a shop front during a test, but this twinned with the fact he still lives at home; does not have a girlfriend, a trait that is enforced through repeated failed attempts to 'woo' female police officer Petra (Wiklund), and generally maintains an odd relationship with his mother, one ingredient of which sees her make snacks for him to take on his journeys. The reason all this is playing out is due to the aforementioned German bank robbers, a laughing; cackling; mocking; technically efficient; mostly Aryan group of thieves whom have robbed banks across mainland Europe and now target France. This plot device is obviously absolute nonsense, as there's no reason French SWAT teams cannot surround a bank which is in the process of being robbed and apprehend them. The bringing in of a nationalistic drive the French 'ought' to possess when the police chief mentions the Second World War is unnecessary, France being next in the firing line following banks in Holland and Belgium, two nations that were occupied as well as Italy whom were allied with Germany during The War, having already been invaded and robbed. Taxi's clear attempt to appeal to audiences of an overseas nature is evident in all the crashing and shooting and chasing, for sure; but its guiltiest example is when Daniel, who begins with a pizza delivery job but promotes himself to position of a cab driver, takes his first fare home after they've spent a day at the shops. The moment when we see a baguette roll sticking out of one of their shopping bags is sure to force those of an observant nature to roll eyes. Taxi looks at fighting fire with fire in utilising Daniel to help catch the thieves; I think we come to like the rouge driver that-is Daniel by the end, and want him to get away with escaping with his licence intact, but there's nothing really going on around him to get involved in and the chases are pretty unexciting as a whole - Taxi isn't a disaster, it's dumb B-movie fun which will work for some, but isn't really good enough on the whole.""",JGJ_Doc8_Taxi,JGJ,Action,Negative,Taxi
139,JGJ_Doc9_Taxi,"""I'm actually old enough that when I hear the word 'Taxi' as a title I think first of the melancholy Harry Chapin song, a wonderful piece of music; maybe with a little reflection, I conjure up the seventies sitcom of the same name. Perhaps the makers of this new film were hoping for some of that association to rub off on people and lure them in, because if a movie is titled what it's really about, this one should have been called 'Chasing four hot chicks who can't speak English.' The plot of Taxi follows Detective Washburn (Jimmy Fallon, making his debut as a movie lead) and bike-messenger-turned-cab-driver Belle (Queen Latifah) as they inadvertently get tangled up with one another and have to figure out who is ripping off a series of Manhattan banks and try to catch them. Rounding out the cast (no pun intended) are Jennifer Esposito (you might remember her from Spin City) as Washburn's lieutenant, Marta, and supermodel Gisele Bundchen as the head hot chick. I knew I was in trouble when I saw 'based on a script by Luc Besson,' because, while I like some of Besson's material, he hasn't done a good movie since 'Fifth Element' and that was a while ago now. I haven't seen his version of this movie, but I'm betting it's nearly as maladroit as this one. Much of the problem stems from the casting. Fallon, while a funny performer, is just out of place as a dorky, inept bumbler; it's as if he's trying to channel Inspector Clouseau half the time. Having him be a little green is one thing; but he's a walking mess, unable to do anything right, and it gets irritating quickly. Latifah, by contrast, is comfortable in her role, and she's a lot more enjoyable, but it's really hard to accept her as a bike messenger, especially after the lengthy stunt/title sequence they begin the movie with (one of the funniest gags in the movie, unintentionally of course, is watching a bike messenger do all this zany stuff and then having him pull off his helmet at the end of the sequence only to reveal Latifah. Come on, we're just not that naï¿½ve). Esposito isn't too bad, but she's only given the standard 'angry cop lieutenant' clichï¿½ to work with, and even she can't make it work (and she seems a tad young to be a lieutenant, but that's another story). Only two people are really right for their roles: Bundchen and Ann Margaret, who plays Fallon's lush of a mother. Her scenes are kept short and punchy, and she's really effective and funny. Bundchen doesn't have to do much but look good in incredibly brief outfits, sort of what she does for a living anyway, but she has screen presence and in her limited role she works well enough (and has inhumanly long legs, but that's beside the point). She has just enough sass to pull off the role. Taxi has a few honest belly laughs, but by and large it's not really that good. The car chases are mildly exciting, but they aren't eye-popping like, say, Matrix 2, just your garden variety screaming around the streets of New York. Taxi isn't a very good film, but it isn't embarrassingly bad either. With some better casting (and some better writing, particularly on Fallon's character) the movie could have been a lot funnier. Pity it isn't.""",JGJ_Doc9_Taxi,JGJ,Action,Negative,Taxi
140,JGJ_Doc10_Taxi,"""Queen Latifah handily walked away with the show in Chicago. She enlivened the uneven Bringing Down the House. Her scenes in Barbershop 2 were among the filmï¿½s highlights. So what is it with her and these steaming piles of donkey crap like The Cookout and the dreadfully unfunny, unexciting, uninspired and occasionally offensive Taxi? I have to confess that I took a little nap during the middle stretch of the film, but that may be the only reason Iï¿½m willing to give it a half-star edge over Hilary Duffï¿½s vehicle of destruction, Raise Your Voice. Taxi was at least more restful, but in its own way, it may actually be a worse movie, since it wastes not only Queen Latifah, but also the rightly legendary Ann-Margret. If youï¿½ve seen the filmï¿½s lackluster trailer ï¿½ complete with the bewhiskered tag line, ï¿½Heï¿½s armed, but sheï¿½s dangerousï¿½ ï¿½ youï¿½ve seen the film. All youï¿½ve missed is 95 minutes of padding. Iï¿½ve never seen the original French film (also produced by Luc Besson), but Iï¿½m hard-pressed to imagine that this three-course turkey dinner isnï¿½t considerably worse. And if the U.S. version spawns two sequels (as its French counterpart did), itï¿½ll be proof that Hollywood filmmaking has sunk to new levels of desperation. The story line is weak to start with. Fallon stars as the worldï¿½s stupidest cop, who also happens to also be the worldï¿½s worst driver. So when his driverï¿½s license is snatched (why not his badge?), he finds himself taking newbie taxi driver Queen Latifahï¿½s improbably souped-up cab to a robbery. We already know what a badass of the road the Queen is. Sheï¿½s even hell on wheels with a bicycle, suggests the movie, which opens with her ï¿½ or, more correctly, her 30-pounds-lighter stunt double ï¿½ zipping through Manhattan on her last day as a bike messenger. Soon after that, we see her scaring the life out of a hapless passenger in one of her first taxi jobs. ï¿½Buckle up for safety, motherï¿½ï¿½ she tells the client ï¿½ interrupted by a quick cut to squealing tires so as to keep that PG-13 rating. Not surprisingly, once she hooks up with the blander than bland Fallon, Latifa proves to be a better detective than he is. One of those improbable odd-couple buddy-bondings ensues (you wonder why I nodded off?). I suppose this kind of bubble-headed froth could have been mildly entertaining, but absolutely none of it works, thanks in no small part to Fallon and the character heï¿½s been given. Beyond being unfunny and unappealing, heï¿½s so lame and stupid that heï¿½s actively annoying. And I donï¿½t see him as much of a box-office draw. More than two or three ï¿½hotï¿½ Saturday Night Live veterans have learned the hard way that what ï¿½ and who ï¿½ people will watch for free at home doesnï¿½t translate into what ï¿½ and who ï¿½ they will actually pay money to see. Based on this film, Iï¿½d say Fallon is not likely to become the next Chevy Chase or Bill Murray, and probably not even the next Dana Carvey. The next Julia Sweeney might be nearer the mark. Taxi might not quite be in the Itï¿½s Pat league of awfulness, but when it calls on Fallon to do a Natalie Cole impression, itï¿½s not too far off. Fallon is not the only fly in the ointment, though. Latifah simply coasts on her personality, and while director Tim Story may have scored big with Barbershop, heï¿½s utterly off-key here. Even though Iï¿½d readily concede that no one much cares about chase/crash action scenes anymore ï¿½ what can possibly be shown that hasnï¿½t been shown by now? ï¿½ the ones in Taxi are among the most inept Iï¿½ve ever seen. The ridiculous and badly done pileup featured in the trailer is typical of the action scenes throughout the entire movie. The blame for this could perhaps fall on the shoulders of second-unit director Brian Smrz, but considering that his credits in this capacity include X 2, there must be some other hand at work, too. The real kicker is the screenplay by Ben Garant, Thomas Lennon (both of TVï¿½s Reno 911!) and Jim Kouf (Snow Dogs). It is not only unfunny, itï¿½s generally dreadful. Guys, this is 2004, and by now we ought to be way past the idea that alcoholism is a laff riot. In addition, itï¿½s utterly degrading have an actress of Ann-Margretï¿½s caliber play a ï¿½funnyï¿½ alcoholic. Everyone involved in this movie seems in need of a lesson in when to stop. Taxi reaches its predictable climax a good five minutes before the movie finally takes pity on the audience and ends, thanks to an interminable scene of Latifah as a fledgling NASCAR driver (complete with a cameo by Jeff Gordon, who shows all the acting skills he brings to his Coca-Cola ads). If you absolutely must see this movie, be sure you follow it up with another look at Chicago and remind yourself what Queen Latifah can do."",Make sure that every review/document has at least 500 words",JGJ_Doc10_Taxi,JGJ,Action,Negative,Taxi
141,HKF_Doc1_Taken,"""In a world of James Bonds, Jason Bournes, and Frank Martins, it's hard for a little random ex-spy named Brian Mills to get some love. On the surface, his film seems a little formulaic, and he seems a little...well...old. However, once we get into Mills's story, and see how infinitely badass the wonderful Liam Neeson plays him, you'll probably be saying something along the lines of """"James who?"""". 'Taken', which follows Mills as he pursues those responsible for kidnapping his daughter, is a heart pounding thriller with a stupendous display of badassery from Liam Neeson. It may have a plot that's sort of unbelievable, but it's one of the best action thrillers in years. Why do critics dislike this movie? Is it because they have no ability to see beyond the obviously far-fetched events of the movie? Is it because they take themselves too seriously and don't know how to have fun? It's probably both of those two reasons, but I find peace in thinking that they're complete idiots who don't know what they're talking about...sometimes. The fact remains that 'Taken' is plain fun, popcorn entertainment, that doesn't resort to cheap explosions in looking for thrills. It relies on the gritty closeups of the marvelous hand to hand combat and stylistic action (Liam Neeson's 'Batman Begins' training certainly paid off here). The film is the brainchild of Luc Besson, the mind behind the Transporter films. Here, he relies on a director that may be inexperienced as a director, but one who also has more experience in shooting action on film than most. Pierre Morel, responsible for the photography in action films such as 'War', 'Unleashed', and of course, 'The Transporter', does a great job in choreographing some very good action sequences, especially giving them some flavor when they end. The film was not just pure action, which was good, as it also showed Neeson's character working as a spy and shows some intelligence in that aspect. Speaking of Neeson, it appears that his days as the kind hearted mentor figure in films such as 'Narnia' and 'Star Wars' are behind him. His ruthless, badass, and perfectly natural performance makes the movie watchable and carries it from start to finish (which isn't too long, as the film clocks in at one hour and 45 minutes including previews). Neeson is a veteran, and it really shows. His performance goes deep, and will excite the viewer in all ways. Maggie Grace was also noteworthy as his daughter (it was tough to recognize her without her blonde hair!). This is probably the best example I've seen in awhile of how stupid and self-righteous most film critics can be. They fault 'Taken' for having events occur that aren't entirely realistic. Do they recognize the film for being a great roller coaster ride that will leave most viewers happy (pretty much my entire theater of 150 people seemed happy)? No. It's further proof that Liam Neeson is one of the best leading men around, and that these critics really need to catch up with the times.""",HKF_Doc1_Taken,HKF,Action,Positive,Taken
142,HKF_Doc2_Taken,"""It's been just too long waiting for an action thriller that will knock my socks off, given too many bland attempts that left me wondering if the genre is too tired for my liking, with nothing left to wow. Then comes the Europa Corp team of Pierre Morel directing a Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen story, and Taken now ranks as one of my contemporary favourites for its simple story executed with so much style and gripping pace, that you'll be left breathless by the time the end credits roll. The trailer had one of the best monologues that I'm sure would have put many in the theatres, and probably be representative of the film. You have a stoic looking Liam Neeson as a father who tells the stranger at the end of the other line the conditions that the game will be played in, with perhaps bluff calling against bluff, only for the challenge and gauntlet to be thrown. From then on it's a non-stop adrenaline rush because this daddy happens to be a top ex-covert operative for the US government, so the bad guys essentially have chosen a wrong opponent to play the game with. The story worked well in dipping into some familiar fears, where daddy's little girl Kim (Maggie Grace) tells her dad lie after lie so as to cover up her tracks in wanting to do things she knows he would disapprove of. Such as, in this case, going on a tour of museums in Paris supposedly, rather than letting him know of her intent of being a groupie with friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy) chasing U2 all over Europe. Some may dismiss this fear as paranoia, but I think that heightened sense of awareness is a by product occupational hazard, and it's always better to err on the side of caution. For any parent who are confident of their kid's conduct, there is absolutely no guarantees that their kids' friends would toe the same line, and there are often those who are magnets for trouble due to their thrill seeking. As is in this case where you see supposed safeguards to lower risks being systematically peeled away. With his reluctant consent and lessons being thrown in on very simple survival tips (that would even serve well in real life), things still go wrong according to Murphy, and Liam Neeson's Brian has to race against time in finding a needle in the perennial haystack, relying on contacts and skills built over the years in carrying out government missions of prevention to save masses, now to put them into something more personal when addressing what could be any parent's worst nightmare, in having their daughters sold to the sex slave trade. Action-wise, Morel employs a whole host of fights ranging from gun battles, knives and the good ol' fisticuffs, with Neeson employing some cool Shinsai Goshin Kai moves for close quarter combats to take out opponents. You might balk at how it's probably another one man army movie with the hero ripping through the streets of Paris, but this borders close to the Jason Bourne movies in the way opponents are dispatched without remorse and without much bullshit. It's clinical as it is deadly, just the way I suppose anyone would do so without the very hokey monologues that plague lesser films prior to each kill. The action direction was top notch without resorting to cheap MTV styled quick cuts, and had kept the shaky-cam syndrome at bay, which in turn provided for a pure adrenaline rush for action junkies out there. Taken well deserved its accolades and I say again, one of the best action thrillers to have hit the screen of late after a number of bland peers. I highly recommend this and it's a shoo-in as a contender for top films of this year. See if you can spot that SQ plane flying overhead in a scene too!""",HKF_Doc2_Taken,HKF,Action,Positive,Taken
143,HKF_Doc3_Taken,"""""""Taken"""" was the action movie of 2008. The first reason why it was an ultimately great movie is because it was the type of movie that kept you on the edge and you just could not take your eyes away from the movie theatre screen. Also, the actors that were starring in the movie did a great job of luring the people in and basically did a fantabulous job in the acting its self. Therefore, they picked out a great location for the movie I mean who does not love Paris, France it's marvelousness, but it shows that it can also be a dangerous place. For example, storyline that the director Pierre Morel put together for this movie was great because it kept you wanting to know what going to happen next. Furthermore, when you have a a bunch of people like just so drawn into the movie you have done a great job. I know that when I was watching it with my parents I was like on the edge of my seat just anxious to to what is going to happen in the end it is a great action movie. Also they did great on keeping it action and not go from action to like horror movie. I find that it's a bit harder to find good action movies because people do not always do great stunts but they did great at making a really good action movie like jumping off roofs and throwing like grenades,and shooting wars. Especially, the actors did great with acting you define toy got the feeling were as the were like in the actual situation and not just acting out for fun. Now a days people don't really take pride in there work to really strive do do a great job. But Bryan Mills ( Liam Nesson) did great a being not only be a dad but a great agent. Kim (Maggie Grace) who is actually born the same day as me did great at being the girl who was taken by the French gang men did great as being anxious and wanting to get out and did an abundantly high pitched scream in the movie about four or five times if I were her my throat would of hurt right away. Additionally, Lenore ( Famke Janseen) the lady who plays Brian's ex-wife and Kim's mom you could see that she really had the motherly instinct in her when """"her daughter"""" was taken she really would do anything to get her back to safety. In the end all the actors in the movie did an enormously exravagant job in this movie probably there best of all time. On the other hand, most parents might not approve of the film because of how there is kidnapping but its apart of the world and its function. Kidnapping is not a great thing but its what makes the movie the movie because that's were you get the action of the movie because the dad wants his daughter back and the get into a whole gun fit. The leader of the groups son gets killed and the leader wants revenge over Brian for killing his son. In other ways I can kind of see way parents don't want there hidden to see it. But they can go to the movies themselves and watch it and they will not have to worry about all the bad things that are going to happen during the beginning middle part of the movie. There is a solution to there there worries. In addition, who ever picks the location for this movie did a outstanding job because who does not live Paris.Th all the old buildings and highways available they did great the buildings were old look and when you would see them jumping off the roofs it was really cool because there are many different sized buildings and they would get stuck in the close lines because many people there live in apartments and air dry there clothing. Although, it's in Paris and is an action you can still get to see a little bit of Paris it self and and what it has to offer for movies. Nevertheless, Why not watch """"Taken?"""" If you want to watch a good action movie this the movie for you and for anyone really. In the future not all movie are going to this extravagant so people should take sometime to watch a great movie at least once in there life. All I really have to say is this movie is a good action movie for anyone who is willing to watch this movie. This movie is a good movie even for a family night out to the movies and dinner. But if you have a young child that gets scared easily don not go to watch this movie. Other than that its a good movie.""",HKF_Doc3_Taken,HKF,Action,Positive,Taken
144,HKF_Doc4_Taken,"""Liam Neeson is one of my all time favorite actors. I have many of his movies, I would like to have them all. I even have Krull, which will be reviewed sometime in the future. The actors in Taken are some of my favorites as well; Famke Jensen and Maggie Grace are just two of them. I thought the acting by these two and Neeson were phenomenal. Some of the best acting I have ever seen. The script was awesome. The subject matter was pretty daring. The action itself was great. The only negative that I saw was when Liam Neeson was running. But I can't fault him too much, I don't run well either. But enough of that. I give Taken 10 stars out of 10. From start to finish Taken is just a great movie. Liking this movie as much as I did I have a hard time picking three of my favorites scenes. But The three that pop into my mind right now are some of the best of the movie. The first scene is a difficult scene to watch. It's the scene where Amanda (Katie Cassidy) and Kim (Maggie Grace) are kidnapped from Amanda's cousin's apartment in Paris. Kim is talking on the phone with her father, Brian Mills (Liam Neeson). She sees through a window that a couple of guys have grabbed Amanda and she relays this to Brian. Brian tells Kim to go to the next room and hide under the bed. Brian talks to Kim calmly and explains what is going to happen and what he wants her to do. Kim is taken, but as she is being taken from the room she yells out things she sees. When everything is quiet Brian hears someone pick up the cell phone and hears breathing. Brian explains """"I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for, I will find you, and I will kill you."""" The response is """"Good Luck"""" What a great scene. Even if it was difficult to watch. The next scene I like is when Brian finds out where the girls were taken to in order to get them hooked on drugs and turned into prostitutes. He enters the house on the pretense that he is part of the local police force and he is now in charge of collecting the """"shake-down"""" money for not putting a stop to illegal activities. At the end of the conversation Brian asks the five men in the room to translate a phrase he has on a piece of paper, it's in Albanian. The phrase is translated and said out loud by one of the men, who says """"Good Luck."""" At that moment, Brian realizes that that man was the one he talked to on the cell phone that his daughter had. That is when he takes those five men out, along with all the other members of the gang that are in the house. Unfortunately, Brian finds Amanda in one of the upstairs rooms... dead from an apparent drug overdose. Then he finds one of the men alive and tortures him by strapping him to a metal chair and hooking up what looks like jumper cables to the light switch and turns it on. When Brian gets the information he wants, he turns the switch on and leaves it on walking out of the house. Awesome sequence of scenes. It shows that a father will do almost anything to find and protect his children. That being said, the sequence of scenes that lead to Brian rescuing his daughter says that he will do everything possible to save Kim. That is an awesome sequence. Brian Finds out that his daughter is going to be sold because she is a virgin. He finds out through a man he thought he was a friend that the man he needs is St-Clair and where to find him. Brian enters St-Clair's house and finds the auction rooms in the basement. He gets one of the buys to buy his daughter in order to save her. But Brian gets captured and sentenced to death by St-Clair. Brian escapes and kills St-Clair. He then follows after Kim and her """"owners"""" in order to rescue her. He kills everyone on board the boat his daughter has been taken aboard. When he finds Kim she is being held at knife point by Sheik Raman (Nabil Massad). Raman attempts to negotiate, but Brian is in no mood to negotiate, so he puts a bullet through his forehead. There are other scenes I could have talked about. Like when Lenore (Famke Jensen) tries to browbeat Brian into signing the permission form for Kim to go to Paris because she is under 18. Or the scene when Brian goes to his so called friend, Jean-Claude (Olivier Rabourdin), in Paris by going to his apartment and shoots Jean-Claude's wife... in the arm. Or I could have described the scene where Brian saves Sheerah (Holly Valance) from some crazed fan who attempts to stab her after a concert. Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen wrote one hell of a great movie. And Director Pierre Morel did a phenomenal job creating one of my favorite movies.""",HKF_Doc4_Taken,HKF,Action,Positive,Taken
145,HKF_Doc5_Taken,"""An excellent film that exposes the kidnapping and trafficking of women. This film also raises the question why nothing is being done about this. Obviously high ranking officials in the Government are also involved in this which is the reason why it is still going on. There are such SCUM in the world that would sell their own sisters or daughters into prostitution. Back to the film. It was good to see Liam Neeson after a long time. Having seen his best films: Darkman and Rob Roy, I was in eager expectations. The film is relentless from start to finish with superb action sequences and strong to-the-point dialogue. Full Plot: Highly-skilled CIA agent Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) has retired in an effort to build a closer relationship with his teenage daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace). His frequent absences made him a distant father and led to his divorce. Knowing Kim wants to be a singer, Bryan buys her an expensive karaoke machine for her 17th birthday, but he is upstaged by Kim's wealthy stepfather Stuart (Xander Berkeley), who surprises her with a horse. Later, Bryan's former colleague, Sam (Leland Orser), hires him to help provide concert security for a popular young singer, Sheerah (Holly Valance). When Bryan saves her from a knife-wielding attacker, Sheerah gratefully offers to help with Kim's musical aspirations. Bryan's ex-wife, Lenore, (Famke Janssen) and Kim persuade a reluctant Bryan into allowing Kim to travel to Paris with her friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy) to visit museums. Bryan is angered to discover at the airport that the girls actually intend to follow a U2 concert tour throughout Europe, instead of it being a study abroad program like he was originally told. In Paris, Kim and Amanda meet Peter (Nicolas Giraud), a charming young stranger who suggests sharing a taxi from the airport. Peter learns that they are staying alone in Amanda's cousins' apartment. After they part, Peter phones someone and passes along what he has learned. While on the phone with Bryan, Kim sees men enter the apartment and abduct Amanda. Bryan starts recording the call, and instructs Kim to shout out information about the kidnappers when they come for her. Afterward, Bryan realizes that someone is listening on the phone and tells him that if they let his daughter go, he will drop the matter, but if not, """"I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you."""" The listener replies, """"Good luck."""" Bryan has Sam analyze the recording; he determines that the abductors are likely part of the Albanian Mafia, which specializes in sex slavery. He tells Bryan and Lenore of a grim statistic: if Kim is not rescued within 96 hours, chances are she will never be found. When Bryan reaches Paris, he finds his first clue: a photograph of Peter on the memory card of Kim's cellphone. He finds Peter as he is after another victim at the airport. After a short chase, Peter is struck and killed by a truck. Bryan then turns to an old friend, Jean-Claude (Olivier Rabourdin), previously a field agent of French Intelligence, but now working behind a desk. Eventually, the trail leads to a construction site with a makeshift brothel. Posing as a customer, Bryan notices a semi-conscious prostitute who has his daughter's jacket. He rescues her, killing several gangsters in the process. The girl tells Bryan the address of the house where she met Kim. Bryan bluffs his way in, pretending to be a corrupt policeman looking for a bribe. He identifies Marko Ocha as the one he spoke to on the phone, takes him prisoner and kills the other crooks. Searching the house, he finds Amanda dead, apparently from a heroin overdose. Bryan tortures Marko into revealing that, because Kim is a highly valuable virgin, she was sold to Patrice Saint-Clair (Gï¿½rard Watkins). He leaves Marko to die slowly from unending electric shocks. Needing more information, Bryan goes to Jean-Claude's home. Jean-Claude admits to accepting bribes to look the other way and tries to force Bryan at gunpoint to give up his search. Bryan shoots Jean-Claude's wife in the arm to pressure him into giving up Saint-Clair's address. Bryan impersonates a police commissioner to enter an exclusive party at Saint-Clair's mansion. He locates a secret underground facility where a sex-slave auction is underway. Kim is the last offering. Bryan forces a buyer to purchase her, but he is knocked unconscious before he can get to her. He awakens handcuffed to a pipe. After learning Bryan's motive, Saint-Clair orders him killed and leaves. Bryan frees himself, kills Saint-Clair's henchmen, and forces Saint-Clair to divulge Kim's whereabouts before executing him. Bryan sees Kim being forced onto a yacht. Bryan jumps aboard and dispatches the guards. He finds an Arab sheikh holding a knife to Kim's neck. The man starts threatening Kim's life, but before he could finish his sentence, Bryan shoots him in the head. After they return to the United States, Bryan surprises Kim with a visit to Sheerah for an audition. Verdict: an outstanding film overall reminiscent of Commando(1985) and Diehard(1988) in terms of action. A good purchase for your DVD collection.""",HKF_Doc5_Taken,HKF,Action,Positive,Taken
146,HKF_Doc6_Taken,"""I've never written a review before, but this movie angered me so much I felt it's my civic duty to protest. The movie is so full of clichï¿½s and unrealistic it's unbelievable it was made by adults. Apparently, we're supposed to derive some kind of psychological gratification from the Freudian symbols of innocence, fatherly love, superhuman strength and righteousness. It actually reminds me of the fantasies I had when I was 8. Here's the plot: a rich, spoiled American virgin girl goes to Paris with a friend and gets abducted by Albanians and sold into sex slavery. Luckily, her daddy happens to be a ex-CIA agent and tracks them down effortlessly, kills and tortures them in a blood-curdling fashion and gets to his daughter just before she gets her throat slit by the evil (yet also stupid looking so you can still feel good about yourself), toad-like sheik. On his way, daddy makes a such a spectacle of killing and torturing people that it makes you wonder whether anyone would take so much trouble if no third party was watching. He doesn't even spare people who are innocent and are unlucky enough to get in his way. Like the wife of a French agent involved in the mess, whom Neeson shoots in the arm, because her husband refuses to give him information on St-Claire. (Meanwhile, their kids have been tucked into bed 5 minutes ago yet they don't seem to wake up. Yep, totally.) All the circumstances are miraculously in Neeson's favor. His daughter is talking to him on the phone when she gets abducted. (otherwise, how would he know? Most victims of sex slavery are poor East European girls who don't have cell-phones, which would be too boring). Also, she's standing in the bathroom from where she can see her friend being abducted first, so daddy has enough time to instruct her how to hide and to shout out the details of their complexion while being dragged away (at which she miraculously succeeds, despite her panic and the struggle she puts up). Also, multiple men can apparently easily get into a hotel room and abduct two girls, but Neeson has to use Spiderman skills to get inside. Well, thank God the bas relief of the wall was adjusted to his height exactly; otherwise, the movie would have ended there. Another point that disturbed me very much is Neeson indifference to the scores of other girls who have been drugged and raped by Albanians. Apparently, the PRINCIPLE of sex slavery doesn't concern him, just the fact that it happens to HIS daughter. In the end, Neeson returns with his daughter to America, with only a broken arm after fighting hundreds of heavily-armed men. Also, he has no trouble leaving France after killing each and every one of them. (France must be a Third World country). Everyone is happy and his ex-wife has to admit he's not such a loser after all. Every Freudian fascination has been satisfied trice over. This movie does absolutely no justice to Eastern Europeans (all Albanians are shown as stupid scum and we're supposed to gloat seeing them being electrocuted), and above all, the REAL victims of modern sex slavery. I could write a lot more about this piece of garbage but I think I've made my point now. Thank you for your attention.""",HKF_Doc6_Taken,HKF,Action,Negative,Taken
147,HKF_Doc7_Taken,"""To save you the time in either watching this film or reading my critique of it, here is a brief summary: This film is the worst film I have ever seen. This film is atrocious. This film is so unbelievably awful that all the writers, directors, producers and cast that worked on it should be sent to the Hague and tried for crimes against humanity. In the first chapter of this film, three facts are established: 1. There exists a man. He's pretty tough. 2. He loves his daughter very much. 3. Aforementioned daughter is going to Paris. In order to establish these three facts, which any competent writer or director could do in about ten minutes, the film takes over half an hour, quite possibly the most laborious half an hour in cinematic history. As soon as the daughter reaches Paris, she is of course kidnapped. Literally AS SOON. So there is a sudden escalation in pace that doesn't leave the watcher thinking """"WOW, I didn't see that coming"""" or """"Wo, what a skillful escalation in pace"""" but simply """"OH Jesus Christ SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD THANK GOD THAT SOMETHING FINALLY HAPPENED!"""" This sudden plot """"twist"""" of course makes the liberal mother and fat, short stereotypically wealthy stepfather look villainous and the absurdly-paranoid-to-the-degree-that-he-should-seek-professional-help father, who believes his daughter is safer in Los Angeles than Paris, becomes the all-knowing hero. And of course the CIA can detect from a tiny and poor-quality voice sample the hometown of any speaker. So we learn that the daughter has been kidnapped by an Albanian gang who intend to sell her into sex slavery. This is of course the point where the film ceases to be just bad and becomes outright immoral: people trafficking with the intent of prostitution is a real and tangible problem in Europe and indeed all over the world (if you want to see an actually worthy film that deals with the issue I suggest """"Eastern Promises"""", """"Dirty Pretty Things"""" or """"Spare Parts""""). Making it the subject of a Hollywood action film in which the American hero overcomes all the odds to rescue his daughter is insulting to those women who have actually been in this situation. Particularly appalling is the scant disregard that our """"hero"""" shows for the wellbeing of any of the other women. It left me questioning """"is it supposed to be ironic? morally ambiguous? No, it's just a film that chose a very sensitive and inappropriate subject for a formula-produced action movie. As the film continues we are given more and more ridiculous scenes that insult our intelligence. One particularly stupid oversight comes when the hero walks into a brothel posing as a Parisian police officer and the villains show absolutely no suspicion of his being impostor, despite the fact that he talks exclusively in English. And the most ridiculously appalling scene comes at the very end. The girl is safe as she returns from Paris to Los Angeles. Finally, back in America, where everyone's safe! In spite of murdering and torturing so many people and shooting the wife of a leading Parisian police officer, our hero steps off the plane with absolutely no problems. Despite her best friend's death and a terrible ordeal, the girl is happy and shows no signs of trauma whatsoever. And in spite of the thousands of women who suffer in sex slavery every day of their lives, a plight which this film does absolutely nothing to enlighten the world on, we are made to believe this is a happy ending. This film is an insult to my continent and my intelligence, and a mockery of so many people who suffer in silence.

Taken should NEVER have been made. Now for every reviewer that has liked Taken, let me assure you that you are wrong. Is it that every story has been told in cinema, that we must deal with the same old same old...over and over again?? There was NOTHING original in this film. Luc Besson has proved time and again that he can't write. This is his Citizen Kane! Taken is every action/thriller clichï¿½ thrown into one violent shambles. Neeson is a retired agent, who is suffering guilt at a wrecked marriage and at being a bad dad. Yawn. Famke Janssen is the ex-wife. She now is married to a dull rich guy. She rants that Liam was never there for her or the daughter. After spending five minutes with them, you know why! They are horrible! Liam can't compete for the love of his hideous daughter. He buys her a karaoke machine, cos she wants to be a singer! We never get to hear Maggie Grace sing...but then again, we never got to see her act either. New dad buys her a horse, which she rides around her party. Liam takes lots of photos on his throwaway product placement camera...to put in the photo album he keeps of daughters' birthdays. Oh Liam, just don't get all deep and tender and touch the photo...no...NO...he touches the photo!!! Then daughter wants to go to Paris. But really, she's doing all of Europe, following U2! Liam is concerned. The worlds a bad place...and U2 are a bad band! Daughter jets to Paris with airhead blonde girlfriend. They meet an ugly guy with cross eyes. The girls play music really loud and jump around and then the blonde is taken by Albanian human traffickers who were contacted by cross-eyed guy. The daughter phones dad. Then she's 'taken'! There is a fantastic clichï¿½d funny scene as Liam jets to Paris. He holds the tape to his ear,listening to the kidnapper saying """"Good luck"""". He pushes stop, rewind and listens again...and again. It is a side-splitting moment. Within 5 minutes of Taken, you just wish SOMEONE would whack the daughter! She is an acting vacuum and just really annoying. Aaannyway, Liam chases cross-eyed guy, who gets killed by a truck. He's lucky...he got out of this horror story early! Liam does some researching, hangs out in with an Albanian translator...then some hookers. The translator tells Liam that his daughter is at 'the construction site', which Liam finds immediately, because there is only one construction site in Paris! He doesn't find his daughter in the site brothel...but does find her hideous denim bedazzled jacket! He takes drugged girl, jacket and a gun and does some killing and car chasing. Then he saves the girl in his hotel room, with a drip full of stuff to get her over her 'Jones'. Methadone?? Liam is, if nothing else, very prepared for every situation! He starts doing lots of killing around this time. Lots! There is one hilarious scene where he challenges his bent French cop pal (who has just come home with a bread stick under his arm, because that's what French men do! Hahahaha) and Liam shoots the guys wife, then yells, """"It's just a flesh wound!!!"""" as a way of chilling the French dude out! This whole movie is a flesh wound! To the brain. It is funny and it wants to be serious. It is stereotypical, racist, sexist and violent beyond need. Every character is a parody. Liam the conflicted father. The nasty bent French cop. The cold ex-wife. The innocent daughter. The nasty tattooed Albanians...all called Marco! Hahahaha. Liam eventually finds the daughter. She is being auctioned off. Maggie Grace tries on some method acting as if she is drugged. She fails. Maggie goes for half a million dollars! This is insanely overpriced. Now some of you 'reviewers' noted that this film is important for dealing with the topical horror of human trafficking. Umm...can we stop just there? Stop reading into this film! Stop trying to wring some deeper meaning from it. It is not deep or thought provoking. If you truly thought this was a deep, profound storyline, then you are an idiot. Say it with me """"Idiot"""". There. Better? Good. OK...back to the 'plot'. Liam gets the daughter...then gets knocked out! Then we find him tied up over some piping above his head. How many times have you seen this scenario?? And right on cue, the pipe snaps, Liam really snaps...and he is off on some more killing! He searches through some rooms to find his daughter. He finds lots of other girls, chained to beds...but leaves them. He finds blonde girl, but she's dead. He doesn't seem too worried about this. Tough, is our Liam! Liam then steals a car and goes on a long car chase alongside a river, to get to a boat, with his daughter on board. The daughter is found on a boat, in the arms of a fat greasy guy (the head baddies are always fat and greasy) who looks like Jabba the Hutt! Liam kills him. He kills...everyone really. Then he is calmly allowed through international customs to jet on home with his daughter. No questions asked. Oh...and there is still time to pop around to the singer to drop the daughter off for her big break! How peachy! How anyone could find this film interesting, enjoyable or original is quite frankly, probably retarded.

149,HKF_Doc9_Taken,"""This movie was not the work of experts, but a group of random amateurs who saw too many Steven Seagal movies and wanted to cash in on prejudices held on """"SOME"""" of these actors' past successes. The IMDb score tricked me into thinking this was worth the time, but let me give feedback appropriately by mentioning the best things first and then go on to the worst parts. The only good (funny) part: When the protagonist contacts a previous CIA contact, that turns out to be a fraud, he shoots the man's innocent wife in the arm, in order to get information. As my bro said, she was depicted as a French housewife, whose life held no value. This was pure dark humor, that got me laughing, because this cutthroat abusive behavior is not the behavior you expect of someone (supposedly) ex-CIA, but expect of a retired pimp. Then the worst parts: The disregard of all life forms that are not American. It is as though this movie hopes to accomplish complete disregard for all human life forms outside the USA, he kills so many people and ignores the suffering of so many girls that have the same age as his daughter that you end up hoping there will be some mention of these factors in the last minute of the movie. Nonetheless, in the end all that matters is the safe return of the spoiled American brat. Nobody cared for the other girls used as prostitutes, because they were not American. A note to the writer: this move plays out in France and THIS IS NOT THE MATRIX OTHER LIFE FORMS DO EXIST!!!!! The plot. As there was none, it was all predictable if you ever saw a Steven Seagal movie, except most of those actually have some form of content... The movie The innocence of M. was a movie with a plot of a similar level. Portrait of France. This country known for its refined culture is portrayed as a poverty stricken third world country, that happens to host the Louvre and some museums. This is confirmed by, the protagonist never considering contacting authorities and instead decides to kill all criminals he meets himself. The Credibility. Ex-CIA? Yeah right, for the sake of the USA I hope the CIA has more Intelligence... like I said, he was more like a retired pimp who's stash got busted and was out for revenge. This movie does not attempt to have you believe 10 seconds of its story line, it's all fantasy of an overexcited Steven Seagal fan. The acting. After the first scene I hoped his daughter would just die, because this spoiled brat can't act! She sucked in Lost and still does. Furthermore, everything resembles a Steven Seagal movie, the only good actors in this movie are possibly the French female addict, he only helps because she is wearing his daughter's jacket (BTW, she gets discarded after the protagonist gets his information). Furthermore, the protagonist was mediocre at acting, he used the script as a bible and unfortunately his face only knows 3 expressions: anger, anxiety and satisfaction. But, 80% of the time he just portrayed an angry tourist. My recommendation is if you have an IQ above 45, this movie will not meet your expectations of a movie made by people with an IQ above 20. All this movie tries to inspire is to randomly kill people while you're in a foreign country on vacation or looking for your spoiled slightly retarded daughter. This piece of trash gives all Americans a bad name and does not teach anybody anything, save yourself, the time, money and breath it takes to deal with this product made by amateur American Hollywood residents without a passport.""",HKF_Doc9_Taken,HKF,Action,Negative,Taken
150,HKF_Doc10_Taken,"""Poor Liam. He's ex-CIA, which we find out when all his ex-CIA friends show up at his house and start reminiscing about the old days in the CIA. How convenient that his ex-CIA buddies talk him into a bodyguard job where he heroically saves a no-name singer from being knifed to death. This allows him to not only prove his manhood and hand-to-hand combat skills, but also get the singer's business card to give to his daughter slash aspiring pop princess (not that she sings at all in the movie). Did I mention she just turned 17 and received of all things a PONY from her rich step-dad at the extravagant birthday party he threw for her? Oh, and she wants to go to Paris with her best friend. just the two of them, and needs her dad's signature on some immigration form. Liam is skeptical about sending his daughter to Paris. But her mom (Liam's ex-wife) wastes no time telling us about how she hated his CIA job and can't believe Liam would be hesitant to send his daughter to Paris unescorted. I mean, what's the worst that could possibly happen to two teenage girls by themselves in Paris? How dare he be so paranoid? After all, they will be staying at her friend's cousin's house in Paris, and like most parents who send their underage daughters to Paris without adult supervision, she didn't call the cousins to ask about the arrangements. And oh, by the way, instead of just staying in Paris, they're going to be traveling all over Europe to see U2 concerts. With that kind of subplot I can't believe U2 didn't take this opportunity to include one of their songs in this movie. Fast forward after a 12-hour flight and the girls arrive completely fresh in Paris. Immediately a young man approaches them and wants to share a cab to save money. How smart of the girls to accept his money-saving offer. Next thing you know, the girls get to the apartment and immediately tell the dude that they're staying there alone. Didn't their parents tell them not to talk to strangers? About this time I start apologizing to my husband about how incredibly stupid this movie is. I even offered to see if we could get our money back. My only hope was that the girl get kidnapped soon so that we could get to some more exciting parts of the movie. Thank goodness the kidnapping scene was minutes away, and I admit that scene got my heart pumping. If only the rest of the movie were that good. Lest we leave any clichï¿½s unturned, we now return to Liam. His dialog indicates he's flat broke, but his daughter's step-dad is rich and can send Liam to Paris on a private jet. Naturally mom and step-dad stay behind, because that's what most parents would do when their daughter is kidnapped overseas into the female slave trade. After his arrival in Paris, Liam hooks up with an old cop friend (don't *you* have any old cop friends in Paris?). Now, what kind of French character should the cop be? How about we name him Jean-Claude and have him walk home carrying a baguette? That way everyone will know he's French! One thing about Liam's character: he takes no prisoners. He has no problem shooting a dude in the back of the head as he runs away. Pretty much everyone who gets in his way gets either a bullet or """"daim bramage"""" from a blunt object. Given Liam's single-minded pursuit of his daughter, even innocent people are at risk. For example, it should come as no surprise that Liam would shoot a bad guy's wife in the arm to get information from him. My husband and I laughed heartily, like we might've done at that mall cop movie (which I wish we'd seen instead). Miraculously, Liam remains largely uninjured despite a good 100 people shooting at him. Even Jason Bourne shows some signs of wear from time to time, but he's not rescuing his daughter from a polygamist sheik and therefore lacks Liam's bullet-proof resolve. And lest anyone worry that his daughter was robbed of her innocence, we are told via an auctioneer that she's """"guaranteed pure."""" Whew! I'll spare you the heartwarming tale of the daughter's rescue and homecoming. Too bad her pony didn't show up at the airport.

151,VKX_Doc1_ItChapterTwo,"""When the Stephen King's 'IT' remake came out in 2017, it had much to live up to, - just given the way King's films are potrayed, it hd to live up to the thirll like his other flms have done, while remaining true to it's origins as well as book portions - which it did - I gave IT 8/10 previously. Casting - The kids in chapter one were stellar - and the casting director was spot in with the choices that he made to select the high school kids to face the crazed clown. This film was no different. not only did the casting director pick five adults who portrayed the resemblance of the young kids very well, but also casted 5 'adult' characters that complemented each other on screen very well. It literally felt like they were the same kids 27 years ago growing up in the small town of Berry - I don't think there has been a film to depict such a great resemblance in all the movies i have seen with a continuous story attached to it. The fight back - The 27 year return to the small town felt like a smoothe transition for the viewers and I at least felt that these kids who had seemingly 'defeated' Pennywise before could do it again. i felt every fear that these grown adults now were facing to face the crazed clown. The 'token' segments even gave us more inside stories to what happened when they were kids adding even more depth the film's story and built up the ultimate showdown of why these kids must defeat the pennywise - who'm they have been fearing this whole time. The film really thought of everything to add to, to make the smoothe transition towards the final battle between the now older kids. Everything just meshed so perfectly together. The only downfall I would say is how the kids from Berry had figured out how to defeat him - no spoilers here , but at first I felt with what the writers came up with , was a tad bit dull - but then you have to actually think about the given message in the film, as to why it worked , and why it hadn't worked before. The messages might seem clear to some , and not clear to others - but I am not spoiling it just for the fact I would want you to get that satisfaction of figuring it out yourself - within that given message the defeat of the clown makes sense , and although , the final battle scene could have had a few minor tweaks here and there, it ultimately wasn't too bad, it still worked. #Duration The length of the film is nearly 3 hours and although some might be complaining about that - it honestly needed to be. The film flowed so perfectly and kept me intrigued for the entire time - It had to be that long because there was so much they needed to add, and they added the right segment to conclude the IT series. The writing was superb and excellent Rating: 9/10 - It had everything you could ask for - the adults were just as funny as the kids were / the chemistry was there all the same / the resemblances to the younger versions were spot on / there was actually some jump off moments, although predictable on some occasions, it still was brilliantly done. I also did watch this in IMAX so it added some extra fright with the sound fx and music, but oh by gawd , i paid full price for this film, and honestly i would have paid double (maybe... thats a lot of money for a film - would definitely pay it for both films together) Really enjoyed the film and its a definite buy when it comes out. Watch the first one on Netflix because you honestly have to get the origin story and then go watch this ASAP , you wont be disappointed.""",VKX_Doc1_ItChapterTwo,VKX,Horror,Positive,It Chapter Two
152,VKX_Doc2_ItChapterTwo,"""IT CHAPTER : 2 - Damn this movie was so satisfying and fulfilling. i loved it. It gave me a completion which satisfied my inner heart. A satisfaction almost on the level of completion what Harry Potter 8 and Dark Knight Rises gave me (well yes slightly less than those two movies , but you can understand what i am trying to say). Its has now became my most favorite Horror Movie of all time. Chapter 1 was a really awesome movie by itself. And to top that was almost an impossible hurdle. And from most of the reactions and reviews it seems like the audience is not exactly satisfied with the film. I don't understand what they were expecting. For me the last movie in any series must give you the feeling that this was the way it must have ended. Just like Dark Knight Rises was not needed to be like Dark Knight. It had to be something altogether different because it was the concluding movie and it did that particular thing brilliantly. That same thing is now done by IT CHAPTER : 2 , at least for me. OK first and foremost i am gonna address the things which has been criticized most about the movie by the reviewers. 1] Was it a movie too long than it actually should have been ? No. Not at all . I was never bored. Yes there were 1 or 2 scenes which could have been edited. But that would have shortened the movie by may be only 5 mins. Which would have been totally meaningless. In-fact i was so much involved in the atmosphere of the movie that i could have happily seen 15 more mins of this movie. 2] Was the D-Aging of Child Artists for flashback scenes too distracting ? Hell No. I wouldn't even has recognized those effects if i haven't read about the same thing in the reviews before watching the film. 3] Was the ending too bad? No No No. I don,t understand why the ending of this movie (which is also the ending of the book) has been disliked by so many people. Its good. Simple yet effective. 4] Lastly did the flashback scenes were unnecessary for the film? Are you kidding me. Those were some of the greatest scenes of the movie. So great that if those scenes would have been in the first movie instead of this one than the first one could been a better movie by itself. But that would have made this one lesser good. So that's about wrap up all the complaints. Now about what i liked? The VISUAL EFFECTS mixed with PRACTICAL EFFECTS and PRODUCTION DESIGN was the top thing about this movie. Oscar nomination worthy. The 70m$ spent on the movie (doubling the budget of the first one) was clearly visible on the screen. And the money has been spent in a very innovative way. This one is also definitely the most Beautiful (in a horrific , scary and dark way) looking movie of all time. Then obviously comes the Cast. Bill Skarsgï¿½rd has made Pennywise so much his own as much as Heath ledger had made Joker of his own. There is nothing much to say about him. He was just out of this world in a very crazy way. But the standout performance of this film was Bill Hader. His comic timing, was 200% spot-on. There were so many awkward situation where the writer has given him the jokes that any other actor could have done wrong. But not him. I also loved the fact that neither the director nor James McAvoy & Jessica Chastain tried to use their Stardom too much. They both just mixed-up with the bigger assemble cast and never tried to chew the scenes anymore than needed. Not a single actor has done a job which is below good. The background score was a little underdone than the first part. i would have liked more creepiness. But it was not bad at all. Same goes for the cinematography which goes perfectly with the movie but didn't stand out as the first movie did. The last showdown ? O my my. It was so good. So great. Pretty long (in a very satisfying kind of way where you don't want something to end very quickly). i cant praise enough that particular act. It was heart crunching, in a literal way. And than there was the extended ending. So emotional. Such a tribute to true friendship and nature of scarifies. Very very very fulfilling. O yes, almost forgot (because i never watch Horror movies as just Horror movies), this one definitely had larger number (and better too) of horror scenes than the first one. I judged that by the number of screams i was hearing from the audience. So just watch it""",VKX_Doc2_ItChapterTwo,VKX,Horror,Positive,It Chapter Two

The scare-reveals far exceeded expectation in their detail, artistry and morbidity. The score was markedly brilliant and matched the theatrical expectation of a cinematic experience. The sound design and voice modulation SFX were crisp, with rich harmonics, overtones and punchy bass. The casting decisions prove: that careful effort will produce amazing results for continuity-in-storytelling and suspension of disbelief; expertly executed here -in multiple ways. The presentation of victimization by the antagonist is so talent-fully executed, the audience feels split between sadness and satisfaction as characters meet their demise. One scene, truly emulates what it might be like for a mammal to act like a reptile; and how it might go about doing so -right at the exact moment its prey finds itself entirely inside that predator's kill zone (cheers to the actor, director and editor). This film genuinely straddled two incompatible worlds fluidly; one of horror, shock, torment and terror; with another of actuality per how humans speak and think, how they make decisions differently from each other, and somehow too; a parallel world where humor remains a legitimate mode of thought even despite any level of absurdity-of-circumstance. This film can be watched -easily once every year and half or so, with friends or by oneself; and not be bored. Other films like 2001, The Goonies, Caddyshack -all also have this quality. The theater staff DID float a red helium filled balloon inside the room during the film; causing the words """"oh (hell) no, oh (hell) no..."""" to be audible from folks in the back of the theater LOL! All in all; very satisfying. Emotionally; this felt like a roller coaster ride with a LOT of highs! Enjoy!""",VKX_Doc3_ItChapterTwo,VKX,Horror,Positive,It Chapter Two
154,VKX_Doc4_ItChapterTwo,"""If you are looking for scary jumps that any classic horror film can offer you, this is NOT your movie. It's a pure *psychological* horror. By that I mean it amazingly depicts how our childhood experiences affect our life choices later on as we enter into adulthood. It focuses on the theme that we let our fears stop us from doing well in life. The more we hold on to our fears, the stronger it gets along with added troubles. And it's all in our head. Some of us know how to conquer our fears, while the others who aren't able to cope up lose their paths and commit serious mistakes or take extremely wrong choices in life. Going into the details(spoiler alert) Why does IT prey on small children ? Not all children! but the ones who have had some troubled experiences. Like the girl who has a face mark and says that her friends make fun of her, a boy who is gay and gets bullied by other children, a boy who stammers and is made fun off by others, a girl whose father is extremely abusive, a boy who is made fun of for his big size, a boy who was bullied about his parents for his skin color... and so on. The story shows That a group of small children were able to fight IT in their childhood but somehow it appears again after 27 years ! Why 27 years ? Now this is just my opinion or what I gained from the movie, that we usually make big decisions about life when we are in our late 20s. It's usually during that period of time when we make big choices about career, marriage, and so on. It's during this time that we develop a personality which is hugely dependent on our childhood and other life altering experiences. The girl who was abused by her father in her childhood is shown married to a guy who abuses her(a choice she made in her adulthood). The guy who was bullied as a child for being fat worked out and shaped his body, excelled well in his career, the guy bullied for being gay isn't married and doesn't have a life partner yet.. and so on. What you make out of life is dependent on how well you have let go off the childhood traumas.some of us just repress our memories, which is exactly what they all had done when they left Dery to go on to live in our cities. Now Once again they all have to go back to *Dery* in order to face their fears and stop IT's terror. They feel the need to stop bad things happening to other children. They relive their childhood memories and face IT again after 27 years. This is the main theme of the movie. The movie leaves a mark and gives the audience something to think about. Especially the ending! Just before when IT is about to die (or go away) He takes the form of all the different bullies and in the end turns into a scared and small version of itself. The characters weren't able to kill him with a sword/knife or some kind of a spell(which happens in most of the horror films). Instead they killed him by conquering their fear. They say """"you are just a clown, you are so small, a bully, you mean nothing, we aren't scared of you"""". This is how they conquer their fears. Thats when IT says that you all have become adults, you all have grown up and dies. All in all, what a wonderful way to spread a strong message across the audience. This movie is Scary, funny, psychological and contains a meaningful message. It's a masterpiece. Just my opinion.""",VKX_Doc4_ItChapterTwo,VKX,Horror,Positive,It Chapter Two
155,VKX_Doc5_ItChapterTwo,"""I was really looking forward to this one, especially after the fantastic 1st part, which totally nailed the story on so many levels - the faithfulness of the story, the scares and the actors. And then the first reviews came out for this one, I got scared: almost everywhere it was only called as average at best. Still, today I went to see it, and l was happy to do so. I think, many people just view this story as a simple horror story. However, in my opinion, that's a big misunderstanding as the story of IT - as a whole - is not a horror. Not at all. It is a drama with horror elements. The book itself is one of the most important one of my library. Though, only having read the book twice in my life, it played both time a crucial part of that period; the first time as 18-19 years old - before heading to College and the 2nd one being around 26-27 years old. Because what this story is about? We all remember how we told each other in primary/secondary schools, that with those friends how we would stay always in contact, how our friendship would stand the test of time. Then you move on, and realize that how quickly you forgot those friends. As 18-19 year old, having read this part of the book and seeing how such strong connect can break up easily, it upset me, made me question a lot of things. As 26-27-year-old, I understood better, I saw other parts of the story relevant. Started to understand that its the part of the normal life, that people - who you call friends, and cannot imagine your everyday's life without them - just vanish, but still can be brought back when needed or called upon - you don't need serial killers to do that, it's completely fine, when other reasons lie behind them. I agree with those, who say this film should be seen as a whole (part 1 + 2) and not a typical """"longer, better, scarier"""" type of movie. For me this was a really, really good movie, where I have seen some brilliant acting, and seeing people learning to face their fears of their childhood - which they thought they burried, but was always a part of their life. As negatives, I do agree, that the movie tends to drag at times, and some parts I found unneccesary or - due to the lack of time (when the film was also long enough) didn't get enough explaining, therefore their appearances being meaningless. Here I talk about Henry Bowers and the Silver; both got their screen time, but would have nothing happened had they had been cut from the movie. They just arrived and the movie quickly wraped up their part. Some reviews critised the humour of the film. I didn't find it distracting, as I have seen the movie more as a drama than a horror, I didn't feel that out-of-place. I mean, okay, they weren't highly sophisticated jokes, but, easily could have been much worse. All in all, I really do not regret seeing this movie.""",VKX_Doc5_ItChapterTwo,VKX,Horror,Positive,It Chapter Two
156,VKX_Doc6_ItChapterTwo,"""27 years after the members of The Losers' Club defeated It, visions of the clown start popping up again. Mike Hanlon calls everyone up for a meeting to come up with a plan to defeat It once and for all. Like the first movie, it starts off promising enough with the opening scene. Eddie and Adrian just want to have a nice day at the theme park, but are confronted by a couple of bullies who try to intimidate them. They get annoyed, but walk away from them. After they get cornered again however, Adrian starts mouthing off, going so far as to insult one of their haircuts. As you might expect, this doesn't end well. What makes this scene so much more impactful than any other in the whole movie is that it's the only one which feels real. The violence inflicted upon them just for their sexuality is very disturbing, and the tragedy is heightened when Adrian gets thrown off a bridge. It then finds him as well and eats him brutally, but the scariest part is the homophobic violence shown just before. Though it's still notable for being the *only* scene where any restraint is shown with the clown at all. As you can tell, I'm already getting into my negatives. This movie was horrendous. As someone who wasn't even a fan of the first one, I would much rather watch that one again since it seemed to care about its characters at least. Which is something It: Chapter Two doesn't. If you're looking for good character development and interactions, look elsewhere. Instead it seems more interested in wasting its time on extremely obnoxious and laughably unscary jumpscares. I was laughing out of embarrassment every time the movie tried to be scary. Who did they think they were fooling? Fortune cookies cracking open Gremlins-style, one of them having an insect with a baby's head? A Paul Bunyon statue showing off its big scary teeth? A naked old lady with hanging tits? A hobo making out with your mother? These attempts at trying to spook you were so phony I couldn't tell if they were trying to be funny or not. There's one part which clearly was supposed to be intense, but for some weird god-damn reason they added comedic music to it. It completely ruins any sense of danger they tried to establish, and comes off as a cringeworthy way to make the audience laugh, since at the test screening everybody already laughed anyway. The CGI effects work is as fake-looking as it gets. Honestly, I'm surprised a lot of it even got past the pre-production stage. The dialogue is horrible. Instead of incorporating humor into the script naturally when it *fits*, every serious moment is ruined by a stupid one-liner. Richie especially deflated the tension all the time by either pointing out they are in trouble (as if we're too dumb to get it) or saying something goofy at the most inappropriate time. If they were going for a horror comedy it's too tonally inconsistent, not to mention most of the jokes are so lame anyway they're not funny. And when they try to be heartwarming it's so overdone and clichï¿½ that you keep rolling your eyes at the self help-esque quotes they keep spitting at you. I swear, there are maybe FIVE MONOLOGUES throughout, and they all sound exactly the same. Even Beverly's dad, one of the few creepy things about the first, comes off as a joke in the few scenes he appears in. The way he sprays his daughter furiously with perfume is so absurd I couldn't take it seriously, not to mention the moment where Beverly's inside a bathroom filled with blood and he keeps chanting """"COME TO DADDY"""". Just like everything else it's too over-the-top. And for a clown as powerful as It, the way he gets defeated is absolutely pathetic. Forget fighting him to death, trick him in any way, or even the ritual Mike keeps going on about (which conveniently he """"forgets"""" way too late it doesn't work). No, let's just call him a few hurtful words and he'll shrink to the size of a baby. I sh'it you not. The most evil and otherwordly clown alive is weakened by being called a regular circus clown. The scriptwriter really must have backed himself into a corner with this one. The acting is mixed. Bill Hader is good (even though I find his character a bit annoying). Jessica Chastain gave a very earnest performance, and was probably the best out of the main cast. Isaiah Mustafa and James Ransone were all right. James McAvoy was a little off however, which was disappointing. His stuttering doesn't feel like it comes out naturally. Jaeden Martell as the kid version of Bill did it much more convincingly. Bill Skarsgï¿½rd, and this might come as an unpopular opinion, was pretty hard to watch. To be fair the material he gets is ridiculous, but his line delivery was so exaggerated and goofy I wondered if he was trying to keep himself from cracking up or something. Most of all however, I was bored to tears. With all the constant repetition of jumpscares and scenes dragging on and on, I kept asking my friend """"How much do we have left?"""" since I could barely wait to leave the theater. No way in hell the merciless 2 hour and 48 minute run time is justified. The biggest higlights are the cameos by Stephen King and Peter Bogdanovich. Skip this sorry excuse of a """"horror"""" movie.""",VKX_Doc6_ItChapterTwo,VKX,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two
157,VKX_Doc7_ItChapterTwo,"""On the eve of seeing this, yet another sequel, I pondered as to the logic behind 169 minutes. No horror movie has ever required that amount of time to get its story across and this one shouldn't have either. SPOILER ALERT Like the title says, if you only want to be entertained with scary scenes and the redundant CGI that carried the first one (I rate the first one higher, btw), then, by all means, have at it. But I can't get by the time invested only to be rewarded with a weak story, an almost carbon copy to the first and over-the-top CGI and scary scenes in an attempt to top the first movie. The writers threw anything and everything at the viewer because they simply could. With a story so weak, clouded by fluff, one hour in, I began to realize that the first act wasn't even necessary. Penny-wise returns. Let's call everyone and draw out where every adult is now, after instructing them to return to Derry. After we complete that immensely painful intro, let's take them, once again through their childhood memory and ultimate fear, one at a time. THIS IS WHERE THE MOVIE SHOULD HAVE STARTED!! This is your first act! You could have started here and resulted with the same conclusion and saved us at least 45 minutes bringing the movie down to an appropriate two hours. Now, getting to all the weaknesses. First off, the LGBTQ community should have nothing to complain about after the opening scene of two gay men being the catalyst that launches Pennywise's return. And why did the clown return? What happened in 27 years to have the clown return NOW. Not even a conjuring by reading evil script was used to create this, as cliche as that would have been. At least it would have been something. No character arcs to speak of. Bev had an abusive marriage. Okay. That's terrible. End of story. Ritchie had the worst kept secret in the whole movie that he loved Eddie, but yet the movie did nothing to move that subplot. And WHY, why was the psychotic kid, who escaped from the asylum in the movie? He accomplished nothing, absolutely nothing. He came, he stabbed, he died. And Stan, who just couldn't cut it. We see him commit suicide, then the ending is a cop-out tell, don't show moral of the story in the form of """"not a suicide note"""" that rambled on and on. Twice, I got up from my seat to leave, only to be forced back down with more monologue from the grave. Oh and the moral of story? Still? We're all losers. Great message, again! And now the ending. Sigh. After everything that happened, two plus hours of waiting, what is the solution? Let's talk the clown down to baby size(""""You're nothing but a clown! You clown you. Stupid clown"""") , rip his heart out and collectively squeeze it to death. Are you kidding me? Did I just sit through this tale of redundancy to be rewarded with that? I don't mind being entertained but entertain me with some originality with a decent story. In a perfect world, I want a unique script with great characters, taking a great story and driving it forward to a creative conclusion. But, like Billy's book from the movie, the ending was terrible... and so was the beginning... and middle.

158,VKX_Doc8_ItChapterTwo,"""First of all, this is my first review here, and IT is the first movie that made me do the effort. There is a simple reason for this: I am 41 years old man that read the book back at the age of the main characters and was captivated. Thriller, horror - all was good enough, but the genuine story and developing relationship between the kids was what bought me in then and now, and this books remains my favorite one till present. I remember being much surprised about how the kids thought the same way I did back then, I could connect to their problems, longings, fears and hopes. I have read it multiple times (easy 50+ times) till now, also as an adult, just going back into the growing relationships and feelings, and love and hope, true friendship - this always makes me feel good, a little sad (at the ending), but still in a good way. This is why it was a must for me to see the adaptation of IT, and here I went to watch the first movie. It was bad enough (for the same reasons below), but I patiently waited for Chapter Two. However, where the first movie made wrong, the second movie progressed into disaster. Going back to the movie, all set and casting (as visual looks, though, as acting I did not like - but it was mainly because of the script, in my thought) was really promising. But, all else went downhill, and this is what I mean (ATTENTION: spoilers ahead): Where everything made sense in the book, including all efforts of IT to unsuccessfully kill all of the Losers, here nothing make sense in the movie. If you have not read the books, you simply cannot understand why IT does not kill them once and for all, but plays with them till eventually they kill IT. All IT's actions was ridiculous and meaningless, in most cases. Not even starting on SGI, enough said in other reviews (terribly overkill). No growing connection and relationship between the characters, neither as kids nor as adults. Ben built the clubhouse ALONE before getting along with the rest of the kids (what a club house is this, if it is not made in the club?), the dam scene is deleted entirely (and this was exactly the Losers bonded together as a club), the Smoke ritual was made only by Mike and as an adult, the meeting as adults was soulless and tasteless in many occasions. I do not think the Club ever did anything meaningful together in the movie (except for the rock fight, which feels rushed and illogical, in the absence of the rest). Even the last collisions with IT were done individually (except the ridiculous end, but for this a bit below). Henry Bowers (and the rest) role to drive the Losers together is completely missed, which made his participation into the movie completely unnecessary. In addition, while the book made it clear that killing Henry (which was much a victim of IT, as the rest of the kids anyway) was almost equally bad and helping IT, and though Henry did die in the book, no one of the Losers was actually aiming to kill him. This does not work in the movie - they split Henry's skull, and immediately continue to run jokes between themselves. Come on, guys, it does not make sense. In the book Bill was the natural leader of the Losers, both as kid and adult. His motivation as a kid for avenging his brother's death grew into an wider understanding of the numerous deaths of kids throughout the years, which kept him going and leading the Losers ahead of the collision with IT. There is nothing like this in the movie, they even made Mike the leader of the group as adults (come on, Hollywood, how politically correct you need to be? One Afro-American in the group, and we need to make him the Leader to keep all satisfied?) The letter from Stan Uris at the end was a lazy and stupid way to explain something, which should never need explanation. And beside this is completely not coherent with the book as far as Stan's motivation to kill himself. Pathetic. Beverley visions of the future - useless, meaningless, stupid, at best. The end collision with IT had some potential - and I would understand if they beat IT though love and some natural positive power, or whatever. But they did kill it through bullying IT - calling IT bad names, swearing at it... Come on, guys, I know it is very difficult to adapt the complicated ending in the book, but so same lame a try is too much. Finally, one thing which really upset me off, was adding a home-sexual thing between Richie and Eddie. Where this came from, I will always wonder, and the only reason I did not go out of the theater at this stage was that this came as a fact at the very end of the movie. Again trying to be politically correct or what, I simply do not understand. I can probably continue like this with a long list, but there is no need. As a resume, I do not think that anyone that enjoys the book (as I did) will ever like this adaptation, as it has very little (if any) of the book spirit and message into it. For the ones that have not read the books (thus, not being able to connect the abyss of missing dots), probably it will not make much sense, but if you are into a following set of jump scares and overkill-SGI monsters, it might be watchable. Finally, the mini-series of IT had their flaws, but they had a much better grasp of the book message and feeling, they had a heart and soul, and made me connect to the Losers, which is why I enjoyed watching them. Which is not something I can say for IT and IT Chapter Two.""",VKX_Doc8_ItChapterTwo,VKX,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two
159,VKX_Doc9_ItChapterTwo,"""I really enjoyed the first one - not an avid Steven King reader but this is a classic. First off, Pennywise feeds odd fears. Apparently it was stuck in clown mode because everyone kept getting the same version of pennywise and it didn't adapt to each person's fears like they do in everything else It related. The adults look nothing like the kids. I mean seriously they weren't even trying. There's a music scene in there that gave me Deadpool flashbacks that actually was an editing accident but they were too rushed to fix it. There were so many stupid jokes that it outnumbered their very poorly executed jump scares 10-1. The movie was so predictable that I could say what was going to happen right before it did. Why and how did a child go missing in a fun house for that long - getting trapped inside a glass box in a mirror maze - and no one noticed he was gone?? How are these guys not in prison they literally left a trail of bodies, including one of them putting a pickaxes in someone's head, then puking, and then fled the scene. They left a guy buried in the bottom of a well?? And fled the scene were a kid was murdered?? And then went home. Yeaaahh no. And since when is pennywise a frikkin alien?? Why did the tub they burned everything in not burn up? I mean seriously leather or wood the thing is gonna go up. And did this girl just walk into someone's house, go into the bathroom and just start ripping baseboards out? Not even quietly. And then left it. Why did the kids have completely different personalities than they did in the first? And why did they start off talking about the part they don't remember AFTER pennywise but suddenly we are having flash backs before then and it has nothing to do with their conversation? Okay so this guy slit his wrists because the memories hit him and he went mad. It's the reason they all stayed, because if not they would all end up dead the same way...but yet later they read some letter saying he did it because he wasn't strong enough to go back and knew they would fail if he was alive and didn't go. But wait doesn't everyone have amnesia about that summer? Which one is it? Omg I could keep going. The only saving grace is pennywise had a fantastic performance, but it was incredibly overwhelmingly stupid. They tried to cover how stupid the movie is with generic one like comedy. Which completely suffocates the horror movie feel. I can't believe they released this garbage. I can't believe they tried to pass those adult actors off as grown up versions of the kids. I can't believe they spent half that movie in conversation that contradicts itself consistently. """"We have to stick together or we fail"""" """"everyone split up and find their artifact"""" """"I can't wait there's no time"""" (while everyone is right there in the house). Or how about at some point it turned into evil dead and a zombie was driving a psychopath around on a murder spree against the main characters with absolutely no explanation as to why. Just horrible. If you're reading this and haven't seen it, don't waste your money. I'm sure it will be streaming soon enough it's just a pile of poop. Even my 11 year old hated it. He said the theater smelled because the movie was so much poop you could smell it. It was that bad. Only reason it's not a 1 is for the inside joke about Steven King not being able to write a good ending. Even tho they beat that one into the ground too.""",VKX_Doc9_ItChapterTwo,VKX,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two
160,VKX_Doc10_ItChapterTwo,"""I haven't read every review here, but I agree if the whole crux of the movies rests on the Losers 27 years ago and in the present, it is like trying to make a meal out of a bag of potato chips--it is mostly air trapped in a big wind-bag of a few tasty morsels. I am an author so I always pay more attention to the book than the movie. Everybody is focusing on the Losers, then and now. But IT, in all its forms, is just as much of a character as Derry is because it has shaped the town for centuries to meet its needs.IT comes to feed every 27 years for roughly a one year period. Its cycle starts with a particularly gruesome killing, and ends its cycle with a bloodbath. In Stephen King's book, some of the bombshells that closed out IT's season was a lumberjack going mad and chopping men up inside of a barroom like he was in a trance; the shooting massacre in the main street of Derry, Bonny and Clyde style, of a minor gang in the 1920s who were just passing through when they had car trouble; an Easter egg hunt for all of the kids of the town held out by a factory that exploded during the festivities and killed tens of children and adults; and my favorite recounting, the burning of The Black Spot, a club the black enlisted men at the army base in Derry built with the approval of their superiors because they weren't allowed to go to the whites' only club on base, circa WWII. IT didn't just feed on children; IT also fed on the root of adult fears too. I think if the above had been included, IT could've been made into THREE movies that tied up all loose ends that are left hanging. Beverly's backstory could've been carried out to its conclusion with the death of her control freak husband. Bill finding and buying Silver would actually have a point instead of just being a throw-away cameo (which makes me wonder if Stephen King really has that accent since he has lived most of his life in Maine?) There's no reason to find Silver again except for the appearence of Bill's wife. The one thing I LOVED about the movie was how Ben and Beverly saved each other from their respective fears which were about to kill them. Ben knew Beverly thought Bill wrote the poem from an earlier conversation, and had it hidden in him that he would always be known as the fat kid who never got the girl. But he whipped out that poem that gave her the strength to beat the trap she was in, so that she could save him. The clown is sparingly used, as are the other incarnations used to scare the Losers. In the book, they aren't Mentally CGI'd on steroids. It is the simplest things in life that are the scariest. The rest is ridiculous. Anyway, my thoughts that are definitely different because I want more of what I think are the most interesting parts of the story.""",VKX_Doc10_ItChapterTwo,VKX,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two
161,GKK_Doc1_TheToxicAvenger,"""1984's """"The Toxic Avenger"""" is the movie that put Troma Entertainment on the map. Previously employed as a distribution machine for titillation comedies, Troma hit pay dirt when they switched their focus to silly splatter efforts and horror pictures, finding a rabid audience who couldn't get enough of their specialized brand of winky mayhem. """"The Toxic Avenger"""" is the prototype for subsequent Troma endeavors, mixing a bewildering cocktail of one-liners and ultraviolence in a production that actually desires to make audiences laugh, even while it kills a kid and a dog, and points a shotgun at a baby. Still, the earnestness of the feature is amazing, always working to find a note of absurdity to molest as directors Michael Herz and Lloyd Kaufman (billed here as """"Samuel Weil"""") bathe the screen in blood, nudity, and slapstick, funneled into a superhero spoof with a vague environmental message. 30 years after its initial release and """"The Toxic Avenger"""" still manages to trigger disgust and a handful of laughs, representing not only a key Troma financial victory, but it's quite possibly their finest original work. Melvin (Mark Torgl) is a hopeless weakling working as a janitor at the Tromaville Health Club, where he mops floors and is subjected to constant bullying from its customers, including Bozo (Gary Schneider) and Slug (Robert Prichard), and their girlfriends, Julie (Cindy Manion) and Wanda (Jennifer Babtist). When a prank goes horribly wrong, Melvin jumps into a barrel of toxic waste, with the resulting mutation turning him into a powerful monster with strong moral values. Out to help the fine folks in Tromaville, the Toxic Avenger (Mitch Cohen) is transformed into a hero, a development that irritates Mayor Belgoody (Pat Ryan Jr.), whose corrupt ways are threatened by this new arrival. As Toxie takes a blind girlfriend in Sara (Andree Maranda), the melted savior is marked for death by Mayor Belgoody, threatening the future safety of the beleaguered community.""""The Toxic Avenger"""" has a weird joyfulness that's infectious, even while it stages ghastly deaths and dismemberments. Kaufman and Herz construct a rather effective silent comedy in the midst of all the brutality, with the picture playing just as effectively with the sound shut off. With a cast that wildly gesticulates with every line reading, broad physical comedy, and a hulking, deformed hero, it's fairly easy to follow the feature without hearing it, as it periodically reaches Vaudeville-style shenanigans. It's not a tasteful endeavor (maybe babies should be spared the magic of moviemaking), but it has a defined spirit that carries the adventure from beginning to end, stopping occasionally to assess character motivations and explore the romance between Toxie and Sara. Horrible, and I mean horrible stuff happens in """"The Toxic Avenger,"""" but rarely does the effort sit around and wallow in ugliness, always on to the next bit of awful it can manipulate into horror and comedy.Herz and Kaufman serve up quite a buffet of incidents in the feature, challenging screenwriter Joe Ritter to piece together a coherent take on a superhero origin story (he almost succeeds too). There's Bozo and his points-based system of hit-and-run homicide, Mayor Belgoody and his panic to bring down Toxie and preserve his comfortable way of life, and the general activity within the health club, which is apparently a haven for public humiliations, drug dealing, and sauna masturbation experiences. """"The Toxic Avenger"""" is dusted with cocaine, soaked in blood, and teeming with excess, reaching its zenith with a mid-movie showdown set in a taco restaurant, where Toxie busts up a robbery, removing arms and deep-frying hands in the process of cleaning up criminal filth (another crook is turned into a human milkshake). If there's any scene that highlights the functional marriage of sick and silly, it's this confrontation. The production also fills """"The Toxic Avenger"""" with impressive stunt work, with bodies crashing into cars, jumping out of buildings, and set ablaze, generating an impressive smashmouth tone of surprise as this low-budget picture manufactures a few honest thrills during its run time. There's unexpected bigness to the effort, an accomplishment that extends to make-up work, which is credible considering limited resources, and brain-squishing sequences supply their intended ick.""",GKK_Doc1_TheToxicAvenger,GKK,Horror,Positive,The toxic avenger
162,GKK_Doc2_TheToxicAvenger,"""The Toxic Avenger is one of the most important films in independent cinema, and without it there would have been no Lord Of The Rings as we know it. Peter Jackson (only one of Hollywood's major directors who admits to be influenced by Toxie, filmstudio Troma and director Lloyd Kaufman) would never have made his earlier horror-flicks which made him famous enough to be chosen to direct this much too expensive series. The Toxic Avenger may have influenced many directors, it has never quite been surpassed in its originality and brilliance, which is even more surprising if you take into account that it was made for the budget of Christopher Lee's breakfast on the set of Lot. R. Lloyd Kaufman is a genius, and his films are trendsetting, innovative and completely original. The Toxic Avenger is the one that put his (and Michael Herz's) film company Troma on the map and they still survive as a truly independent studio after 30 years, in spite of increasingly below-the-belt practices of the Major Conglomerates who don't really like to have any competition of someone who actually has ORIGINAL IDEAS. Besides Disney, Troma is the only filmcompany in the world that has a legion of fans who follow the Brand in itself. And such a thing can only happen if that brand has proven to be responsible for a continuous string of very special, innovating and high-quality products.This release is a deserved tribute to one of Horrorfilm's icons. The Toxic Avenger turns 21 this month, and with three sequels to his name he is still more alive than he has ever been. Besides a wonderful TROMAMORPHIC widescreen presentation of the film (that has never looked better) this set offers hours of very interesting bonus-material. There is a brand new Audio Commentary. Kaufman's commentary tracks are always an attraction of their own, and this one is certainly no exception. With his unique sense of humor, sharp analysis and immense know-how of making films he offers a highly entertaining, funny and informative commentary that in some cases can even be seen as an extension to his Make Your Own Damn Movie-instructions. The fist disc also offers very interesting recent interviews with a great number of the original stars of the film, seven deleted scenes, the intro and outro from the original Laser Disc release and an updated 45 minute film showing highlights of many Troma and Toxie-appearances on festivals and other occasions around the world in """"Where in the world is Toxie"""". And even though this first disc is more than worth the price alone, there is a second dvd in this set with some fantastic stuff. There are fan-submissions offering a number of very interesting reminiscences, hommages and short films of surprising quality that need to be checked out, unique scenes from the successfull theatrical musical TOXIC AVENGER: THE MUSIKILL musical, original trailers for all toxic avenger films, trailers for other Troma-releases and much more Tromatic information. Another disc that would be interesting enough and worth the low price of the entire set. This is the ultimate release of this very important film. A MUST BUY for thos who haven't yet seen the film. A HAVE-TO-GET for anyone who is familiar with the film but still does not have the title in their collection, but also a GOTTA-GET-IT-TODAY for those who already have the film, as this presentation is much better than ever before, and it offers a load of highly entertaining, infomative and not-to-be-missed extra's that is unheard-of, especially on such an affordable release. It's from Troma. Of Course!""",GKK_Doc2_TheToxicAvenger,GKK,Horror,Positive,The toxic avenger
163,GKK_Doc3_TheToxicAvenger,"""For those that don't know, there are intentionally """"bad"""" movies, and then there are intentionally bad movies; """"The Toxic Avenger"""" is the latter. Troma Entertainment is the undisputed king of bad b-pictures, but the 1985 cult hit """"The Toxic Avenger"""" ranks as their finest effort. Essentially a take on superhero movies and sci-fi pictures, """"The Toxic Avenger"""" is Troma's """"Citizen Kane."""" With co-directors Michael Herz and Lloyd Kaufman at the helm, respective veep and president of Troma Entertainment, """"The Toxic Avenger"""" begins with a humiliating prank gone horribly wrong. Melvin, the resident 90-pound geek and janitor of the Tromaville health club, is fooled into thinking a blonde bimbo wants him. But instead the prank, which involves a stuffed goat and pink tutu (don't ask), goes wrong and ends with Melvin diving out a second-story window and landing in a vat of misplaced toxic waste.What emerges from the bubbly green goop is Tromaville, New Jersey's hideously deformed, bloodthirsty vigilante mutant monstrosity who sets out on a vendetta against all forms of evil in his hometown, particularly against the jocks (who are too sick to be believable) who made him what he is. Meanwhile, Toxie eventually finds romance with a blind woman who is unaware her boyfriend is responsible for the recent wave of gruesome vigilante killings (in essence, they're the perfect couple).A sick and depraved sense of humor is flaunted throughout this low-budget film project, which is in itself (to the politically-correct), an inspired, mean-spirited, overtly racist, funny, and completely, utterly insane cult flick that also reveals a slight penchant for animal cruelty.The acting is atrocious, the gore is plentiful and the low budget shines, but there's no question I loved this flick. Like any horror film, it's rightfully found its place in this film lover's heart.Vote for Citizen Toxie in 2006! The Toxic Avenger is probably one of the best cult movies of its time and of course it brought Troma to life in every way possible. When I heard that this movie was coming out on DVD again and it was put in widescreen quality I thought """"That's cool. Maybe they'll remaster it and give it a new digital makeover!"""" Man was I fooled. The 21st Anniversary edition packaging was cool but I played both the new one and the old one. The old one had a transfer that was way way better than the new one and the widescreen format didn't make much of a difference to the movie (than again Troma never did good transfers to their movies, but the original DVD of this movie has a way better transfer). The fullscreen transfer actually had a wider reach than the widescreen version. The extras on the new one are not much better than on the old one. even though it did include most of the stuff on the original version, some of the stuff on the original version was more helpful on the behind the scenes look to the movie. The new one showed mainly fans recreating classic scenes from the movie and the commentary track is different; the one on the original is way more informative. If you don't own the movie the two-disc version is at a cheap price but the original DVD release is cheaper and is definitely the better one to have. Me, being a big fan of Troma, I did enjoy the movie, and I own the original DVD release. If you people are planning on upgrading to the 21st Anniversary Edition, you may be a little disappointed. I still give this movie a 5-star rating for the movie and for the original DVD release. But beware, as I say again, you may be disappointed with the new DVD release. I'd say only the elite die-hard fans will want the new version. I'm a die-hard fan but I'm perfectly happy with the original version. But the movie passes with flying colors.

164,GKK_Doc4_TheToxicAvenger,"""The character that helped build Troma in to the company we know and love it as today, is still a wonderful and fun anti-hero who finds himself dropped in to fateï¿½s door after a mean prank pulled on him one day. In Tromaville New Jersey, Melvin is a young janitor for a local health club dominated by a pair of muscle bound bullies. By day, the bullies roam around the club taunting Melvin and hanging around with their busty girlfriends, but by night theyï¿½re vicious hit and run murderers that take joy in killing children and helpless animals. After Melvin accidentally runs afoul one of the bullies, his girlfriend invites Melvin to a private rendezvous on the condition he wear a pink tutu. After realizing heï¿½s been the victim of a prank, Melvin crashes through a window and falls in to a drum of toxic ooze. Disfigured and transformed in to the muscle bound Toxic Avenger, he roams the streets of Tromaville murdering criminals and rapists, and laying down the law with his handy mop. Despite the very low budget, ï¿½The Toxic Avengerï¿½ works as a simultaneous superhero action tale and monster movie. A lot like ï¿½Robocop,ï¿½ Tromaï¿½s superhero gets the job done in the most violent manner possible. Michael Herz and Lloyd Kaufman are never above being as splatterific as possible, showing off a ton of gruesome moments including Toxie taking off a thugï¿½s nose, and tearing anotherï¿½s arm clean off. Of course a lot of the movie doesnï¿½t reserve the grue for the bad guys, eliciting genuine cringe inducing moment when Melvin is turned in to the Toxic Avenger. Even for an indie film in 1984, the sight of Melvinï¿½s skin pulsing and bulging from the toxic waste is grotesque and you hate to see such a goofy protagonist be reduced to this monster. Toxie is kept in the dark for most of his introduction, as he begins feeling his way around his strengths and weaknesses, and realizing his mutation allows him a chance to fight evil. He begins to take on the bigger nemesis when he realizes the local police force is run by a corrupt chief and his sergeant whose attitude is very Nazi like. Herz and Kaufman give Toxie some time to even fall in love with a beautiful blond girl, and do battle with the villains from the gym. ï¿½The Toxic Avengerï¿½ is still a fun and off the wall action horror movie with its own twist on the superhero sub-genre. Leave it to Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz to take typical superhero tropes and twist in to something wonderfully gruesome and absurd. This film is a classic with some really great comedy and gory scenes in it. Only be sure to get the US Director's cut release because that is uncut while the UK release is edited for violence. The US Director's cut is also region free which means that it will play on your DVD player or games console with no problems. On top of that it also includes lots of cool extras from Troma so if you're a fan of Troma then this will be an essential purchase. All in all a really awesome movie that is certainly not for kids unlike the old TV series. This movie is great, I remember watching it with my friends when we were younger and would have a great time.""",GKK_Doc4_TheToxicAvenger,GKK,Horror,Positive,The toxic avenger
165,GKK_Doc5_TheToxicAvenger,"""As a child I loved to stay up late and watch """"USA Up All Night"""" (with Gilbert Gottfried or Rhonda Shear, I wasn't picky). This allowed me to sample pretty much every major Troma movie, and I discovered the meaning of the phrase """"guilty pleasure"""". As I got older I stayed away from Troma, as their movies radiated the kind of feeling you get from wearing a shoddy Halloween mask too long and getting nauseous inhaling the cheap rubber fumes. But after sampling the delightful """"Tromeo & Juliet"""" I decided to return to my roots and check out the directors edition of the classic """"Toxic Avenger"""". While I was right in remembering the films as the guiltiest of pleasure, the cheap charm of the film was undeniable, and there was a ton of gore in the movie that I never saw on T.V. Arms are severed, guts are ripped out, seeing-eye dogs are shot, and children's heads are crushed- and it all looks pretty good! Some of the acting will make you wince, some of the jokes are atrocious (there are mother-in-law jokes), and some scenes go on too long (the idiotic out-of-control-car sequence) or too short (Toxie taking his revenge on his tormenters is strangely gore-free, which is explained in the director's commentary), but I can't bad-mouth a movie that has it's hero stuff a little old lady in a washing machine. If you're a gore fan with a high thresh hold for bad taste, then give the Toxic Avenger another shot- I did, and I'm a better person for it. I think.The Toxic Avenger (1985) was the flagship of Troma's movie line during the early to mid 80's. This film was responsible for keeping the company a float during this time period and it also marked a turning point in the company's history. For years, Lloyd Kaufman and company were making cheesy sex comedies. With the birth of the Toxic Avenger, they started to expand their horizons, focusing on low budget horror/comedy trashy spoofs films. Instant cult classics were being produced by Team Troma. The Toxic Avenger is a Charles Atlas tale gone a wry. A weak nerd is transformed into a superhero of """"superhuman size and strength."""" Melvin Junko is his name. Melvin was a mop boy for a local health spa. One day when a mean prank turned into a horrible accident, he was exposed to an open drum of toxic waste. That unfortunate mishap transforms and mutates Melvin into an avenger, a TOXIC AVENGER. Troma becomes a worldwide phenomenon and the Toxic Avenger becomes one of the most famous cult films of all time. A must for all campy cult film fans!! Highly recommended!""",GKK_Doc5_TheToxicAvenger,GKK,Horror,Positive,The toxic avenger
166,GKK_Doc6_TheToxicAvenger,"""From the production value, the acting, the direction, the annoying way in which the production company treats itself and it's audience, """"The Toxic Avenger"""" may very well be the worst movie in the history of the Universe. Which is a rather dubious distinction considering """"The Thin Red Line"""", and """"Keeping the Faith"""" have been released in this time continuum. The plot is fairly simple...Some dweeb works at a gym. People at the gym are mean to him. People at the gym pull practical joke on dweeb. Joke goes horribly wrong, and the dweeb is disfigured. Disfigured, the dweeb gets his revenge on the """"mean people"""", and ends up with a girl (I'd say """"the girl"""", but the girl, in this movie, was just some contrived plot device). The only plot twist is that the people who are deservedly mean to the dweeb (the dweeb is the sort of person anyone would pick on), are sadistic murders, who wantonly commit vehicular homicide during the evening, and are so blatantly bigoted, the Republican party will inevitably adopt them as their mascots in the not-too-distant-future. But strangely enough, this film, which for all intents and purposes should never have been made, actually turns out almost watchable. The gratuitous sex draws in the teenage viewer with their raging hormones, and the very explicit violence draws in the connoisseurï¿½s of violence, such as myself, who are always looking for the next """"Evil Dead."""" While this movie is nowhere near as good as the """"Evil dead"""", it is a comedy in the same vein as the ED. While bigoted hipster's, murdering defenceless children may seem repugnant, the way it is filmed, just seems so absurd, it actually becomes rather comical (the """"head crushing"""" scene for instance). And the contrived romance between toxie and the blind chick is a very predictable plot twist, but it is acceptable, and does continue character development in some sense. The only way in which a movie like this can get worse is if the producers insult their audience, by taking themself seriously. On the DVD extra's, the producers go into full """"kayfabe"""" mode (to borrow a wrestling term), and totally insult the audience by acting as if the Toxic Avenger is a legitimate person, and the movie was just some sort of adaptation of the Toxic Avenger's life. A segment like that just insults the audience, and will in all probability just repel viewers...Pretentious DVD documentary aside, this is a below average movie, definitely worth at least one look (especially if you're a fan of gratuitous violence such as myself), but don't go in expecting """"Scarface"""" or a """"Godfather"""" type of movie (you know, movie's people actually consider good), or you'll be very disappointed. The best comparison I can come up for this movie is the """"Evil Dead"""", just not as polished, and just not as good... Yes, I kinda relied on 100 positive reviews and wasted my money. The positive about this flick is there is plenty of skin and then some political backgrounds. The negative is the producer couldnt find his way in this mess called USA. Happy ending didnt prove anything either and, basically, movie is done for specific audience with IQ below 50.

167,GKK_Doc7_TheToxicAvenger,"""This is the movie that made Troma Films what it is today ï¿½ and remarkably, its creators escaped prosecution. Prior to this film, Troma had specialized in soft-core porn, which this effort resembles with its bad lighting, bad acting, bad scripting, gratuitous sex scenes and ï¿½ worst of all ï¿½ nonstop porno-movie musical score. But the addition of horror, lots of blood and gore, and total irreverence for anything you care to name hit a nerve and changed Tromaï¿½s fortunes. While the movie is still outrageous today ï¿½ especially in the unrated directorï¿½s cut ï¿½ itï¿½s the sort of thing thatï¿½s been done so much that itï¿½s hard to understand completely its original appeal. It helps if you take a look at the state of movies at the time. By the mid-1980s just about anything edgy came from the lower-rungs of exploitation filmmaking ï¿½ and this was especially true of works that took a swipe at political corruption and hypocritical morality. This made it the perfect time for The Toxic Avengerï¿½s take-no-prisoners attitude. Sure, itï¿½s a silly, tasteless movie with a plot only a schlockmeister could love. Essentially, itï¿½s the story of nerdy janitor Melvin (Mark Torgl), who falls into a barrel of toxic waste when a practical joke goes wrong. From this he emerges as the Toxic Avenger (Mitchell Cohen), who cleans up the corrupt town of Tromaville and has his revenge on his earlier tormentors. Itï¿½s your basic nerd revenge fantasy, only decked out in gore and over-the-top, bad-taste gags. The political incorrectness and hilariously crummy acting found in """"The Toxic Avenger"""" give it its few instances of humor, but its constant mean-spiritedness, grotesque violence, shoddy filmmaking, dull plotting and overall trashiness make it hard to enjoy. B movies can be good when handled with just the right amount of restraint and silliness, but """"The Toxic Avenger"""" is just too much of an ugly thing. For what this film is, it's brilliant, but I use that word very lightly. """"The Toxic Avenger"""" is a disgusting romp with great practical effects (at times), and a wacky take on the anti-hero genre. I must say that I had a great time watching this film, but the on-the-nose cheese get's a little repetitive. Sometimes it feels intentional and other times it feels as though the writers thought this idea would work so well that they got cocky. After a nerd falls into a vad of toxic waste, he slowly transforms into something so gross that the town is terrified of him, although he means well. Falling in love with a blind woman, saving the town, and just having a weird feel to the movie all around, this is one of the most odd films I have ever seen. That is a compliment for this film though, as that is exactly what it was trying to be.

168,GKK_Doc8_TheToxicAvenger,"""The Toxic Avenger'' is a monstrously crude, blatantly tasteless film reminiscent of the now bygone drive-in movies. It`s also sterling evidence of why they haven`t been missed. Wimpy Melvin (Mark Torgl)--one of the most ludicrous nerd takeoffs yet --is a goofy, dim-witted, unattractive mop boy at the health club in fictitious Tromaville. On the job, he`s victimized around the clock by the imaginatively nasty hoodlums who seem to make up this town, punks who get their kicks by beating up old ladies and engaging in hit-and-run auto sprees conducted on innocent children. Eventually, their shenanigans result in Melvin`s being tossed into a sizzling green vat of toxic waste. That transforms him into a hideously ugly, hulklike superman who spends the rest of the movie saving innocents and avenging himself on the type of bad boys who taunted him for so long. The great taco restaurant scene tells it all. A trio of robbers rush into the eatery, where they shoot a man in the chest and then rape a blind girl after gunning down her seeing-eye dog. Melvin comes to the rescue: He rips the arm off one punk, covers the face of another with an ice cream sundae before grinding the guy`s head into a shake machine drill and then shoves the third villain`s hands into a sizzling basket of french fry grease. We get to ponder all the bloody, gory, seared-flesh results. Obviously, these independent filmmakers are being deliberately bad themselves. They have what might be called an esthetic vision. There`s a lot of satire going on, of superhero movies and goody-goody nuke attitudes and, because the blind girl becomes the Avenger`s love interest, of mawkish romance stories between the sweet and the ugly. And, like the cult films they emulate, they`re trying to drive us into new septic tanks of tasteless violence. But John Waters and Tobe Hooper in their day at least served to shake us out of middle class complacency. ''The Toxic Avenger'' merely seems to succeed at reaching a new gross-me-out level. The acting and technical ineptness--the dialogue in many scenes is crudely dubbed--keeps the picture from earning even the most rudimentary kind of respect. There isn`t, in the end, any point of view conveyed here except a highly amateur one. I`ve never been big on art having to be moral. Certainly, moral issues are intrinsic components of fiction, but, as Henry James said, the final moral requirement is that a story be interesting. But the sole purpose behind ''The Toxic Avenger'' seems to be to reduce adults to giggling, squealing junior high schoolers again, a form of retentiveness that has nothing to do with remembering cherished cinema. One doesn`t have to have moral aspirations or pretentions to want a better way to spend time than that.""",GKK_Doc8_TheToxicAvenger,GKK,Horror,Negative,The toxic avenger

So many points for someone on a bike, so many points for an elderly person, and big points for a small child. """"How many points for a child on a bike?"""" asks the driver, excited. Learning this will earn him maximum points, he proceeds to knock the small child off his bike, and he goes flying over the hood. They turn round and see the child move in pain. Horrified that he may lose out on his points, the driver then proceeds to reverse over the child's head, squashing it completely. Two girls get out of the car and take some pictures. This scene, for me, represents the majority of this film. More shocking than it should be, even today, but never taking itself at all too seriously, regardless of the horror on show. Melvin (Mark Torgl) is a skinny, nerdy loser who works in the swimming baths, forever cleaning up with his mop. He is frequently bullied and humiliated by a high school gang who one day play a trick on him, which sees him kissing a goat dressed in a tutu. Horrified, Melvin flees and throws himself through a window, landing on a conveniently positioned (and open-topped) barrel of toxic waste. He begins to burn and rot, and eventually the toxic waste causes him to mutate in a taller, stronger, and ultimately more heroic beast, who wants revenge on his tormentors. Toxie (as he is now called, played by man-mountain Mitch Cohen) starts to clean up the city of Tromaville, which is being run by corrupt mayor Peter Belgoody (Pay Ryan), while at the same time romancing blind girl Sara (Andree Maranda) who he rescues from a rapist in a restaurant. This was Troma's first big hit, and also their first foray into horror, having previously focusing on really crap sex comedies. After this, which after an initial unsuccessful run became a popular cult favourite on the B-movie circuit, they focuses only on horrors. This is the second Troma film I've seen. The other was Killer Nerd. You can probably assume from the title that it is a god-awful excuse for a film, although it is quite amusing in it's filmed-on-video awfulness (starring Harvey Pekar associate Toby Radloff). This, I'm pleased to say, was actually good! It was a hell of a lot more violent than I was expecting, and the special effects are actually pretty impressive in some places. And Toxie proves to be a likable vigilante/superhero, however hideous he may be. Having said that, this is a low-budget Troma, and it's not exactly Citizen Kane. The acting is wooden, and the film is so 80's you can practically reach out and feel the sweatbands and mullets. But it is funny, satisfyingly gory, and, most importantly, fun. Toxie proves to be a more interesting 'superhero' than the majority of others. And the film actually has a social message in there somewhere, beneath all the tits and human-taco-making, recognising the pollution that we are all too aware of in our age of global warming and climate change.

Itï¿½s Troma, so you sort of know what to expect, and this one has many of the hallmarks of the studio ï¿½ itï¿½s silly, itï¿½s overblown, thereï¿½s a lot of sex and nudity and the characters lean into the stereotypes of the time. I want to say this one is harmless fun, but I donï¿½t think this one has aged terribly well, and some of the language and terminology in here did make me wince. The costume for Toxie himself is pretty laughable, even for early 80s Troma, and while there are a few funny moments some of it just winds up feeling a bit too try-hard to really land as the directors might have pictured. This one was obviously a success in its own way, spawning no less than three sequels, not to mention the cartoon and even a couple of video games (do I need to do a Game Gutter or something?) but for me it doesnï¿½t rank as my favourite Troma offering. It might be the one that launched the studio into the big time in relative terms ï¿½ it certainly got a much larger following than any of their late 70s and early 80s titles ï¿½ but thereï¿½s not much here that will live long in the memory for me personally. Suppose that explains why I forgot most of it from the first watchï¿½ RATING: 3/10. To be honest, if you loved lots of other Troma films, itï¿½s going to be good youï¿½ll get something out of this one. But this one never quite clicked with me, and on the rewatch it feels like time has rather moved on past poor old Toxie and the rest of the crew here. Some horror movies (and even horror comedies) can age like a fine wine, but this one feels as though itï¿½s turned a little toxic instead. Thereï¿½s better Troma out there for me, even though the company might not exist in the form we know it without this oneï¿½s success, so I suppose that has to count something towards this one!""",GKK_Doc10_TheToxicAvenger,GKK,Horror,Negative,The toxic avenger
171,RPD_Doc1_Us,"""Us, Jordan Peeleï¿½s follow up to his excellent Oscar-winning debut Get Out, is a go-for-broke ambitious mess of a film. I found myself thinking Peeleï¿½s two films are akin to Ridley Scottï¿½s Alien and Prometheus; the former is a fresh, thematically-rich and chilling horror film with a simple-yet-terrifying premise (both Get Out and Alien are riffs on the haunted house trope) while the latter is just batshit crazy in the best possible way. Itï¿½s as if Peele had a big brainstorming session with a smorgasbord of ideas, then decided to include every single one of them in Us. Us opens with a traumatic childhood event for Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyongï¿½o): in 1986, on the Santa Cruz beachfront, she wandered away from her parents for 15 minutes into an abandoned house of mirrors and saw a girl that looked exactly like her. Fast forward to a few decades later, and the adult Adelaide is headed to Santa Cruz again, this time with her husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and her two children, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex). A typical upper-class suburban family, they head to their beach house to relax and unwind. They meet up with their uppity wealthy friends, Kitty (Elisabeth Moss) and Josh (Tim Heidecker) and their twin teenage daughters, Becca and Lindsey (Cali and Noelle Sheldon). When Jason briefly disappears at the beachï¿½coincidentally in the same carnival house of mirrors from Adelaideï¿½s pastï¿½and witnesses a strange figure standing with arms outstretched on the sand, it leaves Adelaide deeply unsettled. When darkness falls, Us turns into a home invasion film with a twist: the four red-jumpsuit-clad invaders standing out on the driveway are exact doppelgï¿½ngers of the Wilson family. Let by the mother, Red (also played by Nyongï¿½o), the new familyï¿½s movements and demeanor are decidedly off and creepy; their stiff-yet-swift movements, unblinking stares, and deadly sharp golden scissors are all quite intimidating. When the two families are finally face to face, Gabe asks the question on everyoneï¿½s mind: ï¿½Who are you people?ï¿½ To which Red calmly responds: ï¿½Weï¿½re Americans.ï¿½ Now, in my UK theatre, this line elicited a huge uproar of laughter. Indeed, Us is darkly hilarious, a genuine comedy as much as a horror film, and I laughed quite a bit throughout the final half. Though gruesomely violent at times, Us is not particularly scary, mostly due to the pacing and shot placement. Peele chooses to show us quite a bit of Red and her family (as well as other, future invaders), opting for an unsettled feeling rather than jump scares or outright dread and terror. If you simply accept its ridiculous premise and allow the jokes to set the tone, Us is quite a bit of wacky horrific fun. Metaphors work well when theyï¿½re simple. This is not to say that there is a one-to-one correspondence of meaning, a This=That formulaï¿½true metaphors can elicit a polyvalence of legitimate interpretations and ideasï¿½but rather that the symbol or sign doesnï¿½t require huge explantations to discern its meaning and significance. This is especially true for horror; keep it simple, smart, and scary, and the symbolism will work wonders. This is precisely why Get Out worked so well: the Sunken Place was about white supremacy and racism, sure, but it was also about so much more than thatï¿½capitalism, classism, modern aesthetics, sexuality and gender, police and security, even social media. It kept us talking about the problems in our nation, the things that make us uncomfortable or angry, the beliefs and systems which are both ubiquitous and oppressive. Us gets us talking about how and why the doppelgï¿½ngers eat bunnies. Which is fine. Horror filmsï¿½or any films for that matterï¿½donï¿½t have to be philosophically rigorous or culturally stimulating to be good art or entertainment. The problem is that Us wants to tease us with all its supposed symbolism, to provoke us to ask why? even as the film doesnï¿½t really care about offering a coherent answer or making a sensible statement on The Way Things Are. Us is about capitalism, politics, ideology, racism, classism, sexism, religion, bunnies, California, boating, bunnies, Black Flag, still more bunnies, the ï¿½Hands Across Americaï¿½ event of 1986, the weird culture of beachfront theme parks, Michael Jacksonï¿½s Thriller, Cartesian dualism, the fashion faux pas of wearing Crocs, and the peril of running with scissors. Itï¿½s also about the Bible. A grungy drifter carrying a cardboard sign with ï¿½Jeremiah 11:11ï¿½ is a repeated image, albeit itï¿½s difficult to discern how this is important to the events in the narrative (though I imagine itï¿½ll make folks look up the verse after the film). In a climactic, balletic confrontation between Adelaide and Redï¿½a beautiful sequence where image, sound, and performances all come together in cinematic perfection, a moment which is perhaps one of my favorite scenes Iï¿½ve ever seen in a horror filmï¿½the doppelgï¿½nger tells her twin in a De Palma-esque split diopter shot that it was God who brought them together back in 1986. I donï¿½t know what God has to do with any of this; Iï¿½m not sure Peele quite knows (or cares) either. The final ï¿½twistï¿½ is so obvious and such a cheat to the entire earlier narrative that it undermines any potential message or meaning Peele might be attempting to communicate. In short, Us (both the film and the nation) is kind of a big silly mess which makes little coherent sense, yet I feel a certain fondness for it. Maybe I canï¿½t help it; Iï¿½m American.""",RPD_Doc1_Us,RPD,Horror,Negative,Us
172,RPD_Doc2_Us,"""In 1986, while visiting Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk with her parents, young Adelaide (Madison Curry) experiences a traumatic event that affects much of her childhood. Several decades later, an adult Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyongï¿½o) now has a family of her own. Her husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and children Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex) are all excited for a vacation at the familyï¿½s beach house, but Adelaide remains apprehensive. Several ominous coincidences convince the overprotective mother that someone wishes to bring harm to her loved ones. And her fears are confirmed when a quartet of menacing doppelgï¿½ngers appear on their driveway that night ï¿½ holding hands and grasping golden shears.The seemingly insignificant actions of a girl watching television, choosing a prize at a carnival, and walking along a beach are all steeped in normalcy. But with producer/writer/director Jordan Peele (ï¿½Get Outï¿½) at the helm, thereï¿½s an unmistakable eeriness even in these mundane activities. When young Adelaide wanders off on her own, no foreshadowing is necessary; sheï¿½s certain to meet some terrible ï¿½ or life-altering ï¿½ fate. In these initial moments, the building of tension is masterly; even without the inexplicable bravery often seen in horror pictures, Peele knows how to play with audience expectations. During several introductory scenes, nothing much happens at all, yet the feelings of dread continue to escalate. A perfectly commonplace, perhaps unusually happy family enjoying the serenity of a summer vacation has never felt so nerve-wracking.The camera employs long, uncomfortable, lingering shots on faces and environments, further intensifying the unease, as if waiting to catch an inevitable, shocking happening. And when viewers are denied the customary jump scares (there are still a few in routine places), itï¿½s all the more effective. The manipulation is high, but it never feels cheap, overwrought, or hard-won.Also at Peeleï¿½s disposal are hallucinatory flashbacks (often including purposeful inaccuracies or abrupt cuts), mirrors and unforeseen reflections, repetitive imagery and symbols, reappearing locations and characters, sudden noises and movement, and some superbly dismaying music (by Michael Abels). Additionally, his script contains generous servings of comedy, oftentimes relieving tension so noticeably that it takes a few minutes to dive back into the terror. But the humor is largely appropriate, complementing the supernatural elements; Duke, in particular, presents a rational reaction to the appearance of strangers outside their home, which nicely contrasts Adelaideï¿½s unchecked paranoia. Itï¿½s actually a wise idea to have the primary protagonist contend with the bulk of the fears alone, isolating her from the comforts of reasonable disbelief. ï¿½Weï¿½re having so many crazy coincidences lately.ï¿½As the film explores facing inner demons, an us vs. them mentality, notions of two sides to every person, perverse concepts of duality and identity, and the oppressed turning tables on the oppressors (audiences accustomed to ï¿½Get Outï¿½sï¿½ more observable social commentary will surely ponder and dissect the layers of this multifaceted work), the psychological thrills become absolutely exhilarating. The villains are freakishly formidable, with complex, cryptic motives, combining the home invasion chills of ï¿½Funny Gamesï¿½ and ï¿½The Strangersï¿½ with the preternatural incidents of ï¿½Annihilationï¿½ or even ï¿½Silent Hill.ï¿½ ï¿½Usï¿½ works best when the setting is intimate and the terrorizing is restricted to the Wilson family; sadly, toward the conclusion, the scope grows too big, allowing the metaphors, a literal descent into madness, and the logistics of the doubles to disintegrate. Too much hinges on the ultimate revelations, causing the explanations to shift into the realm of fantasy; as each piece of the mystery is unearthed, less and less makes sense. Nevertheless, ï¿½Usï¿½ is a technical marvel, looking and feeling exceptionally disturbing. And it certainly helps that the cast is first-rate, while the cinematography, framing, and editing all sensationally contribute to the supremely disconcerting ordeals.""",RPD_Doc2_Us,RPD,Horror,Negative,Us
173,RPD_Doc3_Us,"""They say lightning doesnï¿½t strike twice, but sometimes it does with hit movies. Ridley Scott followed up his superb The Duellists ï¿½ which won best first feature at the 1977 Cannes Film Festival ï¿½ with seminal sci-fi hit Alien two years later, scoring a special effects Oscar for its chest-bursting menace. Quentin Tarantino topped Reservoir Dogs with Pulp Fiction. So I was pumped for Jordan Peeleï¿½s much-hyped sophomore feature Us about a family menaced by stab-happy doppelgangers, after his exhilarating, Oscar-winning debut Get Out smartly rewired the horror genre, lancing rampant racism and creeping white privilege. Sadly his flash of brilliance totally fizzles this time. A genuinely unnerving set up in a 1986 fairground totally gets the creak of terror lurking in these places, with a wide-eyed Madison Curry as a young girl attacked by her evil double after being lost in a funhouse mirror hall. Positing another clever metaphor, with Americans as their own worst enemy, Peele soon loses focus. Jumping to the present, a goofy but overlong section sets up Black Panther duo Lupita Nyongï¿½o and Winston Duke as a married couple taking a break in their wood-surrounded holiday cabin (never a good idea in horror films) with their kids, played by Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex. Taking too long to get there, Peele flubs an oddly inert home invasion when the familyï¿½s maniacal scissor-wielding mirror images eventually show up. Basic jump scares abound, but thereï¿½s no real terror. We do get a much more brutal attack on the neighbours, including The Handmaidï¿½s Taleï¿½s Elisabeth Moss, but a re-run is a re-run. The filmï¿½s laborious pace is further hampered by Nyongï¿½oï¿½s bad reflection setting out their terms in the worst asthmatic wheezing committed to film since Tom Hardyï¿½s much-memed Bane. Peele manages to bury the film in a turgid cement of tedious exposition while still leaving the basic world-building foundations decidedly wobbly. Get Out already joked about villains monologuing their dastardly plan. Pushing the same punchline here is just lazy. The patchy humour fares a bit better as the ï¿½goodï¿½ family gets increasingly violent in their fight back, but itï¿½s so on the nose it literally references Home Alone. Yeah, we got it.Pop culture call-outs galore, including an iconic line ripped from the Star Wars saga, only serve to highlight the dearth of new ideas herewith Peele borrowing liberally from better films like The Shining, it ends up feeling like a tired rehash. Speaking of which, Iï¿½m not going to die and be resurrected on a hill claiming the probably unnecessary Pet Sematary reboot is a masterpiece, but it at least has more fun re-animating Stephen Kingï¿½s zombie cat story with a zippier pace. Directed by Kevin Kï¿½lsch and Dennis Widmyer, the movie doesnï¿½t give Jason Clarke quite enough space to really work the crazed grief of a father tortured by a devastating accident, but thereï¿½s just enough here to hurt. Tinkering with the tragic 1983 novel and the 1989 movie adaptation, it delivers a couple of surprises more welcome than un-dead family members at the door.""",RPD_Doc3_Us,RPD,Horror,Negative,Us
174,RPD_Doc4_Us,"""Is it fair to say that Jordan Peele is this generationï¿½s John Carpenter? With his sly grasp of the intersection of popcorn thrills and political allegory, itï¿½s a reasonable comparison. After he provided an Oscar-worthy analysis of race relations in Get Out, now Americaï¿½s id is probed in Us. The Wilson family is as atomic as they come. Mother Adelaide (Lupita Nyongï¿½o), father Gabe (Winston Duke), teen daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph), and son Jason (Evan Alex) are a nice, middle-class family taking a summer vacation in Santa Cruz ï¿½ a fine idea, except, as an opening flashback shows, Adelaide has some unpleasant memories of the resort city after a bizarre trip into an amusement park. Still, she puts them aside to spend some time on the beach with their drunken friends, the Tylers (Tim Heidecker and SXSW 2019 MVP Elisabeth Moss). All seems well until they return to their summer home, where four figures ï¿½ a family: two parents, two kids ï¿½ suddenly appear in their driveway. These others are skittering, shuddering, degraded copies of the Wilsons, and their assault on the family is an hour-long nightmare. Peele ratchets up the tension in extraordinary fashion, but most especially in the dual performances his cast creates. Each iteration of the family is an inversion and a perversion, and the different forms of malice they portray and the different fears they invoke in their originals are hooks in the eyes. Yet for all that, thereï¿½s a catch: Us is excellence of execution ï¿½ or rather, the best version imaginable of a script that feels underdone, and occasionally overwrought. The revelation of what drives these simulacra verges on trite and depends on (no kidding) a Hands Across America reference, an obscure enough event that it seems like quicksand rather than a firm foundation for a script. Thereï¿½s a literal third-act descent down the rabbit hole, and this comes after a line earlier that is so on-the-nose that in lesser hands it would cause laughter. But Peele is not lesser hands, and the home invasion that dominates the middle hour is nerve wracking and taut (in fact, it probably should be taught, too, alongside Youï¿½re Next, The Strangers, and Assassination Nation as case studies of how to keep the genre from going stale). If that act is his Assault on Precinct 13 (to revive the Carpenter comparison), then Nyongï¿½o is his Adrienne Barbeau while Duke is his Kurt Russell, all cocksure masculinity undercut by panicky self-doubt and underlined by exquisite comedic timing. So while itï¿½s true that Peele may well be the new Carpenter (just as heï¿½s trying to fill Rod Serlingï¿½s smoke cloud in his revamp of The Twilight Zone), itï¿½s still not unfair to say that his latest metaphorical horror ï¿½ while far from a sophomore slump ï¿½ lacks the seamless elegance of his debut. ï¿½Not quite matching a masterpieceï¿½ is still high praise, but Us is a step forward for Peele the Filmmaker, and a step back for Peele the Storyteller.""",RPD_Doc4_Us,RPD,Horror,Negative,Us
175,RPD_Doc5_Us,"""ï¿½Us,ï¿½ Jordan Peeleï¿½s eagerly anticipated follow-up to his smash hit ï¿½Get Out,ï¿½ canï¿½t help but be compared with that earlier movie. As a politically minded genre exercise combining horror and humor, itï¿½s utterly of a piece with Peeleï¿½s obvious fascination with cinematic grammar at its most ritualized and predictable, and what happens when you give it a swift kick in the social conscience.In ï¿½Get Out,ï¿½ Peele created a creepy, eerily effective reality-adjacent world in which racial animus and envy played out against ï¿½Stepfordï¿½-like perfection. In ï¿½Us,ï¿½ the setting is a more recognizable present-day America, in which a happy, well-adjusted family is thrust into existential battle with mysterious, suddenly ubiquitous forces. Lupita Nyongï¿½o and Winston Duke play Adelaide and Gabe Wilson, who with their kids Zora and Jason (Shahadi Wright Joseph, Evan Alex) plan to spend a week or two at the family beach house in Santa Cruz, Calif. Gabe and the kids are excited ï¿½ he just bought a boat and they canï¿½t wait to hit the beach ï¿½ but Addie is bothered by a creeping sense of unease she canï¿½t shake, even when they meet up with their friends Josh and Kitty (Tim Heidecker, Elisabeth Moss). Usually a luminous, delicate presence on-screen, Nyongï¿½o here is hooded and wary, her jumpy movements and mistrustful glances darting out from under a curtain of twisted ringlets in her hair. Her entire physicality is one of worry and foreboding, an air of impending doom that is telegraphed by a man carrying a ï¿½Jeremiah 11:11ï¿½ sign in the filmï¿½s disquieting prologue. Thanks to that opening sequence, a flashback to a traumatic event in Addieï¿½s youth, viewers have a dim sense of whatï¿½s bugging her. But it isnï¿½t until four strangers invade the Wilsonsï¿½ cozy getaway that the truth is revealed. Taking a page from ï¿½The Invasion of the Body Snatchersï¿½ here and the current ï¿½Purgeï¿½ franchise there, Peele creates a tense, terror-filled domestic drama that becomes more brutal and bone-shattering as its life-and-death story unravels. As in ï¿½Get Out,ï¿½ he proves as adept with goofy jokes as in stoking fear. In ï¿½Us,ï¿½ however, the balance is far more in favor of blood and gore, with the humor showing up as brief, albeit sharply effective, trace elements. All by way of saying that the audienceï¿½s enjoyment of ï¿½Usï¿½ is far more dependent on their love of scary movies than on pointed satire, which ï¿½Get Outï¿½ blended with such elegant finesse. Peele still wants to work out serious ideas in this movie ï¿½ about inequality, materialism, envy and disenfranchisement ï¿½ but theyï¿½re far more bluntly expressed. Both simplistic and overcomplicated, ï¿½Usï¿½ depends on some of horrorï¿½s most hackneyed cliches and gaps in logic ï¿½ by now, shouldnï¿½t all movie characters know never to go back into the house and to always stay together? ï¿½ as well as a few windy speeches explaining why bizarre things keep happening. The viewer begins to wish that Peele had given his script one more pass, either to pare it down or beef it up. As it stands, ï¿½Usï¿½ turns out to be an uneven, if intriguing, affair, one that engages a current pop culture interest in doubles (ï¿½Orphan Black,ï¿½ ï¿½Counterpartï¿½) and parallel universes (ï¿½Westworldï¿½). Peele loads his movie with recurring motifs, not only in the form of that biblical quote, but also spiders and rabbits (so many rabbits). The symbolism is far from the most interesting thing about the film, though, and it ultimately collapses under the metaphorical weight.Much more compelling are the performances, which are consistently excellent throughout ï¿½Us,ï¿½ from Dukeï¿½s bearish sweetness to Moss and Heideckerï¿½s hammily enjoyable turn as a bickering couple from hell. One of the filmï¿½s chief weaknesses is that there isnï¿½t more interaction between the two couples. But itï¿½s Nyongï¿½o who is most memorable and astonishing in ï¿½Us,ï¿½ delivering a strange, mannered performance whose weirdest details become clearly motivated once Addieï¿½s complicated history comes to light. Watchful one moment, monstrous the next. Nyongï¿½o is a force of nature throughout a film that suggests the doppel-apocalypse is right under our collective nose. testament to Peeleï¿½s ability to illuminate the deepest and most dangerous shadow material of the American Dream.""",RPD_Doc5_Us,RPD,Horror,Negative,Us

In every meaning of the expression, the Wilsons are not alone. Everyone in town appears to have a double who wears a red jumpsuit and wields an unusually large pair of scissors. ï¿½Usï¿½ produces the effect of punching the solar plexus while jolting the frontal lobe and, sometimes, provoking laughter. In other words, it scared the bejesus out of me while giving me time to reflect on why I was so scared, and left me breathless from that sock in the gut and the occasional belly laugh, so that I didnï¿½t know whether my screams were of terror or laughter. As with most effective horror films, the pace here is alternately snail-slow and lightning-bolt abrupt. Peeleï¿½s weighty film stands on the slim shoulders of Nyongï¿½o, whose parallel performances as both the survivor of a childhood trauma and her spectral look-alike are respectively poignant and primal. As the ineffectual husband, Dukeï¿½s purpose is to provide the kind of comic relief perfected by the director in his work as one half of Comedy Centralï¿½s ï¿½Key & Peele.ï¿½ At times, Duke seems like heï¿½s in another movieï¿½not to mention another universe. Yet there are moments when his dead-eye comic spin and Nyongï¿½oï¿½s dead-serious riposte make for something tonally fresh. Whoï¿½or whatï¿½are the invaders? They are unlike those in the 1956 version of ï¿½Body Snatchers,ï¿½ out to replace the bodies of individualist Americans with those of groupthink Soviets. The new invaders literally and figuratively are shadow images of those above, rising from abandoned train lines underneath the Santa Cruz boardwalk. ï¿½They look like some effed-up performance art,ï¿½ one character says.

177,RPD_Doc7_Us,"""There is a passage in Stephen Kingï¿½s Misery in which the protagonist, a best-selling novelist who is to some extent a double for King himself, explains the difference between Getting an Idea and Trying to Have an Idea. Itï¿½s the difference between inspiration and perspiration; between a concept so ingenious it all but writes itself and the more exhaustive process of chipping away at a big chunk of creative block until it resembles something else. I thought about these distinctions while watching Jordan Peeleï¿½s new thriller Us, which feels very much like the work of a filmmaker Trying to Have an Idea, or, more specifically, trying to have an idea as good as his last one. With Get Out, the director hit upon a premise so simple and audacious that the movie attached to it proceeded immediately into the canon. Itï¿½s not just that Peele came up with the metaphor of the Sunken Place, but that he seemed to be operating from somewhere equally deep and primal, channeling something oceanic from the collective unconscious and distilling it through a fine-grained filter of comedy and social commentary. Get Out wasnï¿½t flawless, but it was major; in its best moments, it made viewers feel the helpless, bottomless undertow of a nightmare. Us is a more skillful and technically virtuosic piece of work than Get Out, which was thriftily produced around its priceless high concept. Emboldened by a dizzyingly high return on investment and an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, Peele now gives off the signs of an artist feeling himself. His increased command of horror-movie rhythms and conventions is supplemented by a greater willingness to mess with them. He continues to demonstrate a knack for integrating shock and humor; he understands that one can heighten the other. And yet for all of its choked, breathless atmosphere, satisfyingly gratuitous gore, and strategically deployed symbolismï¿½a dense weave including ominous Bible verses, Hands Across America, creepy carnival rides, enigmatic rabbits, and insinuating vintage hip-hop cues (the Luniz revival starts here)ï¿½the film never achieves the startling dramatic or thematic clarity of its predecessor. The best horror movies impart a sense of reality shedding its skin to reveal what lies beneath. With Us, itï¿½s as if Peele is determined to keep adding layers instead of stripping them away. By now, you probably know the basic setup of Us, which is about a fateful family trip to a seaside holiday townï¿½or actually, in the spirit of the filmï¿½s obsession with doubling, two trips, 30 years apart. What links them is the presence of Adelaide, played as a child by Madison Curry and as a grown-up by Lupita Nyongï¿½o; the adult incarnation has more screen time, but the filmï¿½s power and tension derives from the impression left by the younger version. In a superbly scary prologue that lowers the temperature even on Get Outï¿½s chilling cold open, we see Adelaide wander away from her parents on a Santa Cruz boardwalk and enter a hall of mirrors, where she encounters something uncanny amid the panoply of distorted reflections: a doppelganger trapped behind (or is it within?) the glass. Here, Peele takes several well-worn clichï¿½sï¿½a dark, deserted house, an isolated child, an evil twinï¿½and exploits them for maximum effect while still cultivating a sense of mystery. Not only are we left in the dark (literally) about what, exactly, happens to Adelaide, the why is left hanging as well, and not just for the audience. More than 30 years later, sheï¿½s equally haunted by the memory and unsure of its meaning, internalizing her anxiety and keeping it secret from her husband, Gabe (Winston Duke), high-school-age daughter, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph), and young son, Jason (Evan Alex). Returning to the scene of the crimeï¿½or whatever it is that happenedï¿½as a wife and mother, she reverts to the tentative, wide-eyed demeanor of a frightened child. We wonder whether weï¿½re watching a story about a woman at the mercy of her own trauma and whether whatever sheï¿½s got bottled up inside is about to come bursting to the surface in a dangerous way. It does and it doesnï¿½t: Adelaide isnï¿½t the monster lurking in the shadows outside their cottage, but at the same time, she is. Given what the filmï¿½s trailers show, itï¿½s not a spoiler to reveal that, approximately half an hour into Us, the main characters are confronted with bizarro versions of themselves, cladï¿½Donï¿½t Look Nowï¿½styleï¿½in institutional red jumpsuits and seemingly determined to terrorize, torture, murder, and supplant their opposite numbers. The extended set piece in which the doubles first appear conjures memories of other home-invasion thrillers from The Strangers to Funny Games, yet weï¿½re still fully discombobulated, both by how quickly the film seems to be revealing its gimmick and the outrageousness of Nyongï¿½oï¿½s second performance as Adelaideï¿½s opposite number, all quick, feral movements and dead-eyed stares, topped off by a voice that turns every line of dialogue into a strained incantation. The situation is visually arresting, psychologically unsettling, and completely surreal, and then Peele tries to lower the boom. ï¿½Who are you people?ï¿½ asks Gabe. ï¿½We are Americans,ï¿½ replies the other Adelaide, whoï¿½s known as Red, and weï¿½re off to the races, allegorically speaking. You donï¿½t have to be a clever film critic to note the double entendre of the filmï¿½s title, in which Us can easily be reworked into ï¿½U.S.,ï¿½ and you donï¿½t have to follow that particular trail of semiotic bread crumbs to enjoy a movie that, from that moment forward, plays out, on the most basic level, as a straightforward and satisfying jolt machine, with our heroes battling their doubles while also gradually coming to terms with a larger catastrophe unfolding across the entire community. ï¿½Us is a horror movie,ï¿½ Peele tweeted a few weeks ago, kidding the controversy over Get Outï¿½s scoring Golden Globe nominations in the Best Motion Pictureï¿½Musical or Comedy category while also trying to get out ahead of reviewers who might try to elevate his movie into something more pretentious than that. PR-wise, it was a good move, but if critics or audiences end up overthinking Us instead of just enjoying it, itï¿½s only because theyï¿½re following Peeleï¿½s lead, starting with that short, blunt line of dialogue, which instantly shifts the filmï¿½s emphasis from the personal to the political, suggesting a country divided between its everyday citizenry and a shadowy faction trying to take its place at the table. In interviews about Get Out, Peele admitted that after the election of Donald Trump, he just didnï¿½t have the heart to stick with his scriptï¿½s original ending, which saw Daniel Kaluuyaï¿½s Chris incarcerated for the murder of the Armitage family. Itï¿½s too bad, too: By presenting prison as a variation on the Sunken Place, Peele was paying off his scriptï¿½s central metaphor and honoring a tradition of bleakness inaugurated by the coda of George A. Romeroï¿½s Night of the Living Dead (a finale evoked directly by the staging of Get Outï¿½s climax). One way to read the complex subtext of Us, with its vague but unmistakable intimations of a culture war between haves and have-nots, is as a nihilistic corrective to Get Outï¿½s relative optimismï¿½as a sign that Peele has gotten that much more ï¿½serious.ï¿½ At the same time, in trying to go that much further, Us shows palpable signs of fatigue, especially in a third act that comes heavily overburdened with exposition. The issue isnï¿½t just that the explanations Peele offers about what Nyongï¿½oï¿½s monstrous twin calls ï¿½the Tetheringï¿½ are fussy and convoluted in ways that Get Outï¿½s bizarre, hilarious instructional video about the ï¿½Coagulaï¿½ was not, but that heï¿½s so insistent on explaining in the first place, as if he doesnï¿½t want anybody to miss out on the big ideas heï¿½s so evidently been trying to have.The paradox is that the larger Us gets, the broader it goes with both the history and implications of the ï¿½Tethering,ï¿½ and the more it tries to fill out the potential national allegory suggested by that ï¿½we are Americansï¿½ one-liner, the more it shrinks and starts to feel self-contained, even in its vagueness. Similarly, the more we learn about Adelaide and her doppleganger, the less unnerving the prologueï¿½s vision of an unexpected encounter with the self becomes, although thatï¿½s no fault of Nyongï¿½o, who plays the hell out of both roles, leveraging Adelaideï¿½s hellacious, protective maternal resourcefulness against the vacant but calculating cruelty of her other self and finding vivid, provocative points of crossover in addition to the obvious physical and behavioral contrasts. The other actors are all strong as well, with Duke putting a witty spin on the archetype of the hipster dad and Tim Heidecker and Elisabeth Moss contributing expert Caucasian caricatures as an unhappy couple staying a little farther down the shore, who, as it turns out, are no less implicated in whatï¿½s going on than Adelaide and her family.Coming out of the screening, a friend said that Us would probably seem better if Peeleï¿½s name wasnï¿½t on it, which is true enough and speaks to the difficulty of following up a classic. Iï¿½d also probably have liked Usï¿½s striking, slow-burn final image more if I didnï¿½t suspect that itï¿½s been partially lifted from a recent, critically acclaimed American thriller (hint: itï¿½s directed by Karyn Kusama and is set mostly at a dinner party) or if the Godï¿½s-eye widescreen grandeur of the composition felt earned rather than imposed. In an interview with The Ringerï¿½s Sean Fennessey, Peele called Us ï¿½a bit of a Rorschach,ï¿½ and yet I think a mirror ultimately is a better analogy. Not because of what it is so obviously trying to reflect and refract about its particular time and place, but because its mix of skill and strain compels us to work almost as hard as Peele to Try to Have an Idea about what it all means. Ideally, watching Us, weï¿½d see ourselves, and some viewers may well have those moments of recognition. What I see is a talented guy going for broke and, for better and for worse, getting there.""",RPD_Doc7_Us,RPD,Horror,Positive,Us
178,RPD_Doc8_Us,"""The underclass is coming to destroy us, and we will deserve it. That is the simple, overarching message of Jordan Peeleï¿½s witty meta-horror film, Us. The ï¿½usï¿½ he aligns viewers with is a middle-class American family of four, the Wilsons, and ï¿½theyï¿½ are their doppelgangers. The disenfranchised doubles have been living somewhere mysterious, cut off from the comforts of society. This other mother, father and two children appear one night in the Wilsonsï¿½ driveway wearing blood-red jumpsuits and wielding large golden scissors, the better to slice up their counterparts. Class warfare has rarely broken out with such frightening panache.  Despite the filmï¿½s veneer of a social theme, Us is different from and less inventive than Get Out, Peeleï¿½s amazing debut as writer and director. That film was a scathing critique of racial assumptions and stereotyping, cloaked in comic-horror. Us reverses the formula, and works best as a smart, intricately structured take on that genre, with a message that is plain but never deep. Peele is masterful at the horror part, though. Playfully using classic tropes of the genre while channelling primal fears, Us can make you laugh and cower at once.  The film starts slowly, which allows Peele to drop clues about whatï¿½s to come. Us is full of small visual touches and references meant to lure viewers back again and again to find more. In the opening scene, set in 1986, the camera zones in on a television commercial promoting Hands Across America, a real event in which  people across the country joined hands to raise money for the hungry and homeless. Anyone who has seen the filmï¿½s trailer will instantly spot the resemblance between the eventï¿½s logo ï¿½ a row of red cut-out figures, like paper dolls ï¿½ and the red jumpsuited doppelgangers. Other references are more obscure. A homeless man with stringy blonde hair holds a sign that says Jeremiah 11:11. He recurs through the film, but Peele leaves it to viewers to go home and look up the Biblical reference on his sign. (It is chilling.) He is first seen as a theme park, where a small girl wanders into a funhouse hall of mirrors. A sign there reads: ï¿½Vision Quest: Find Yourself,ï¿½ and thatï¿½s exactly what she finds. Little Adelaide spots her doppelganger, and is terrified from that day on. When the film leaps to the present, Adelaide is Lupita Nyongï¿½o, married to Gabe Wilson (Winston Duke), who adds comic relief as a sometimes oblivious guy who tells bad dad jokes. Their teenage daughter, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph), is always on her phone. Their younger child, Jason (Evan Alex) unaccountably wears a mask on top of his head. They are at the family beach house, conveniently near to the scene of Adelaideï¿½s childhood trauma.The action picks up when the doubles invade the house. Each of the actors has a dual role, and Peele has directed them with such nuance that the slight differences ï¿½ the doppelgangersï¿½ faces remain still no matter how violent they become ï¿½ are more alarming than exact duplicates might have been. The film centres around Nyongï¿½o, whose performance as the double is especially eerie. Her voice is croaky and halting, as if she has not spoken in years, as she resentfully tells a story about a girl who ï¿½had a shadowï¿½. That girl was a princess who found her prince and a happy life, while the shadow was hungry and living in the dark. Joseph brilliantly displays the creepy look on her face as Zoraï¿½s evil counterpart. Like Nyongï¿½oï¿½s, her doubleï¿½s physical movements are as swift and pouncing as an animalï¿½s. The family fights off the invaders in scenes that Peele creates with sleek precision. They try to escape by boat and by car. Adelaide thwacks the Others with a fireplace poker ï¿½ always strangely close at hand in horror films. There are stabbings with scissors, evoking Hitchcock. The melodramatic music cues, calling attention to danger in the style of old movies, signal that Us is a meta-layer removed from those hokey films, that the urge to yell, ï¿½Donï¿½t go down that dark road alone!ï¿½ is a trick Peele has knowingly set up. Even as the scenes become a bloody mess, the film is always lucid, cutting from wide shots of corpses to suspenseful angles seen from the besieged family membersï¿½ points of view.  Peele keeps ramping up the intensity of the action, but then the film takes an unexpected, spectacular stylistic turn. As we come close to understanding the secret behind Adelaideï¿½s funhouse encounter, the film becomes more imagistic, almost surreal. The music is thumping and modern, and we see young Adelaide and her double dancing in ballet classes. Those scenes bring the film Black Swan to mind, rather than slasher movies. The sequence is a revelation, evidence that Peele can be an exceptional film-maker in an entirely different mode. Even though Us leans into its genre, social issues linger as subtext. The Wilsons are black, but their race is not addressed as an issue. The exception is a scene in which Gabe confronts the doubles in the driveway and deliberately changes his grammar to sound thuggish, using the image of the threatening black man as a ploy. Even then, the film leaves it to viewers to infer the comment on racial stereotyping. Peele himself has been blunt about how the film deals with America. ï¿½This country, and how this country looks at the world, we have a fear of the outsider,ï¿½ he has said, describing his theme. ï¿½No one really wants to look at their faults, their guilt, their demons.ï¿½ By the end, Hands Across America, a well-intentioned event, has been subverted into a symbol of evil. The most chilling lesson from Us: you just might be your own evil twin.""",RPD_Doc8_Us,RPD,Horror,Positive,Us
179,RPD_Doc9_Us,"""Most of Jordan Peeleï¿½s new movie, ï¿½Us,ï¿½ is set in and around Santa Cruz. The town is as warm as Amity, in ï¿½Jawsï¿½ (1975), and you have to go back to ï¿½The Birdsï¿½ (1963) to see such enthusiastic gulls. Hither comes a happy family, the Wilsons, who have a summer home not far awayï¿½a calm and bucolic spot, beside a lake. Gabe (Winston Duke) is bespectacled and easygoing; his wife, Adelaide, or Addie (Lupita Nyongï¿½o), finds the going a little harder, but runs a steady ship. They have two children, a teen-age girl named Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph), who prefers the company of her smartphone, and her younger brother, Jason (Evan Alex), who likes to wear a mask, as if every day were Halloween. What the Wilsons encounter, in the course of the plot, is harrowing and outlandish, but they have too many wits to be frightened out of them, and itï¿½s the very normality of the family that sees them through. If Pixar made an animated version of ï¿½Us,ï¿½ it would be called ï¿½The Credibles.ï¿½ One day, Gabe wants to go to the beach, but Addie is none too keen, and we know why. The movie has a prelude, set in 1986, when Addie, as an inquisitive girl (Madison Curry), went to the amusement park at Santa Cruz Beach, with her parents, and wandered off, bearing a candy apple like a beacon. Alone, she entered one of the attractions, which bore the legend ï¿½Find Yourself,ï¿½ and walked into a wilderness of mirrors. There, as forewarned, she found herself, reflected all too well. Why she has never told Gabe about this incident and why, despite its lingering effects, she now agrees to head back to the beach with him and the kids is hard to grasp. People as smart as Addie do foolish things, of course, but thereï¿½s more at stake here. Can she not stay away from the scene of the trauma? Did part of her never leave? Mirrors abound in ï¿½Us,ï¿½ as do doublings and repetitions. Even white rabbits hop into the action, just to make clear that, like Alice, we can slip to and fro through the looking-glass. Well before the tale turns nasty, appearances shift and deceive; at the beach, the Wilsons meet up with family friends, the Tylers, and Kitty Tyler (Elisabeth Moss), who is seldom without a drink, admits to having had work done on her face. ï¿½You look just like you did last year,ï¿½ Addie says. ï¿½Thatï¿½s the idea,ï¿½ Kitty replies. Later, when the Wilsons are back at the house, Addie confides to Gabe, ï¿½I donï¿½t feel like myself.ï¿½ He reassures her, but, with the descent of night, you can feel the fear of unselvingï¿½of being or becoming someone otherï¿½beginning to take hold. It makes a kind of grim sense, therefore, when another family appears in the driveway. There are four of them, two adults and two children. Although they wear red jumpsuits, like the astronauts at the end of ï¿½Close Encounters of the Third Kindï¿½ (1977), they are flying nowhere. They are here to remain. They break in, bearing scissors, and bring nothing but trouble, yet thatï¿½s not the worst thing about them. As they confront the Wilsons, eye to eye, Jason sizes up the intruders and declares, ï¿½Itï¿½s us.ï¿½ Heï¿½s right. They are played by the same actors, but with all the smooth edgesï¿½the contours of civilizationï¿½sawn off. The other Jason, for example, crawls very fast on all fours. The other Zora has a smile as curved as a sickle. The other Gabe roars and lumbers like a wounded bear. The only one who speaks is the other Addie, and her voice is gulping and hoarse, as though she were on her deathbed, drawing her final breath. Asked who she and her fellow-invaders are, she replies, ï¿½Weï¿½re Americans.ï¿½ That is the most frightening line in the film. It marks the point at which Peele, with great deliberation, steps beyond the confines of the horror flick. He did the same in ï¿½Get Outï¿½ (2017), but ï¿½Usï¿½ travels further and deeper, with a more resolute sense of adventure. The indictment of racial prejudice in the earlier movie was blistering stuff, but ï¿½Usï¿½ spares nobody, regardless of color, age, or creed. Briefly, we wonder if the Wilsonsï¿½well-to-do African-Americansï¿½have been singled out, yet soon we discover that the Tylers, too, are under siege from implacable look-alikes, and so is everyone else in Santa Cruz, and across the land, from sea to shining sea. (Observe, however, that most of the victims look economically stable; itï¿½s a terrible thought, but maybe the poor canï¿½t afford doppelgï¿½ngers.) The scarlet avengers turn out to have lurked beneath our feet, biding their time and waiting to emerge, like flowers of evil, into the sun. So, what the hell do these infernals want? That question has been posed ever since cinemas were pressed into service as cradles of dread, and some of the answers have been plain enough. Vampires want to drink us. Zombies want to eat us. Aliens want to reap us or, if theyï¿½re cute, to go home. Meanwhile, the pod people in ï¿½Invasion of the Body Snatchersï¿½ï¿½first in 1956 and then, with an added dash of humor from which Peele has learned, in 1978ï¿½morphed into us, mocking our social conformity and daring us to tell the difference between human simulacra and the real thing. The doubles in ï¿½Us,ï¿½ though, are a hundred times harsher, craving payback for having been tamped down. They represent the nationï¿½s id, or, in the profoundest sense, its underclass, and Marxists and Freudians alike will have years of fun with this movie. They will parse every glint in the fretful yet forthright performance of Lupita Nyongï¿½o, and thrill to the scene in which Zora, needing to mash the life out of her enemy, deploys not a gun or a knife but a golf putter. What better choice of weapon for the bourgeoisie? ï¿½Usï¿½ is political filmmaking of the most spirited sort, and it sets up quite a fight: the Hydes come to visit the Jekylls, and the Jekylls hit back. Whom you cheer for, in the long run, is up to you. In August, 2012, a sixteen-year-old girl was sexually assaulted in Steubenville, Ohio. Trent Mays and Maï¿½lik Richmond, two members of the Big Red football team, at Steubenville High School, were convicted of rape and served time in juvenile detention. Maysï¿½s sentence was longer, because he had sent images of the naked victim to friends; since the girl was underage, this amounted to the distribution of child pornography. The case, which brought global infamy on the town, is now revisited in a documentary, ï¿½Roll Red Roll,ï¿½ directed by Nancy Schwartzman. The title refers to the war cry of the football team, chanted during every game. The film is brief, at eighty minutes, and all the more potently wrathful for being so restrained. There is no narrator, the editing is anti-inflammatory, and most of the folks who are interviewed seem sorrowful and stunned. Only once is the anger unloosed, in the opening credits, when Amenï¿½s ï¿½Coma Americaï¿½ is played at such a volume that it sounds like a scream. Many viewers, I suspect, will wish that Schwartzman had played it again at the end. At the core of the Steubenville story was a clash of the agelessly old and the dauntingly new. A moral stronghold that Hawthorne would have recognized, in which male dominance was suffered, feared, and largely tucked away, exploded into fragments. Alexandria Goddard, a crime blogger in Columbus, unearthed and made public the social-media activity of the accused and their friends. Technology allowed, or emboldened, Mays to crow over his fell deeds, but it also trapped him. It led countless people to offer the victim their compassionate support, both online and at rallies in the town, while others chose to shame and to blame her, as squarely as if they had pinned an ï¿½Aï¿½ï¿½a big red, by any standardï¿½to her chest. In Schwartzmanï¿½s film, the screen is often crowded with other screens, as we read the messages that wing back and forth in the wake of the attack. ï¿½Are you gonna do everything you can for me?ï¿½ Mays pleads with his victim. As if he were the one who needed saving. Even if youï¿½re steeped in the saga of Steubenville, the film contains plenty to appall you afresh. There is the video that was found by Anonymous, the group of campaigning hackers (ï¿½We do not forgive and we do not forgetï¿½), and posted online just before Christmas, 2012. What we see on the footage is not the assault itself, thank heaven, but the response that it triggers in other boys when they see photographs of it, shortly afterward, and pass comment on the victim. ï¿½She is so raped right now.ï¿½ ï¿½Sheï¿½s deader than O.J.ï¿½s wife.ï¿½ ï¿½They raped her harder than that cop raped Marsellus Wallace in ï¿½Pulp Fiction.ï¿½ ï¿½ Note how their Dionysian glee is stoked by popular culture. And yet, however repugnant you find them, and however firmly you believe that they should be punished for their sins, thereï¿½s a problem. Not all sins are illegal. Marianne Hemmeter, the lead special prosecutor for the Ohio Attorney Generalï¿½s office, tells us that the video ï¿½does shock your conscience, but itï¿½s not a crime.ï¿½ If ï¿½Roll Red Rollï¿½ feels raw and pressing, six and a half years after the event, thatï¿½s because it is set on one of the worldï¿½s most contested borders: the place where online justice meets, and chafes against, the due process of the law. Expect worse battles to come.""",RPD_Doc9_Us,RPD,Horror,Positive,Us
180,RPD_Doc10_Us,"""Watching a Jordan Peele film is a uniquely unsettling experience. This is not just because ï¿½Get Out,ï¿½ his brilliant debut, and now ï¿½Us,ï¿½ are smart-and-scary horror movies. It is also because, after all the clues he dropped like so many breadcrumbs in ï¿½Get Out,ï¿½ you cannot simply sit back and watch ï¿½Us.ï¿½ You find yourself endlessly searching for hints, for tidbits, for the at-first-glance throwaway image that ultimately will unlock the secrets of the story. Itï¿½s relentless ï¿½ and itï¿½s thrilling. Which is not to say that ï¿½Usï¿½ is the equal of ï¿½Get Out.ï¿½ Few films are. But ï¿½Usï¿½ is a strong film in its own right, a sign of Peeleï¿½s confidence as a filmmaker (here he tackles class division, in a different way than he did racism in ï¿½Get Outï¿½). Itï¿½s also a sign that we can be confident heï¿½ll make us think while making us squirm. And maybe scream a little. Usï¿½ begins in 1986, at night at a carnival on the boardwalk on the beach in Santa Cruz, California. A little girl wanders from her father, who is drinking beer and playing Whac-A-Mole. She walks almost trance-like to the beach, and winds up in a fun-house, hall-of-mirrors-type attraction. Lost inside, she sees something that will haunt her for the rest of her life (and eventually haunt the audience). Then weï¿½re in the present, with the girl, Adelaide (Lupita Nyongï¿½o) grown up, married to Gabe (Winston Duke), with a daughter, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and son Jason (Evan Alex). Theyï¿½re on the way to their summer home in ï¿½ Santa Cruz. (If cinematographer Mike Gioulakisï¿½ overhead shot of the family driving to their vacation isnï¿½t meant to evoke the opening of Stanley Kubrickï¿½s ï¿½The Shining,ï¿½ itï¿½s a happy accident.). Adelaide really doesnï¿½t want to go to the beach, but Gabe, an amiable goof, talks her into it. They meet their friends Josh and Kitty (Tim Heidecker and Elisabeth Moss) and their twin daughters, a family just a little more well-off enough to bug Gabe. A couple of unusual things happen, enough to rattle Adelaide. Peele, who wrote and produced the film, in addition to directing it, periodically flashes back to the night in 1986 that so shaped her life. That night, the power goes out in their vacation home (Josh and Kitty have a backup generator, Gabe notes with annoyance), and Jason comes into his parentsï¿½ room with alarm: There is a family standing in their driveway. Itï¿½s not just any family; if youï¿½ve seen the trailer, you know that itï¿½s them, or their doppelgï¿½ngers. The film for a time becomes an exercise in home-invasion horror ï¿½ something at which Peele excels. (There are nods to several horror films here, recognizable but never overwhelming Peeleï¿½s unique vision.) There are many surprises to follow, and many more scares, but underlying everything is a message ï¿½ a warning, really ï¿½ pitting the haves vs. the have-nots, a class division that has broken out into full-on class warfare. The reasons for this grow a little fuzzy as Peele tries to explain things late in the game; that part of the film isnï¿½t entirely successful, though it certainly doesnï¿½t lack for ambition. The acting is fantastic ï¿½ playing dual roles is doubtless an actorï¿½s dream. But Nyongï¿½o is particularly outstanding. Peele relies on her to carry the film, both as a kind of action hero and her own worst enemy, and if youï¿½re looking for a message there, well, you can find one. Peeleï¿½s visual audacity is at times breathtaking, and always serves a greater purpose. There is a beautiful overhead shot of the family walking along the beach, carrying their supplies, casting long shadows. Thereï¿½s no way to know in the moment youï¿½re admiring this that it carries meaning that informs the rest of the film. Thatï¿½s just terrific filmmaking. And even if ï¿½Usï¿½ canï¿½t match the standard Peele set with ï¿½Get Out,ï¿½ itï¿½s another reason to be excited about whatever he comes up with next.""",RPD_Doc10_Us,RPD,Horror,Positive,Us
181,RBP_Doc1_Equilibrium,"I bought Equilibrium just because Christian Bale is in it. To tell you the truth I was certain that it was going to be a goofy, direct-to-video sci-fi fiasco that most involved would just as soon forget. The cover box reminded me of Universal Soldier. As it turns out however, it's not a movie that those involved want to forget, it's an overlooked gem, no doubt because it came at the height of the Matrix craze, which it may resemble in too many ways. Unfortunately, too many people will callously write it off as a Matrix rip-off, and it's a shame because this is one of the best science fiction films to have come along in quite some time. It takes place in the far off 21st century, but it's not about the future (given that it exists in a future that can't ever exist), it's about the disturbing reality that war is a part of human nature, and in order to eradicate it from the modern world we would have to become a homogenized society of emotionless, drug-controlled zombies. No jokes about that already being a reality. The movie's biggest assertion is that it assigns blame for man's inhumanity to man to his ability to feel (ignoring the real causes, such as religion, political power, and less dogmatic things like national pride and human rights). The current government is based on enforcing the mass removal of emotion from the masses using a drug called Prozium, and is the source of the movie's main irony, that in order to eradicate war, it has waged war on all of it's own citizens, who constantly live under close surveillance. The government employs Grammaton Clerics to handle that surveillance. They are highly trained officers authorized to kill anyone they deem to be ""sense offenders"" on the spot (""I trust you'll be more vigilant in the future?""). There is, in fact, a staggering amount of irony in the film, given that all emotion or feeling is strictly forbidden under penalty of death, and yet anger, suspicion and fear are all alive and well, and even flaunted. It's also interesting to consider that in real life it is the dogmatic, Cleric-like believers who aspire for war, and the normal people who just want to live their lives. For the most part the movie ignores the fact that it is governments that wage war, not citizens (even emotionally sensitive ones), but no matter. The important thing that you need to know about the movie is that it goes way, way too far, and because of that, it's fun. I cheered out loud several times during the film because the gun fights, which are so unrealistic it's almost funny, are genuinely well-choreographed and exciting. If I may say so, this is what gun fights in hard core science fiction movies should look like. Many people criticize the movie for being unrealistic or too extreme, altogether forgetting what kind of movie they're watching in the first place. The movie is not about moral dilemmas, even though the main character suffers a tremendous one, it's a fast, gritty science fiction movie that makes no apologies, and owes none. The characterization may be just a little heavy (Bale's character going from not understanding a question about what he felt when his wife was incinerated to having a soft spot for puppies, etc.), but like another outstanding and equally over-the-top film, Shoot 'Em Up, nothing is out of place. All of the excesses look right at home. It is interesting to consider the real-world implications of the content of the movie though, regardless of how unrealistic it is. The totalitarian regime, for example, resembles Mao Tse- tung's manner of oppression with startling closeness, even down to the children spying on and reporting their parents. Under Mao, children who reported their parents engaging in ""counter'-revolutionary activities"" were publicly hailed as national heroes while their parents were generally tortured and executed. Whether the crimes were real or not was unimportant, what mattered is that, as you can imagine, in a society where people were so easily made to desperately fear their own children, you can imagine the level of control the government (Mao) had over the people. Something similar happens in this movie. The similarities to The Matrix films are obvious, but limited mostly to superficial things like the fight scenes and some costumes. Thematically, the movies are totally different, and even with all of the similarities, this movie is more than able to stand on its own, and any similarities are more just an unfortunate bit of timing, as this is probably what caused the movie to be so overlooked. If you can't handle a little excess in the movies, definitely stay away from this one. But if you can watch a movie just for a good time, you could do a lot worse than this. Note: Keep your eye out for Dominic Purcell, Prison Break's Lincoln Burrows, in the opening scene. He should have had a bigger role in the movie.",RBP_Doc1_Equilibrium,RBP,Sci-Fi,Positive,Equilibrium
182,RBP_Doc2_Equilibrium,"A 9 out of 10 only for some budget deficiencies that show a bit. By all means skip the director commentary because its all whining about lack of funds. Understandable, but obnoxious to sit through. Let me just comment on a few things not much mentioned in the customer reviews. First, despite what's stated by many and even the IMDb plot summary, the population shown here is not drugged to the point of being ""emotionless"". People have to feel enough to care about family, obeying the rules, succeeding at their jobs, etc. Rather, the highs and lows of emotion have been chemically eliminated. Although this is taught from birth to be necessary for ""sense"" purity, the real reason is that it makes it easier for a repressive regime to stay in power and at least partially prevent rebellion. And for anyone who thinks the mass public attendance of televised political harangues is unrealistic, go rent ""Triumph of the Will"" by the chronicler of Nazi ascendancy, Leni Riefenstahl. And remind yourself that Hitler's adoring masses weren't even drugged. Second, although the drug is used to control emotions, its good old indoctrination that dictates behavior. The drugged state is reinforced by every mind control practice you can think of. Children are rewarded for ratting out parents, friends tattle on friends, etc. While the immediate reward is continued survival of the ratter at the expense of the rattee, you still get the sense that even children can feel some level of satisfaction in having earned brownie points, done their ""duty"", cleansed their family, whatever. Careful watching or re-watching of this movie shows that people around the edges of the main characters express flickers of emotion according to their job status, with those in more regular jobs having less rein on their responses. By contrast one key character is obviously off his meds, though some viewers seem to think this was either bad acting or some kind of continuity error. Actually its important to the plot. In a truly emotionless society no one would even bother to procreate or care for children. So even John Preston (Christian Bale) seems permitted to indicate a flicker of pride over his young son's acceptance into the cleric training school, which he expresses right in front of the most important boss he has. From what we see its only he and his fellow Grammaton Clerics who are trained to squelch their emotions entirely, as well they might since they are the cruel enforcement arm of their society's vicious goals. Third, Bale deserves a lot of credit for the way this movie succeeds. He does a wonderful job of making us care about a nearly-expressionless man who sets his own liberation in motion through one simple accident (or is it?) while brushing his teeth, a small personal cleansing that suggests bigger things are coming. He's soon slammed hard by emotions he's never been allowed to feel, emotions that both intrigue and frighten him and which he dare not express. Its almost worth the price of rental/purchase to see him play a man hearing his first music, or sitting and watching his children sleep late one night. Even as we realize he's feeling paternal love to a degree he's never felt it before, the fact remains he still can't show it and his kids can't know it or they'll turn him in. By the time he reviews a key event in his personal life, you can feel its horrific impact on him by the merest flicker of reaction on his face, and in the tiniest changes in body language. The tension between what he realizes and feels and what he dares to show builds to an agonizing sub-climax that sets the finale in motion. Fourth, the ironic different between what is expected of people in this dark future and how human nature really operates is used to great effect. Preston's special skill as a cleric is his ability to anticipate what lies beneath, what's behind the wall, what his quarry is thinking. In other words, to sense. This makes him suspect as well as valuable to his masters. The feeling of personal jeopardy builds wonderfully as he experiences more and struggles harderto hide it, particularly as he realizes his special mission is being scrutinized by his new partner. The best sci-fi is never about technology, the best martial arts movies are never about the fighting. The human heart may never have perfect equilibrium, and this quiet little classic of a movie sure never got its due in a limited theatrical release. But its worth your time and then some.",RBP_Doc2_Equilibrium,RBP,Sci-Fi,Positive,Equilibrium
183,RBP_Doc3_Equilibrium,"I won't hesitate to call this film a masterpiece! First of all, the premise is very original and brings up some interesting concepts. It's the 21st century, and all emotions have been outlawed. It sounds strange on the surface, but the society feels that emotions lead to conflict, which can lead to war and destruction. And having just finished World War 3, the society is fighting to make sure another war won't break out. Now, THIS is a sci-fi plot I can relate to. This actually sounds like something that may happen in the future. This is none of your ""Matrix"" or ""Star Wars Episode 1"" mumbo-jumbo. I don't mind sci-fi as a genre, but for me to really be connected to a film, it has to be based in reality. And just because a movie stretches the truth, doesn't mean it shouldn't contain any truth. The ""Matrix"" films aren't based in reality; they're based in some crackhead alternate universe where a whole bunch of wacky things happen and the movie tries to make sense of it with a lot of pretentious sci-fi jargon that only geeks of the genre will fully absorb. I don't have to be a sci-fi geek to understand ""Equilibrium."" Christian Bale gives one of the best performances in his career, and I really felt for his character and his struggle. There's also a great tension between his character and that of Taye Diggs, who envies his status as an officer. My favorite moment, which actually sent me to tears, was when the squad was sent to murder a large group of canines, and Bale becomes hesitant as he picks up one of the cute little puppies, and feels incredibly sympathetic towards it since he just started to feel emotion. And there's also a touching flashback, where his wife is arrested, yet he doesn't have any feelings about the event. And I didn't even get to the spectacular action sequences, which are bound to give the Wachowski Brothers a run for their money! The film was made on a low budget, so the effects aren't as high-tech as in ""The Matrix,"" but who said expensive effects make better action scenes? They're even better, since they don't depend highly on CGI. The scenes are so beautifully choreographed that I felt like I was watching a great John Woo film. But part of what made the scenes work was the fact that I fully sympathized with Bale's character and his goal to rebel against the society that's trying to put him and everyone else down. I also love the wonderful score, which at times sounds like the one from ""Broken Arrow""--which also worked wonderfully. Good films come more often than you assume, but great films don't. So I'm always proud to see a great film like this come along, and it's a damn shame that it didn't receive good distribution and probably made peanuts at the box office. Because this is a MUST-SEE!!! Screw ""The Matrix""! ""Equilibrium"" is sci-fi at its best.",RBP_Doc3_Equilibrium,RBP,Sci-Fi,Positive,Equilibrium
184,RBP_Doc4_Equilibrium,"I first saw the movie when my husband hollered for me to come see what he was watching. I was fascinated by the look and premise but didn't have time to watch just then. After finding out the next time it would play, I made a date with the television and watched it through. When it ended I bought the DVD online. That was two months ago and I have watched (or listened) to it at least 25 times since. My husband thinks I am crazy. Equilibrium does it match up to the Matrix? Well it didn't have as big of budget as the Matrix and it didn't makes as much money as the matrix but money doesn't necessary mean a movie is going to be good. Equilibrium is set in the future where everyone has to take a drug call equilibrium (it makes you have no feelings) so no one can be violent, happy, sad, mad etc. The person/people who don't take the drug are executed. The movie follows John Preston (Bale) as the bad guy turned good .The movie is slow to start but once it gets into it, it is pretty good. The cast is good and so is the story, so if you liked the matrix you won't be disappointed. This movie is under rated and is recommend. While that may be debatable, I have found the following to be true. One: The movie does not come even close to being anything like the Matrix. I was a Matrix (original movie, not the other two) fan. No more. The Matrix is now to me empty, void. The Matrix story left me cold. As it ended I said, ""big whoop"" and have never had a desire to see any of them again. There were NO emotional truths in any of the movies; they were technically sound. Two: Equilibrium, on the other hand, is a better movie than I think even the writer knows. Yes, there are some editing flaws, but I don't care. A small cost I gladly pay. Equilibrium. Wow. The emotional content is astounding. Hard actions taken in good faith that these are for the greater good, relationships based on air, wrong prices paid and regretted, inner conflict when an accepted and cherished way of life is being challenged, the acceptance of new realities and knowledge he was the deliver of horrible hurt. These are the things that have driven mankind for thousands of years in their own homes, communities, and nations. These things have not changed. This is not a ""political statement"" movie designed to change the world, as some limited thinkers have opined. Preston doesn't fall in love with Mary. It is only through her he connects to his slaughtered wife and mother of his children and realizes what he lost. Power seekers will always want the pretty things, the easy life, while forcing ugly, hard lives on those they rule. These are eternal truths that Mr. Wimmer has so simply and powerfully brought us. I thank him and the actors who, time after viewing time, have not lost their power and subtlety.

185,RBP_Doc5_Equilibrium,"Set in a future, post-World War III society where emotions have been outlawed, Equilibrium tells the story of John Preston (Christian Bale), a government agent who begins to have doubts about the policy he is enforcing. Equilibrium is the perfect example why I do not rate lower for derivativeness or unoriginality. The film is basically high-concept combination of Fahrenheit 451 (1966), George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (original published in 1949, film versions appeared in 1954, 1956 and 1984), The Matrix (1999) and a bit of The Wizard of Oz (1939) thrown in for good measure. What matters is not how original the ideas are (assuming it's not a case of plagiarism), as whether something is original or not is an epistemological problem that tells us more about our own familiarity with other material rather than the precedent status of the artwork we're questioning, but how well the material is handled. The high-concept material in Equilibrium is handled brilliantly. On its surface, after a brief action-oriented beginning, Equilibrium is basically a progression from a fairly complex sci-fi film (meaning simply that it takes a lot of exposition to get up to speed) to a thriller to a ""gun fu""-styled actioner. The progression is carried out deftly by writer/director Kurt Wimmer (who unfortunately hasn't shown the same level of elegant panache in other films I've seen from him, including Sphere (1998) and The Recruit (2003)), with all of the genres somewhat present throughout the film. Wimmer is so austerely slick here that Equilibrium sometimes resembles a postmodernist automobile commercial. The transition from genre to genre is incredibly smooth. The most impressive material on this surface level is the gun fu action stuff, which almost ""out-Matrixes"" The Matrix in style, if not volume. Preston is so skilled to be an almost invincible opponent. His solitary misstep as a fighter occurs once he gives himself over to emotion. This is nicely related to the common advice from kung fu senseis that emotion lessens one's effectiveness in combat. Of course a big part of Equilibrium is the set of philosophical points it has to make about emotion. There are sections of the film that are appropriately dialogue-heavy, and Wimmer is more than conspicuous with this (one of two) primary theme(s). Just as important as dialogue for Wimmer's commentary on man's emotions are body language and behavior. Some viewers might see it as a flaw that characters frequently show what they consider to be signs of emotions in their comments or behavior, but that's part of Wimmer's agenda. Because it's difficult to even say just what counts as an emotion, and emotions are so wrapped-up with being sentient beings, it would be difficult if not impossible to fully eliminate them, and it's certainly not recommendable. The cast does an excellent job of portraying characters who are supposed to be mostly emotionless but with cracks in the stoic armor continually poking through. Wimmer has a harsh view of our society's self-medication epidemic--even the title of the film seems to be a stab at the common claim that drugs like Prozac and Xanax are taken to help one ""smooth out"", or ""equalize"", extremes of mood, or extreme dispositions. The Equilibrium government extends this agenda into the tangible material realm as they also attempt to ""smooth out"" mood swings by eliminating any cultural artifacts that might promote varied moods/emotions. Wimmer seems to see it as a not-too-exaggerated extension of the modus operandi behind Prozac-like drugs. The other primary theme is one of institutional control. Wimmer has a lot to say about unquestioningly following authorities, and he's careful to show that it's not just governmental authorities that can be a problem. He does this by tightly wrapping religious allegory with his depiction of Equilibrium's government. The leader is known as ""Father"", and the government secret service members are ""clerics"". Those outside of this control are shown as authentic, free, individualistic and happy despite the hardships involved with their embrace of forbidden thought/items. More subtly, Wimmer employs the now overused washed out blue-gray cinematography of late 1990s/early 2000s genre films towards an unusual end. It's not just a stylistic device here, but represents a particular kind of reality. Under the purview of the fascistic government, blue-gray predominates. When glimpses of freedom/authenticity enter the film, the blue-gray look is gone, replaced with strongly saturated warm colors, and occasionally a more nostalgic subdued tone. This is one of the film's similarities to The Wizard of Oz, although maybe not the most significant one. If you're someone who cherishes originality for its own sake, you might not like Equilibrium as much, but you have much more serious epistemological problems to sort out. Otherwise, this is a film worth watching and thinking about.",RBP_Doc5_Equilibrium,RBP,Sci-Fi,Positive,Equilibrium
186,RBP_Doc6_Equilibrium,"Here's a true story: This evening, I went to see a movie called ""Equilibrium."" Now normally, I save every movie ticket and throw them in a shoebox filled with precious mementos. On my trip through the parking lot, I pulled out my Zippo and proceeded to burn it. Then proceeded to speed home, so I could take an extremely violent crap. I don't know what was worse; how painful the bowel movement was, or how painful the movie was. Roger Ebert gave this movie 3 stars out of 4. As soon as I'm done writing this review, I'm going to track him down and force-feed him his review. Laced with Strychnine. I realize you're probably thinking, ""Shouldn't the punishment fit the crime?"" But frankly, I'm a busy man, and I don't have time for 6 months of chakra torture. I suppose you're expecting some sort of review of the movie, so I guess I should make an attempt. Then again, if I put as much effort into this review as writer/director Kurt Wimmer put into his screenplay, I could call it a day right now. ""Equilibrium"" gives us a society, Libria, which is opiated by a drug known as Librium, a necessity after World War III. The survivors in power decided that it was man's emotion that led to war, and in order to prevent any such future occurrences, they constructed a society based on emotionless. This is aided by the destruction of all art, music, and cultural relics, not to mention 3 doses a day of the aforementioned Librium injection. Those who forsake the drug are known as ""Sense Offenders,"" and these criminals are tended to by an elite class of soldiers known as Clericks. And by ""tended to,"" I mean ""Terminated with extreme prejudice."" Within the first 20 minutes of the film, we've encountered Clerick John Preston, watched him kill his partner for being a sense offender, and discovered his wife was executed for Sense offenses 4 years earlier. But thanks to his Librium doses, he doesn't seem to mind much. Watching this movie, I suddenly wished they made a drug which made horrible movies good. All is well and good in emotionless Libria, until Preston accidentally knocks a vial of his Librium off the bathroom sink, and doesn't have time to pick up another dose. Suddenly, he is overwhelmed with emotion, and continues to abstain from his medication, leading him to question authority and rebel. And by ""rebel,"" I mean ""Terminate with extreme prejudice."" I suppose you're expecting me to say something along the lines of, ""At this point, the movie degenerates into a Matrix-wannabe."" Unfortunately, the movie was that from the moment Preston and his partner show up to tend to the first lot of sense offenders. Christian Bale was dripping with Keanuosity, from the slicked-back black hair, black garb, and generally emotionless acting ability. Although one would be hesitant to mention the dullness of his performance, given the fact he was on the drug, he was only on the drug for the first 20 minutes. After that, I would've expected him to suddenly become warm and likeable. Instead, he merely dives into his best Keanu Reeves impersonation and begins dealing with ludicrous amounts of heavily armed soldiers in his attempt to overthrow Libria's regime. And by ""dealing with,"" I mean, ""Terminating with extreme prejudice."" During the course of the movie, we are subjected to no less than 6 major gunfight scenes, not a single one of them memorable. The Clericks display incredible superhuman agility and strength, which would be fine if this was the Matrix, but this isn't. It's set in the future, in the real world, and yet we're supposed to digest the idea that humans can jump 20 feet into the air and dodge the bullets of 20 close-range gunman using ""statistical probability."" I suppose by now you're thinking to yourself, ""This movie sounds awful. I should go see it just for the cheese factor."" This is where I warn you that I saw the Transporter and the One, and I enjoyed both on a cheesy action movie level. I feel confident saying this movie makes abysmal blush. Gut-wrenchingly-awful could stand next to this movie and therefore look attractive in comparison. After seeing this movie, ritual seppuku seemed like a fun way to pass the time. This movie will be the low marks on the resumes of actors and actresses like Christian Bale, Taye Diggs, Sean Bean, and Emily Watson. Kurt Wimmer, whose visuals were forgettable and his screenplay full of clichÃ©s and attempts to rip off many other successful movies and books, will hopefully never write a screenplay again. And I sincerely hope the entire special effects team returns to throwing together low-budget effects for advertising, because Terminator 2 had more believable special effects. In short: Do not see this movie. Ever. If you see it on movie store shelves, run in the opposite direction screaming. If not for yourself, then at least for the children. Do it for the children.",RBP_Doc6_Equilibrium,RBP,Sci-Fi,Negative,Equilibrium
187,RBP_Doc7_Equilibrium,"In a not so distant future, so much civil unrest has broken out that it causes the Third World War. Exactly how this WW III has broken out is not discussed in the film. Probably it is some country in the so called Axis of Evil that has developed a nuclear warhead and started the war. The US never starts a nuclear war, except in WW II (although it has about 15000 warheads), it only finishes it. Perhaps it started as a pre-emptive attack or some simulated enemy attack like in the Tonkin bay in 1964. However, in the aftermath of this supposedly nuclear war, the rulers of the rising society have decreed that no such event should ever happen again (as they did after WWII) and administers a drug to eradicate all human emotions to end the anger and rage that threaten to devour the world. The result is an emotionless, drone like, media controlled society where everything even remotely cultural and emotionally stirring like records, books and paintings, should be destroyed. It has almost too much resemblance to George Orwell's '1984', Ray Bradbury's 'Fahrenheit 451' with a twist of Aldous Huxley's 'Brave New World' and the likes. This movie asks a lot of relevant questions about the present society that most users on this site live in. Rhetorically it seems to hold a black and white view that communism and dictatorship by nature creates all evil in the world, and that the occidental notion of democracy by the same logic is the sole Good counterweight to this evil. This is depicted by clips of Josef Stalin and Saddam Hussein with the complete absence of Eisenhower (the only world leader yet to deploy the nuclear bomb, twice) and Adolf Hitler who were both democratically elected. If this is a pointer to Kurt Wimmer's lack of historical knowledge or just a general view of the American public, is hard to say. But history has always been written by the winners and not the defeated. To make a film where the actors are not allowed to show any emotion is a difficult task, and here mr. Wimmer shoots wide of the target. In one scene, when the leader of the society known as The Father, makes a speech on a large television screen in front of the masses, he receives a standing ovation much like a State of the Nation speech from George W. Bush. The fact that this is taking place should hint of some sort of emotional backdrop, even though the standing ovation is as uncalled for as the eleven ones in the last SotN-speech. In another scene, the character Brandt (Taye Diggs) gets very worked up and gives an emotional response although his character is supposed to have no feelings. In this sense, the movie fails on its very concepts, the drone-like existence of such a society that is depicted in this movie is just not worth watching if one does not make some adjustments. Therefore, it all becomes rather unbelievable, because regardless how wooden an actor is, he/she can never rid him/herself of all types of emotion. If one does not view this as a mindless action movie, because it is very possible to do that just as with 'Starship Troopers', 'Equilibrium' might just make you think about the society we live in today, with its media fixation, leader worshiping and mind control. However, one should probably read one of the books previously mentioned to get a more elaborate, comprehensible view instead of watching this compressed, Disneyfied blunt ripoff. The action sequences are really worth watching, it contains less stringfighting than most and the actors actually stay on the ground for most of the time. Another plus is that the cars used in this future run on gas rather than some hydrogen-derivate, electricity or God-forbid nuclear power. A future where Halliburton, Occidental, ChevronTexaco, Shell and the others would loosen its grip of the world is just plain naÃ¯ve. As of this writing, the rating of this movie is 7.7 out of ten. I would rate it about 4.5 myself. The idea in the script is self-contradictory, but it may pass as a decent action movie if one is not too picky.",RBP_Doc7_Equilibrium,RBP,Sci-Fi,Negative,Equilibrium
188,RBP_Doc8_Equilibrium,"Equilibrium follows a government agent (Christian Bale) in a totalitarian future in which all forms of feeling is outlawed and punishable by death (!). The conflict is that this agent gradually finds himself torn between obeying the strict orders to eliminate criminals and free will and feeling. This film is a big disappointment on almost every level and fails all that it attempts to be (a totalitarian story) and convey (a totalitarian tone). It borrowsÂ—no, stealsÂ—its key ideas and literary devices from the most well-known dystopian novels. The use of socially prescribed drugs to keep people sedated is from Brave New World. The use of a kind of 'thought-police' (what Bale is) is from Nineteen-Eighty-Four. Bale's relationship with a woman (Emily Watson) who tempts him to deviate from cold conformity is also from Nineteen-Eighty-Four. The banning and burning of books and art is from Fahrenheit 451. Even totally trivial things like fight-scenes are stolen from The Matrix, as well as all other stylistic things that end up being inappropriate and over-the-top for the story it tells. In short, Equilibrium does not have one ounce of originality to save itself. It is simply a poor mish-mash of great literature. Nothing about this movie works. I Feel like it is trying too hard to evoke an emotional response and fails to do so at every attempt. Second action is a generic version of matrix for which this film tries so hard to be like. Third performances are nothing to write home about, not fault of the actors, just the writing isn't great and they're working with what they got. Also also also ""sense offenders"" a term used often in this movie has not aged well and is just distasteful. The icing on the cake of a terrible film is the cheesy Hollywood approach to everything. When faced with totalitarian danger, Bale simply goes around blazing his guns and acting like he's the baddest mofo on the planet in doing so. That completely discards any bleak and totalitarian tone it was aiming for, because, who would ever worry if we had a hero like Bale to save us at the end of the day? Lame. Not even serious eye-candy in the form of Sean Bean, Christian Bale, Taye Diggs and Dominic Purcell can save this utterly dire film. I know I said it was a disappointment on ""almost"" every level, meaning it must have had some redeeming parts to itÂ—and I am desperately trying to think of some to support my statement. But seriously, I can't think of any. Sean Bean, maybe. Is that enough?  A darned silly premise, and a disappointing film. Too bad, because the cast is excellent. However, the notion of banning ""feelings"" just doesn't make sense. Feelings are hardwired responses to given situations, evolved over millions of years. Eliminate them and you have a race of motiveless zombies. If none of the characters ""feel"" anything at all (fear of punishment, anger at those breaking the law, etc.) how are they motivated to do anything whatever? This is never explained, as far as I can see. SF is all about ""what if?"" but if the ""what if"" is ridiculous, the resulting story will be silly as well. That, sadly, is the case here. Also, the gunfight scenes are laughable. The concept of a ""gun Kata"" that makes someone effectively impervious to gunfire just doesn't wash. A classic example of the Hollywood approach to SF -- make up some implausible scenario, set it in the future and use it as an excuse for yet more car chases, fights, etc. A big thumbs down",RBP_Doc8_Equilibrium,RBP,Sci-Fi,Negative,Equilibrium
189,RBP_Doc9_Equilibrium,"""Equilibrium"" is a mashup of several major dystopian science fiction stories and films from recent history told with all the logic, subtlety, and skill of a 15 year old boy. I think that a lot of the people impressed by this film must have very low standards. I mean, the ideas involved are good ones (because they are all lifted from ""Fahrenheit 451,"" ""1984,"" THX-1138"" and other, better, sources), and the visuals are nice. But the dialog and story, both presented with the most serious portent, is comically idiotic. For instance the main character tells his partner that the work they're doing to eliminate emotion ""makes it all worth it."" The partner first replies incredulously ""It does?"" Then he gives himself his emotion-dulling injection and declares flatly, ""It does."" I mean, take away the dreary music and you have a comedy bit right out of ""Austin Powers."" So amateurish! Nothing is dumber that something really, really dumb that thinks it's smart. Take about your piles of crap. I really wanted to like this movie as the premise sounded great, but I couldn't. From the opening it just feels light-weight. The fight scenes are weak clones of the Matrix and the whole premise of ""sense offense"" is a Cliff Notes version of 1984. Bales conversion to good guy is laughably simplistic and unbelievable. Not amount of sleek, black outfits, gunfire and weak philosophy can make this stinker into a good movie. ""Equilibium"" is a failure on all levels except the CG set design and the good efforts of good actors suffering a ridiculous screenplay. The blame here falls on the writer-director of this abortion. The greatest flaw is that he sets up his dystopian world's rules (in the clumsiest way possibleâ€”just by literally spelling them out in a prologue) and then fails to follow any of that world's precepts through to any logical conclusions. For instance, why would a totalitarian government that depends upon its populace being drugged leave it to each individual to ""self medicate""? Why not just drug the water and/or food? Why does the main character have a standard nuclear family if all emotional ties have been done away with? For that matter why would he have a wife in the first place? Wouldn't the government take control of all that, given that emotions are not a factor? Did they date? If so, why? And even if so, why would they then live together in a nuclear family? And are so many characters allowed to actually show so much emotion (especially the always-intense Bale), if they're all supposed to be doped up and ""leveled off""? Shouldn't they all be rather zombified? On top of that, the character's actions rarely make any sense. They just do what the writer needs them to do to get from plot point a to plot point bâ€”whether it's anything close to what a real person (drugged or no) would do or not. The whole thing is like a bad comic book cranked out by the worst hacks in the business.

190,RBP_Doc10_Equilibrium,"The high ratings this film gets constantly baffle me. Where to start on how bad it is? Well most bad movies are so because they have a bad story and script. Equilibrium delivers both of those effortlessly; a plot so sci-fi clichÃ© that it feels like a sequel to an Orwell novel adaptation and lines that that have as much style and originality as a the label on a Heinz tomato ketchup bottle. However, on top of that Equilibrium manages to have shoddy directing, pointless scenes which have the only use of trying (but failing) to entice vengeful emotion out of the audience and a set that looks so cheap and tacky that I din't for one second believe I was watching dystopian Libria (how beautifully ironic eh?) but simply that other dystopia - Los Angeles - in a back yard studio behind a brothel...in Los Angeles, to be precise. All I ask of a film is a modicum of plausibility. Are the people credible? Is there some distinct human quality that I can identify as real? Does the plot make any sense? Yes, I know this is science fiction, but even this genre has to meet some minimum standard of plausibility. I'll give you an example of what I mean. Take the TV series, The Prisoner with the late Patrick McGoohan. OK, it wasn't based on the aftermath of World War 4, like Equilibrium. (I'm glad to see mankind pulled through World War III relatively unscathed.) The Prisoner series was based on some hard to identify tyrannical leader who's agents and police tried to control the minds and behavior of residents trapped on a distant island. The TV series was infinitely more interesting, thought-provoking and plausible than Equilibrium. The Patrick Mcgoohan character had more depth, more character than that posed by Christian Bale. Bale is a very solid actor. I've seen him in several films and the guy has genuine talent. But watching him in this move was like watching ice melt over a period of 90 minutes. Then, there were the gun- firing machinations, where the Bale character uses the physics of ballistics and human psychology to anticipate the trajectory of bullets, all in a matter of nanoseconds. Such tactics apparently enabled one man to kill several dozens of highly armed soldiers in brief thunderous cascades of gunfire. As I began, the film is utterly devoid of plausibility - and thus ultimately boring. Pile on ridiculous fight scenes and I am talking the most ridiculous you've ever seen on film, we are talking kung fu...with pistols...that make sword sounds; absolutely blatant film references that, quite frankly, embarrass themselves against the original sci-fi masterpieces (Ridley Scott would swallow his own fist watching this film); the most shoddy CGI of the past ten years; and a soundtrack that sounds like it was made by a fourteen year old kid on his MIDI X100 keyboard that he dug out of the attic - and you have one helluva bad movie. It so desperately wants to be Nineteen Eighty-Four, Blade Runner and (most notably) The Matrix but misses the point completely - they all had substance. Equilibrium has as much substance as its emotionless characters.",RBP_Doc10_Equilibrium,RBP,Sci-Fi,Negative,Equilibrium

I certainly donï¿½t flippantly dismiss any of these gripes but I donï¿½t necessarily agree with them either. Thereï¿½s a lot going on in ï¿½Oblivionï¿½ and while it does borrow from several other sci-fi pictures, the same could be said for most science fiction. As for the lack of character development, that may be true but I found there to be a good and needed reason for it.ï¿½ Like I said the less you know the better so Iï¿½m not going to spoil anything by divulging any significant details. The film is set in 2077 during the aftermath of a war with an alien species known as the Scavengers. The Scavs (as theyï¿½re affectionally called) destroyed our moon which sent Earth into a series of natural and environmental convulsions. A full invasion of Earth followed. The humans won the war but the planet was left ravaged and in disrepair. The surviving population now inhabit one of Saturnï¿½s moons called Titan. Now if a sci-fi movie wants to score points with me just give me a futuristic world thatï¿½s not only visually impressive but that I can get lost in. That certainly happened here and even if you do have issues with the story, no one can say this isnï¿½t an expressive setting.ï¿½ Cruise plays Jack Harper one of the last people left on the planet. He works as a technician who does security and repair work as humanity tries to salvage the last bit of resources from the planet. His lone co-worker is Victoria (Andrea Riseborough). She oversees Jackï¿½s work and reports back to their commanding officer Sally (Melissa Leo). Jack and Victoria have only two weeks left before they get to join the others on Titan, something sheï¿½s very excited about. Naturally things canï¿½t go without a hitch. A series of events triggered by the appearance of a mysterious woman named Julia (Olga Kurylenko) catapult the story into some fun and rather exciting directions.ï¿½ I can honestly say I completely bought into this premise. For the most part itï¿½s a well conceived storyline that undeniably takes from several other familiar sci-fi films. But it works for me mainly because of how intelligently it took all of these components and put them together to form what I think is a very competent and compelling science fiction piece. The story itself grabbed me and pulled me into this visual spectacle and I never found myself wanting to check out.ï¿½ The movie also managed to surprise me. I knew there were twists involved and I had my eyes open for that. For the most part it kept me off balance and had me looking in every direction trying to guess where things were going. While I did eventually figure some things out before they were revealed on screen, it didnï¿½t hurt my experience whatsoever. I also appreciate how this wasnï¿½t a movie of wall-to-wall action. Donï¿½t misunderstand me, there is action, some of it spectacular. But to my surprise the movie spent more time deliberately peeling off layers to the story. Now it may move too glacially for some but I really responded to this approach.ï¿½ With all that praise being said, I did think the film flirted with convention a bit too much in the final act. Itï¿½s not that itï¿½s terrible and poorly done but for me it didnï¿½t really fit with the way the movie had progressed up to that point. Iï¿½m being pretty vague but letï¿½s just say things are a little too on the nose. And while I do think the three main characters arenï¿½t fully developed for good reasons, there are some characters and a particularly important plot point that felt terribly underwritten. This effected a rather important turn that the film takes later on. Iï¿½ll also add that there was one big special effects money shot at the end that I felt was a pretty humdrum. Considering the dazzling effects we had been given up till then, I was expecting a bigger payoff. Iï¿½ll leave it at that.ï¿½ Those are my only gripes and even though they do restrain ï¿½Oblivionï¿½ from being one of the great science fiction pictures, they didnï¿½t kill my experience. In fact I like the film a great deal. Cruise gives another strong lead performance and heï¿½s helped by solid work from Kurylenko and Riseborough. The eye-popping visuals help create a futuristic wonder and the Iceland locations give a perfect sense of desolation. And I havenï¿½t even mentioned the marvelous sound design and the soundtrack from M83 which I found to be a really nice fit. Thereï¿½s just so much I liked about ï¿½Oblivionï¿½. And while I canï¿½t just completely overlook its handful of flaws, theyï¿½re easy to get past especially when you were as intrigued and glued to the screen as I was.""",SDF_Doc2_Oblivion,SDF,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion
193,SDF_Doc3_Oblivion,"""If nothing else, """"Oblivion"""" will go down in film history as the movie where Tom Cruise pilots a white, sperm-shaped craft into a giant space uterus. The scene is more interesting to describe than it is to watch. Cruise's sperm-ship enters through an airlock that resembles a geometrized vulva. He arrives inside a massive chamber lined with egg-like glass bubbles. At the center of the chamber is a pulsating, sentient triangle that is also supposed to be some kind of mother figure. Cruise must destroy the mother triangle and her space uterus in order to save the Earth.ï¿½ Like director Joseph Kosinski's debut, """"Tron: Legacy"""" (2010), """"Oblivion"""" is a special effects extravaganza with a lot of blatant symbolism and very little meaning. It starts slow, turns dull and then becomes tedious ï¿½ which makes it a marginal improvement over the earlier film. It features shiny surfaces, clicky machinery and no recognizable human behavior. It's equally ambitious and gormless.ï¿½ """"Oblivion"""" is set in the year 2077, 60 years after an alien invasion rendered the Earth largely uninhabitable. Cruise stars as Jack Harper, one of a handful of people left on the planet. The other survivors have long since relocated to Titan. Harper and colleagues remain as technicians, servicing robot drones that defend resource-gathering stations from alien stragglers.ï¿½ Harper lives in a penthouse-like tower with his communications officer, Vica (Andrea Riseborough). Vica's eyes are permanently dilated. Like Olivia Wilde's Quorra in """"Tron: Legacy,"""" she often resembles a marionette.ï¿½ Harper and Vica spend their days fixing drones, eating candelit dinners, and swimming in a glass-bottomed pool. Their boss, the creepily cheerful Sally (Melissa Leo), supervises them from an orbiting control center. In order to maintain the integrity of the mission, Harper and Vica's memories have been wiped; nonetheless, Harper is haunted by extremely cheesy black-and-white dreams of a beautiful woman meeting him in pre-invasion New York.ï¿½ One day, Harper spots an antique spacecraft crashing into the countryside. He manages to rescue one survivor, a Russian astronaut (Olga Kurylenko) who looks exactly like the woman in his dreams. Harper brings her back to his tower. This incites jealousy and suspicion from Vica, who is both Harper's partner and his lover.ï¿½ The astronaut has been in cryogenic sleep for the past six decades but refuses to disclose the nature of her mission to Harper and Vica until they recover her flight recorder. It goes without saying that the flight recorder unearths all kinds of secrets about Harper, Vica, and the alien invasion. It also creates one of the movie's more glaring logical errors, but that's a different story altogether.ï¿½ The film's opening stretch is its one strong point ï¿½ï¿½ a gradual, immersive build-up of details. It's a smart technique for science-fiction storytelling; it eases the viewer into the world of the film. The problem is that the world """"Oblivion"""" introduces ï¿½ an abandoned, depopulated Earth ï¿½ is more interesting than the story it tells. Or, more accurately, the stories it tells, because """"Oblivion,"""" derivative to a fault, tries to be several science-fiction movies at once. It tries and it fails.ï¿½ """"Oblivion"""" is a political allegory about a lowly """"technician"""" sending unmanned drones to hunt and kill a demonized, alien Other ï¿½ until it forgets that it ever was. It's a wannabe mindbender that raises questions about its lead character's identity ï¿½ except that the lead character is too sketchy to make these questions compelling. It's a story about humans struggling for survival in an environment controlled by technology ï¿½ except it appears to be much more interested in the technology than in the humans. It's a rah-rah action flick ï¿½ except its action scenes aren't very good.ï¿½ The only thread """"Oblivion"""" follows to the end is its """"creation myth."""" Harper is an idealized man; he's good with a gun, good with his hands, good in bed, loves football and rides a motorcycle. Though most of the movie's characters are women, not one of them is able to do anything without Harper's help ï¿½ not even the mother triangle that lives in the space uterus. Only his rugged-but-sensitive masculinity holds the key to humanity's survival. The movie reaches for profundity, but all it grasps is misogyny.""",SDF_Doc3_Oblivion,SDF,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion
194,SDF_Doc4_Oblivion,"""Filled with amazing post-apocalyptic spectacle, dazzling action sequences, and a heady story of twists and turns, the challenge of Oblivion is whether or not you, as the audience, can allow the strong visuals to make up for the weak narrative.ï¿½ This film will not go down as a 1982-level classic and borrows too many elements from other movies including The Matrix, Planet of the Apes, WALL-E, Tarkovsky and Soderbergh's takes on Solaris, Duncan Jones's under-seen Moon, and even a little Dark City, but Oblivion still has an unmistakable and impressive draw to it.ï¿½ Like all good science fiction, this film stays serious, asks big questions, and takes us to forgivably implausible places.ï¿½ That third element might sound like a knock, but that implausible creativity is what sets science fiction apart from other genres.ï¿½ Science fiction is where the unbelievable comes to life.ï¿½ That's this genre's """"grain of salt."""" For those who think they know all the twists of this film thanks to the supposedly-telling trailers (one, two, and three), you will be pleasantly surprised at the developments.ï¿½ There are some decent curveballs ahead in the journey, some mildly predictable and others very unanticipated.ï¿½ Still, a little too much is already out there, so the following will be spoiler-free.ï¿½ Based on Kosinski's own graphic novel pitch with screenplay polish from William Monahan (The Departed), newcomer Karl Gajdusek, and Michael Arndt (Little Miss Sunshine, Toy Story 3), our setting for Oblivion is Earth in the year 2077.ï¿½ A thwarted alien invasion sixty years earlier in 2017 has decimated the planet and destroyed the moon.ï¿½ The nuclear fallout of the conflict did its fair share of the damage to make the planet uninhabitable, but the loss of the moon's gravity threw the planet's equilibrium into chaos leading to massive earthquakes and tsunamis that destroyed the rest.ï¿½ While the people of Earth won the war, they have been evacuated to Saturn's moon Titan, leaving one immense orbiting space station, the Tet, to regulate the farming of energy to support Titan.ï¿½ Cruise plays Jack Harper, aka Tech 49, an adventurous technician who's been stationed on the planet with his by-the-book communications officer and significant other Victoria (Andrea Riseborough of W.E.).ï¿½ Monitored from the Tet by their commander Sally (Academy Award winner Melissa Leo), they are commissioned with drone repair and maintenance to protect the automated defense system tasked to stamp out the remaining alien resistance known as """"Scavs,"""" and protect the Titan energy extraction. After several years on the job and a mandatory memory wipe, Jack and Victoria are only two weeks away from their end date to join the rest of Earth's survivors on Titan.ï¿½ While Victoria is anxious to leave, Jack's time working on the surface has endeared him to the empty humanity and civilization that remains.ï¿½ He has set aside his own little WALL-E lake house hideaway filled with mementos off the grid away from the decimation and also Victoria's knowledge.ï¿½ Adding to that nostalgia, Jack cannot shake recurring dreams and visions he has of himself living in New York before the war and with a mystery woman (Olga Kurylenko) that he can't remember.ï¿½ When Jack rescues that very woman, astronaut Julia Rusakova, who arrives from a crashing 60-year-old space shuttle in cryo-sleep, from the violent drones he repairs, his emotions and duty become conflicted.ï¿½ Soon after, he is apprehended by an armed human resistance on the surface, led by Morgan Freeman's Malcolm Beach and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's second-in-command, that may or may not have the answers to Jack's conflict and the nature of the true enemy at work.ï¿½ As aforementioned, Oblivion, from a plot and plot twist standpoint, stands on the shoulders of other science-fiction films of recent memory and takes its dear sweet time to show its cards and play its hand.ï¿½ Clearly with four dominating heads at work (Kosinski, Monahan, Gajdusek, and Arndt), there were """"too many cooks in the kitchen.""""ï¿½ When you step back, its story is very thin and wet-pasta-flimsy, but the execution is what saves the picture.ï¿½ While most science fiction movies can't carry a decent love story at its core, Oblivion succeeds with a rather touching Solaris-like connection between Jack and Julia that grows nicely.ï¿½ Cruise is an absolutely solid lead, both in action and in drama situations.ï¿½ As always, and its petty to still have to mention, please separate the man of Tom Cruise from the performer.ï¿½ He's still one of the best actors working today.ï¿½ Kurylenko just has to look good (originally that was supposed to be Jessica Chastain, but Zero Dark Thirty filled her schedule, picture that), but it's Riseborough that weaves a few tangled web strands of her own seduction and devotion that contrast well to rest of the love triangle.ï¿½ Oblivion is an example where the visuals and aesthetics save a weak story.ï¿½ Recent Oscar-winning cinematographer Claudio Miranda (Life of Pi) photographs """"apocalypse porn"""" from the desolate, yet striking Icelandic landscapes and vistas that are doubling as a washed-out Eastern United States.ï¿½ Not a shot is muddled or out of place, between the raw nature and the impressive futuristic production design.ï¿½ The movie breathes with those lonely visuals and pulses with a sublime electronic/orchestration mash-up score from French band M83.ï¿½ It's Vangelis-Blade Runner epic in tone.ï¿½ Like Kosinski's outstanding and inventive use of an orchestra-backed Daft Punk score from Tron: Legacy, the future of movie soundtracks takes another bold step forward.ï¿½ Altogether, Oblivion is a handsome package that can't be denied.ï¿½ Come to the film for the visuals and hang around for enough surprises and developments to make you feel better about the IMAX ticket price.ï¿½ Once again, it's not a sure-fire classic, but it's just the start to a promising 2013 for science fiction.ï¿½ LESSON #1: WHEN THE EFFECTIVE BECOMES INEFFECTIVE-- The ongoing expectation from Sally's homebase for Jack and Victoria is whether or not they are an effective team.ï¿½ By effective, she means following orders and working together.ï¿½ If Jack puts aside his feelings and just rides out his two remaining weeks on the job, he won't make the waves and take the risks that challenge the team's orders and effectiveness.ï¿½ Like all moral dilemmas against protocol and orders, sometimes the heart wins and takes over.ï¿½ LESSON #2: THE INSTINCTUAL DRAW OF ONE'S HOME-- Victoria is laser-focused on getting away from Earth and joining the others on Titan.ï¿½ She doesn't risk anything towards that goal.ï¿½ She won't embrace the surface or even take a gift of a flower from Jack for fear of contamination and leftover toxins from war.ï¿½ Jack is the complete opposite.ï¿½ Earth is still home and he is drawn to it.ï¿½ He feels the music, the books, the breeze, and the memories.ï¿½ Some of that is good, old-fashioned animal connection to one's habitat and home.ï¿½ LESSON #3: THE DREAMS AND VISIONS THAT STICK WITH US TO THE CORE-- No prescribed memory wipe from the bosses can shake Jack's pre-war visions of New York and a fixation on a woman that he doesn't remember, but deeply loves.ï¿½ Whether the dreams and visions we have mean anything or not (enjoy the dream theory books and blogs), we all can relate to having such unforgettable flashes that we can't shake.ï¿½ We all have unforgettable dreams and imagery, some good, some bad, some real, some fantasy, that stick with us for life.""",SDF_Doc4_Oblivion,SDF,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion
195,SDF_Doc5_Oblivion,"""If only it were less easy to laugh at ï¿½Oblivion,ï¿½ a lackluster science-fiction adventure with Tom Cruise that, even before its opening, was groaning under the weight of its hard-working, slowly fading star and a title that invites mockery of him and it both. The agony of being a longtime Tom Cruise fan has always been a burden, but now itï¿½s just, well, dispiriting. You not only have to ignore the din of the tabloids and swat away the buzzing generated by his multiple headline-ready dramas, you also have to come to grips with the harsh truth that it no longer actually matters why and how Tom Terrific became less so. No one else much cares.ï¿½ Mr. Cruise hasnï¿½t made it easy. His screen presence has continued to grow ever-more self-serious, despite occasional attempts to lighten up, as in the recent would-be satire ï¿½Rock of Ages.ï¿½ Midway through ï¿½Oblivionï¿½ I wondered when I had last believed there was something true in his laugh, something that felt either genuinely expansive or intimate, as in ï¿½Jerry Maguire,ï¿½ or chilled with a hint of madness, as in ï¿½Magnolia.ï¿½ Mind you, he doesnï¿½t have many occasions to laugh in ï¿½Oblivion,ï¿½ a gray post-apocalyptic tale with rainbow accents, yet when he does, it feels uncomfortably forced. In those moments, was he worrying that the movie wasnï¿½t going to return him to the box office summit? Heï¿½s 50 years old and too young to be prepping for a slow fade, yet what are his choices?ï¿½ Working with better directors ï¿½ with filmmakers who know how to charm or force performances out of stars or perhaps say no to them ï¿½ seems like a good place to start. ï¿½Oblivionï¿½ is only the second feature directed by Joseph Kosinski, after the 2010 release ï¿½Tron: Legacy.ï¿½ That special effects-laden fantasy, a musty heroï¿½s journey largely distinguished by the yawning divide between its poor quality and its $170 million price tag, was a flat line of a dud in almost every respect. It nonetheless made enough money to shore up an exploitable franchise property and spawn a sequel, and while this may not sound like much of an achievement, box office success or the perception of it can beget more opportunities in the movie business, which may help explain ï¿½Oblivion.ï¿½ Its story primarily unfolds in 2077, long after a cataclysmic war between earthlings and extraterrestrials. Nuked to all but radioactive ash, the Earth has been rendered nearly uninhabitable, and its remaining people have fled to a galactic shelter. The only ones left on the planet appear to be Jack Harper (Mr. Cruise) and his companion, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), who live in a cantilevered aerie above the clouds that brings to mind a ï¿½Jetsonsï¿½ sky pad. His job is to repair drones that patrol the facilities that extract resources for the surviving populace and that are under attack from the aliens, or Scavs, as in scavengers. She monitors him back at their place, waving her hands over a tabletop computer, while in full makeup and rocking some fabulous end-of-days-to-night dresses and heels.ï¿½ The heels seem a strange choice given, you know, the whole doomsday thing, not to mention the glossiness of the coupleï¿½s floors. Then again, from the way she strips for some late-night nuzzling, her get-up does appear to have instrumental value, even if one misstep and she or at least an ankle would be a goner. A similar kind of tricky balancing act is inherent in science fiction, a genre that often employs recognizable details to tether readers and viewers in fantastical realms. Itï¿½s a form, as is often noted, that makes the strange familiar and the familiar strange, a narrative principle that Mr. Kosinski embraces again and again with niceties like Jackï¿½s Yankee baseball cap and Jack and Victoriaï¿½s candlelight dinners.ï¿½ The candles add atmosphere, as does that baseball cap. But because Mr. Kosinski hasnï¿½t come up with a resonant idea to accompany them ï¿½ a new or different way of looking at the world that exists and the world that might one day come into being ï¿½ his retro flourishes prove as empty as the lunarlike landscapes. Thereï¿½s an arresting moment, for instance, when Jack drives through a blasted-out terrain littered with ships partly submerged in earth, a vista that demonstrates Mr. Kosinskiï¿½s fondness for playing with negative space. The vision of a man existentially alone conjures up countless cowboys traveling through innumerable westerns and summons up the shock of the half-buried Statue of Liberty in ï¿½Planet of the Apes.ï¿½ Yet again, Mr. Kosinski fails to build on his materials and the allusions soon fade.ï¿½ All genre fictions build, self-consciously or not, on their progenitors. The problem with ï¿½Oblivion,ï¿½ which is based on an unpublished graphic novel Mr. Kosinski wrote and used to pitch the studio, is that itï¿½s been stitched together from bits and pieces that evoke numerous other, far better far-out tales and ideas, conceits and characters from the likes of Philip K. Dick, the Wachowskis, J. G. Ballard and Duncan Jones, specifically his elegant, elegiac movie, ï¿½Moon.ï¿½ No matter how hard Mr. Cruise squares his jaw or flings his body over and against the scenery, and despite the presence of Morgan Freeman, Olga Kurylenko and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who trickle into the story to aid in Jackï¿½s journey, ï¿½Oblivionï¿½ never transcends its inspirations to become anything other than a thin copy.""",SDF_Doc5_Oblivion,SDF,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion
196,SDF_Doc6_Oblivion,"""Oblivionï¿½ is a competently made sci-fi action movie ï¿½ something that canï¿½t be said about the majority of the genre. Though many of the prominent futurism themes can be linked back to earlier films, and a few loose ends might not be tied up with the sturdiest of knots, the structure and plot twists keep the intrigue high while the action paces itself nicely alongside the unfolding mystery. Tom Cruise makes a compelling hero and the setup is a savvy blend of dystopian invention and amnesia-induced identity loss. The list of films ï¿½Oblivionï¿½ borrows from is a long one, but the concepts are all executed cleverly and proficiently, resulting in an epic space opus that presents far more moments of awe than head-scratching queries.ï¿½ The year is 2077 and Earth has been left nearly uninhabitable after a brutal war against an invading alien species known as ï¿½Scavengers.ï¿½ While the remnants of humanity have been gathered aboard the Tet, an enormous pyramidal space station that will eventually carry the survivors to a new home on one of Saturnï¿½s moons, technician Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and his partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) remain on Earth to monitor and perform maintenance on giant hydro-rigs and the protective, heavily armed robot drones that guard them. When a spaceship crash-lands nearby and Jack investigates, he rescues from the wreckage Julia (Olga Kurylenko), a mysterious woman whose appearance sets into motion the discovery of a massive conspiracy that will place the very fate of mankind in Jackï¿½s hands.ï¿½ ï¿½Oblivionï¿½ is heady, weighty, and cerebral science-fiction, foregoing the little green man angle for a much more sinister and complex alien incursion. In terms of postapocalyptic, futuristic thrillers, borrowing randomly from ï¿½The Road Warrior,ï¿½ ï¿½2001: A Space Odyssey,ï¿½ ï¿½Moon,ï¿½ ï¿½The Matrix,ï¿½ and ï¿½Total Recall,ï¿½ itï¿½s a highly ambitious and largely successful twist, toying with existential and deterministic viewpoints while smartly avoiding depressing bouts of violence or sacrifice. Its focus on altering or interfering with memories is augmented perfectly by the heavily synthesized soundtrack, itself lending to the dreamlike qualities of Jackï¿½s remembrances. An engaging mystery, ï¿½Oblivionï¿½ forces viewers to wait nearly two hours before giving up any secrets; but to the filmï¿½s credit, the protracted anticipation is delightful. Mind-boggling and artistically visionary, the many answers it finally grapples with will probably raise further investigations into the various aspects less examined, but the climactic conclusion is pleasantly resolute ï¿½ even if specific details can be rationalized with the term ï¿½gaping plot holes.ï¿½ An exemplary fit for IMAX screens, ï¿½Oblivionï¿½ boasts outstanding visuals that add tremendously to the scope of the project. Immense exterior shots and sets introduce the audience to a uniquely fascinating world, with unfriendly terrain, monumental wreckage, and obscured paradises. The interior designs are just as spectacular, though used much more sparingly. The obvious budget for special effects definitely helps establish and stabilize the pioneering perspective; visual wizardry occasionally substitutes for inchoate plot points. But perhaps most impressive of all is the origins of the story, starting as a graphic novel by Joseph Kosinski, who not only adapted it into a screenplay, but also produced and directed the movie. Not bad for a filmmaker whose only other directing credit is ï¿½TRON: Legacy.ï¿½""",SDF_Doc6_Oblivion,SDF,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion
197,SDF_Doc7_Oblivion,"""This movie reminds me of how much I like non-3D movies when they achieve the visual brilliance that this distopian sci-fi thriller does. As with many films that give us a bleak view of our future, the thing around which the drama revolves is the concept.ï¿½ The year is 2077. In 2017, aliens with advanced technology attacked earth, destroyed the moon and left the planet a decimated mess before they were vanquished. But, though humans apparently won the battle, remaining alien """"Scavs,"""" or Scavengers -- dark, freaky critters -- prowl for humans they can destroy, making up a cadre of resistance fighters.ï¿½ To combat this mortal threat, humans are controlling things from their huge tetrahedral space station they call the """"Tet."""" One of their armaments designed for this purpose is a small fleet of armed, robotic drones (wherever did they get that idea?) which are programmed to seek and destroy Scavs. That is, when they're working. When they go down, for one reason or another, the humans up in the Tet have their male/female, memory-wiped team in the work tower on earth to deal with the problem.ï¿½ But The two consists of Jack Harper, aka, Technician #49 (Tom Cruise), who goes from the lush modernist pad in which they've taken residence, down to the surface of earth to fix the drones; and, secondly, communications officer Victoria (Andrea Riseborough, """"Happy-Go-Lucky"""") who reports to and stays in contact via video link with their Tet commander Sally (Melissa Leo, """"The Fighter""""), a woman with all the heart of a sociopath. That's harsh. Let's just say """"she's doing her job."""" After all, doesn't she always end her sessions with Victoria by asking if she, Victoria, and Tech49 are an effective team? Such concern. But, this is Teteze for, """"are you following the rules?"""" The primary part of Tech49 and Victoria's mission, however, is to protect the planet's resources and the extraction machines that feed the needs of the Titan colony. Titan is represented as an ideal place to go to -- an Eden awaiting humans when their mission is complete. For Victoria and Jack that's in two weeks time.ï¿½ The movie begins with Tech49 arising from bed and donning his smart spacesuit and weapons, a holstered handgun and a mean-looking heavy rifle. Ammo is of the laser variety -- no clips necessary. In the bed also is the super-efficient Victoria who contacts Sally for the day's mission: two drones in need of repair.ï¿½ The big BUT, here, is that Jack is seeing images, in dreams night and day, that he correctly identifies as memory shards from his former life. The so-called """"security wipe"""" of his memory that he and Victoria had to go through to get this cushy job was less than perfect, and he's a man caught between two realities. There's a woman he sees in his visions whom he thinks had an important role in his life before the alien invasion. When he starts talking to Victoria about leaving their job for his secret earth hideaway, she doesn't understand. Her lover is going bats and she worries about not being """"an effective team."""" But, the complications are only beginning. New York's Empire State Building still stands. When the Scavs use it as a homing beacon to bring down the Odyssey, a spaceship that might have been Jack's ride home, he discovers humans in hibernation capsules, all but one killed by a Scav party before Jack could kill them. The survivor is the woman he's been seeing in his visions. Julia (Olga Kurylenko, """"Quantum of Solace""""): his """"real-life"""" wife. Naturally.ï¿½ Around this time, Jack makes another discovery, with a character played by the esteemed Morgan Freeman.ï¿½ You can see where this is going as far as the human factor. Victoria's not going to like this when her Jack brings a gorgeous female to the work station. Besides the jealousy that now inflames her, she's got to dodge Sally's questions to avoid giving away the abnormal developments.ï¿½ But Sally can read her officer on the other end of the comm feed like a wizard with a deck of cards and what's been set in motion is pointing toward unexpected consequences for everyone. In fact, thinking about wizards, the revelations are lining up as too-liberal twists on the real and the unreal.ï¿½ What passes for logic is, shall we say, strained, which accounts for a mediocre critical reception for the last act surprises that don't stand up to mild scrutiny. I have to admit, the narrative liberties don't pass the story integrity barrier. But Kosinski gets away with it. There's too much earnest effectiveness and suspense in his vision to write it off. Besides, I'm a sucker for concepts of advanced technology.ï¿½ Of course, this is first and foremost designed to provide a platform for Cruise's physical skills. Which is not at all bad for us action fans. What Cruise does with his talents has given us some considerable thrills (""""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"""" Remember that sequence at the top of the Burj Khalifa tower in Dubai?). I wanted to see this film badly because it was a Tom Cruise vehicle and, though the physical requirements weren't as extreme as some of his work, I was not disappointed. He may not be the kind of actor to win Oscars, but his strengths, including taste for material that allows him to make the most of them, compensate for deficiencies.ï¿½ Nor was I disappointed by the rest of the cast, most notably Riseborough who played the perfect not-quite-a-person person. Kurylenko is pure screen candy. And Leo is acutely acidic as befits a Tet officer.ï¿½ All of which goes to the credit of Joseph Kosinski (""""TRON: Legacy"""") who produced, directed and co-wrote the adaptation from his unpublished graphic novel which was edited by Radical Comics. The representation of this evacuated world is nothing less than spectacular in all visual respects. As said, with visual perfection like this, who needs 3D and its color desaturation?""",SDF_Doc7_Oblivion,SDF,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion
198,SDF_Doc8_Oblivion,"""In many movies, the plot becomes less and less interesting the more it unfurls. The mystery is the thing, and when that disappears, the appeal goes with it. There needs to be more than mystery for a movie to hold up until the end.ï¿½ To be fair, the best moments of """"Oblivion,"""" from co-writer/director Joseph Kosinski (""""Tron: Legacy""""), based on his own, unpublished graphic novel, occur in its first half, as it introduces its future world -- the Earth of 2077, more than a half-century after a war with aliens known as Scavengers, or Scavs, left it uninhabitable, forcing its inhabitants to flee to Titan, Saturn's largest moon.ï¿½ A lone couple (Tom Cruise, Andrea Riseborough) lives in a sleek tower high above the ruins of New York City, finishing a five-year mission maintaining the machines harvesting the planet's water for conversion into energy. Two weeks and they're off to join the others on Titan. (If you think that seems like a tall order for two people, stay with it; it'll make sense.) Victoria (Riseborough) is content to do her job, asking no questions and dutifully reporting to her commander, Sally (Melissa Leo). Everything seems to be going according to plan, but something appears to be -- off. Sally is just a bit too pleasant, Victoria and Jack's (Cruise) relationship a little too idyllic.ï¿½ Jack is haunted by dreams of a woman -- dreams that feel more like memories, only he and Victoria supposedly had their memories wiped before starting their assignment. He explores the planet when he can, collecting books and other items he comes across -- he's even built himself a nice little cabin with a basketball hoop.ï¿½ When a ship crashes to the surface, Jack is astonished to find the only survivor is Julia (Olga Kurylenko), literally the woman of his dreams. His already questioning mind needs answers, especially after he finds there are others, led by Malcolm Beech (Morgan Freeman), still living on the planet.ï¿½ After Kosinski, who shares the screenplay credit with two others, takes his time building and exploring his world, several revelations roll out in succession, the movie changing with each one but never becoming less than compelling. I will leave the big surprises for you to discover and enjoy on your own.ï¿½ Visually, the movie is a marvel, the ravaged Earth in stark contrast to Jack and Victoria's high-tech living quarters dominated by whites and stainless steel. And it's brought to life by Claudio Miranda's (an Oscar winner for """"Life of Pi"""") striking cinematography.ï¿½ Though it ultimately comes down to flying bullets and blowing things up, Kosinski, like the creators of all the best science fiction, has a little more on his mind, namely the concept of identity and how it is created and defined, and he uses Cruise's tendency to be a bit of a blank slate to his advantage as he plays with this idea.ï¿½ While not nearly as ponderous as, say """"2001: A Space Odyssey,"""" """"Oblivion"""" is not the slam-bang action picture some might expect. Digital effects abound, but they are in service to the story, to an idea, instead of being the point. Good, smart sci-fi like this is increasingly rare.""",SDF_Doc8_Oblivion,SDF,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion
199,SDF_Doc9_Oblivion,"""In 2009, Joseph Kosinski was given a peach of a first-time directing gig, making a sequel to Tron with an enormous budget and effects department beyond the originalï¿½s most lurid electric dreams. Tron Legacy showed three things: 1) Kosinski was masterful at creating an entirely imagined world right down to the tiniest detail; 2) He liked big, Messianic plots and taking time to explore them; and 3) He was a lot better with scenery than people. With Oblivion, based on a comic book he wrote in 2005 but never published, Kosinski reasserts those first two points and only moderately improves on the third.ï¿½ Oblivion has a crowded imagination and an empty heart. It blasts you with information in the opening few minutes. Before you've had time to finish chewing your first mouthful of popcorn we have learned that Earth was attacked by aliens in the late 21st century and its moon smashed to space rubble, causing earthquakes and floods that obliterated the population. Nuclear war followed, leaving the place a horrible mess, so most of humanity has left for a new home called Titan, and all that remains on Earth are the invaders, scattered in underground tribes, some huge water-processing thingums that are converting energy from the seas for Titan in some way, and Jack and Victoria, a couple played by Tom Cruise and Andrea Riseborough. Day in, day out, they guard the equipment, all alone on Earth in a condo in the clouds, full of hard, shiny surfaces that suggest that in the decades ahead, comfort will become deeply unfashionable. Their only contact besides each other is with their prickly contact (Melissa Leo) on a giant monolith that acts as a relay between humanityï¿½s old and new homes.ï¿½ After this initial onslaught of information, the brakes are pulled on and Kosinski takes his time exploring his world, which, given the wonderful art direction, is a curiously calming, absorbing fantasy travelogue. Jack pootles about fixing drones ï¿½ spherical security guards that look like HALï¿½s robo-dog and make a noise like a grumpy Speak & Spell ï¿½ and taking quiet time in a lodge by a lake. It feels real, partly due to being shot on actual locations, primarily in Iceland, rather than via green-screen. Thereï¿½s a bit of Mad Max to this stretch of a man just surviving in a thankless world, and these scenes, in which very little actually happens, are actually more enticing than the time after the film decides to pile on the plot. Jack finds a mysterious woman (Olga Kurylenko), whom he knows from his dreams, and some hidden humans (led by Morgan Freeman), and it becomes a puzzle of who knows what, who doesnï¿½t actually know what they think they know, and what the things are that may or may not in fact know the things they think they know. For all its convolution, Kosinski actually lays his plot out rather smoothly. Its twists all have twists, but not to the point that theyï¿½re difficult to follow, and the ending is at once complex and neat, like the centre of a spiderï¿½s web. It is a fine story. Yet itï¿½s so hard to invest in it, because the characters are so flimsy.ï¿½ As with Tron Legacy, there is the sense that Kosinski considers his characters merely tools for getting him to a big reveal. He doesnï¿½t seem interested in exploring the people, but using them to explore a grand idea. Thatï¿½s not always a bad thing. There are plenty of sci-fi movies that hinge on you caring what odd thing is going to happen rather than about the people itï¿½s happening to, an obvious example being 2001: A Space Odyssey, which is referenced several times here. But thatï¿½s not really the sort of film this is. Its big moments centre on relationships and love, and the primary themes are humanity and identity, yet the characters arenï¿½t burdened with either. Cruise is an actor so famous that he will always be fighting to disappear behind a role, but Jack is, more than most, just a ï¿½Tom Cruise roleï¿½. He doesnï¿½t have any personality separate from the man playing him. Riseborough is the only one who really comes off as a complete person, which is all the greater achievement given that hers is the character who is, on paper, the least significant. She gives a sad, trapped performance that lends some humanity to this desolate world.ï¿½ On one level, Oblivion is a strong sci-fi riddle boldly staged, yet thatï¿½s only half its ambition. As a story of a man struggling with his place in the world and with the power of love to conquer all, itï¿½s as dry and crumbly as its nuked landscape.""",SDF_Doc9_Oblivion,SDF,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion
200,SDF_Doc10_Oblivion,"""Without getting too far into an impassioned defence of Kosinskiï¿½s film it does seem as though the accusations that Oblivion is an exercise in style over substance may be slightly wide of the mark.ï¿½ The constraints of a review generally mean that plot points and ideas can only be discussed in general terms for fear of spoiling things, but this article aims to go a little deeper, and explain why, at least in my opinion, Oblivion is far from a handsome yet empty vessel.ï¿½ Are you an effective team?ï¿½ In a lengthy introduction, Tom Cruiseï¿½s Jack Harper outlines the story behind Oblivionï¿½s devastated Earth. A war with invading aliens resulted in the destruction of our Moon and a decimated population; in Harperï¿½s words, ï¿½We won the war, but they destroyed half the planet.ï¿½ With the Earthï¿½s surface an irradiated ruin, Harperï¿½s one of several soldier-repairmen who swoop down from their cloud bases and fix the hovering droids which keep the remaining aliens (called Scavs) at bay. Most of Earthï¿½s surviving population now live on the Tet, a gigantic ship in Earthï¿½s orbit, and Harper, along with his desk-jockey work partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), have a few more weeks before they can join them. Once the final preparations have been made, the Tet will then set off for a new start on one of Saturnï¿½s terraformed moons.ï¿½ Gradually, however, Harper learns that all is not it seems. The unexpected return of his wife Julia (Olga Kurylenko) stirs up suppressed memories of his past, and Harper realises that everything around him is an elaborate construct. The Tet isnï¿½t a last refuge for humanity, but the conquering aliensï¿½ mothership. The Scavs are actually the human survivors of the war, forced underground and held there by the powerful droids which Harper has been maintaining.ï¿½ Harper is himself almost as artificial as those droids; he and Victoria are clones of astronauts captured by the aliens during a space mission decades earlier. The aliens have harnessed thousands of these Harper and Victoria clones to monitor and repair the machines, while gigantic hydro rigs suck the planetï¿½s resources dry out at sea.ï¿½ Armed with this knowledge, Harper finds himself siding with Malcolm Beech (Morgan Freeman), the leader of the human survivors, and using his unique ability to control the droids in order to turn the tables on the alien invaders.ï¿½ I want mankind to survive. This is the only way.ï¿½ There is much in Oblivionï¿½s story and plot twists that is familiar from other sci-fi touchstones. The unexpected return of a loved one and the use of a woodland house recalls Andrei Tarkovskyï¿½s Solaris. That Harperï¿½s a clone is, yes, something we saw in Duncan Jonesï¿½s Moon, which itself follows a genre staple that stretches back to Aldous Huxleyï¿½s Brave New World.ï¿½ Moon was an existential drama about a man coming to terms first with his own loneliness and isolation, and then making peace with his artificial twin. It was poignant, thought-provoking, and had at its centre a career-best performance from Sam Rockwell. The way Oblivion deals with the concept of cloning is very different from Moon, and its use of the genre staple is much closer to a Philip K Dick novel. Oblivionï¿½s plot developments are not unlike the 1956 book, The World Jones Made, or any number of Dickï¿½s novels where the protagonist discovers heï¿½s a pawn trapped in a false reality.ï¿½ In Oblivion, the Harper clones are stuck on an artificial treadmill of work and shallow relations. He and Victoria live together in a luxurious yet sterile condominium-cum-workstation among the clouds, where they have sex but display few signs of genuine affection for one another ï¿½ much like the promiscuous, drugged-up populace of Brave New World in fact.ï¿½ The arrival of Julia reminds Harper of the sort of life heï¿½d secretly been pining for: an ordinary house on earthly soil, a family, a meaningful relationship. Oblivionï¿½s philosophy is laid out in Juliaï¿½s lakeside speech (and one of the scriptï¿½s strongest moments): ï¿½Weï¿½d grow old and fat together. Weï¿½d fight and get drunk. Then weï¿½d die and be buried in a meadow by the lake. But weï¿½d always have each otherï¿½ï¿½ Later events make clear that clones are extinguished if theyï¿½re no longer ï¿½an effective teamï¿½, which means that, until Julia arrives, Harper has been reliving the same superficial grind. Only by breaking the aliensï¿½ chokehold can he experience life in all its fullness: passion, parenthood, kinship, and ultimately death.ï¿½ What are you looking for in those books?ï¿½ Itï¿½s possible thereï¿½s something else buried n Oblivionï¿½s sci-fi fable, too ï¿½ something which, depending on your interpretation, could be seen as quite subversive.ï¿½ Pare away the science fiction surface detail, and whatï¿½s left? A story about a loyal soldier manipulated into fighting an unjust war against primitive people. Expected to follow orders without thinking (ï¿½Donï¿½t ask too many questions. All part of the job descriptionï¿½), Harper keeps the wheels of the war machine turning, unaware that his masters ï¿½ represented by the homely drawl of Melissa Leo ï¿½ are stripping his home planet of its precious resources.ï¿½ Not unlike Jake Sully in Avatar, Harper eventually sides with the insurgents he was unwittingly helping to repress, and together, they use unconventional tactics ï¿½ turning droids into improvised explosive devices, and eventually, a suicide bombing ï¿½ to bring this inhuman war machineï¿½s reign to an end.ï¿½ For a film widely dismissed as superficial and meaningless, these are heavy themes. And viewed like this, the parallels between Oblivionï¿½s events and the recent war on Iraq (at least, as described by its critics) become clear, and are underlined further by the drones themselves, which could be seen as a sci-fi analogue of the contraptions currently roaming the skies in the Middle East and elsewhere.ï¿½ This is purely one personï¿½s interpretation, of course, and for some, Oblivion will remain as empty and ponderous as its most vociferous critics have suggested. But if thereï¿½s one pertinent message that appears to be buried in Oblivion, itï¿½s that the voices of authority arenï¿½t necessarily as benign and trustworthy as they appear, and that individual thought and investigation are vital means of preserving freedom.ï¿½ That, for me, is a more thought-provoking sentiment than Iï¿½d usually expect to find in an expensive multiplex blockbuster.""",SDF_Doc10_Oblivion,SDF,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion
