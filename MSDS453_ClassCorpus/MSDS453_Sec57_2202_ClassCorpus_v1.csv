1,EMU_Doc1_TheConjuring3,EMU,Horror,Negative,The Conjuring 3,"I must admit that when I sat down to watch the 2021 addition to ""The Conjuring"" franchise, I was not harboring much of any overly great expectations or hopes, because since the first movie it has been a steady downward slope. Still, as I had the chance to sit down and watch ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"" from writers David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick and James Wan. So of course I did it. And I have to say that director Michael Chaves managed to deliver a movie that was only slightly entertaining. ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"" was a whole lot of nothing going on, and you can essentially just watch the beginning and the last 25 minutes of the movie and skip on everything in between. The storyline written for ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"" was bland and slow paced, with very little of much excitement or interest happening in between the start and the end of the movie. And that ultimately led to a less than mediocre movie experience for me. And yeah, I am a horror veteran, so ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"" was a walk in park. There were a few jump scare moments to be had here, but they could be seen coming a mile away. And the storyline wasn't particularly dark, brooding or scary. So this was not an impressive foray into the horror genre. I will say that the special effects in ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"" were good, and they definitely added something worthwhile to the movie. And ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"" is not a movie that is a make or break experience with its special effects, but they do add a good element to the overall experience of the movie. The acting in the movie was good, but of course we are talking about actor Patrick Wilson and actress Vera Farmiga here, whom singlehandedly have been carrying the franchise with their performances. And true to the formula, they are the ones making it watchable again with the 2021 ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"". It should also be noted that the casting of Eugenie Bondurant as the occultist was a spot on choice, because she was genuinely creepy with her performance. As I entered this movie with no expectations I can't say that I was disappointed with the end result. But take heed, this is by no means a milestone in the horror cinema. ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"" came and went without leaving a lasting impression for me, just as the numerous other movies in the franchise - as their spin-off movies - have done. I can't tell them apart if you were to ask me what the second movie was about, for instance. My rating of the 2021 ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"" lands on a less than mediocre four out of ten stars. Sure, it was a watchable movie, and if you are new to the horror genre, then you will be in for something good I suppose. But if you expect a bit more from the movies you sit down to watch then ""The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It"" just doesn't cut it."
2,EMU_Doc2_TheConjuring3,EMU,Horror,Positive,The Conjuring 3,"While The Conjuring franchise has stood as one of the most successful and impressive horror series from the past few decades, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It had enough on paper to put the status of the sequel in question. Coming as the third film in the main series, the film ditched the legendary James Wan as director with Michael Chaves instead stepping up to the role after his work on 2019's The Curse of La Llorona which is universally known as one of the worst editions in the cinematic universe. With a shaky main trailer and this change in crew, it was natural to feel iffy walking into the film only for it to surprise greatly with a unique yet captivating story that built on the strengths of the franchise to confidently find a fresh and new direction. Throughout nearly every film within this cinematic universe, one of the brightest spots of the universe has been the cinematic portrayals of The Warrens played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. With an undeniable chemistry and charm, these two have been the blood and soul of the franchise with The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It putting this relationship front and center within the film's drama and focus. As the couple investigates a mysterious case of possession, they find themselves hunted and targeted with the stakes being more personal than ever. The drive from each actor and character to protect the other and make it out of the situation alive is more than enough to hook the audience and give the film a unique sense of humanity and drama.  Where there are still demons and possession around nearly every corner, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It has a unique threat that is far more grounded in the human world which gives an incredibly unique dynamic to the tension and horror within the film. In this sense, the film has to be considered a massive success for Michael Chaves who clearly put a unique touch on the feature that at times feels bold and confident. Chaves isn't simply trying to recreate the magic James Wan brought to the earlier editions of the series but rather is trying to evolve the material and film to stand on its own. Where this switch in focus does provide some of the strongest moments of the film, it also can cause a sense of disruption within the soul of the movie. The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It often sides more with the identity of a mystery crime thriller than a jumpscare horror film with the movie never fully willing to completely reinvent itself. Where there are some more horrifying sequences towards the end that naturally build and fit into the film's narrative, the majority of the jumpscare sequences to come before the closing feel really out of place and forced. Clearly the film was worried about losing the core audience that has come to love the terrifying horror up to this point and included these scenes to cheaply attempt to please these fans despite not really making sense in the context of the film. These scenes stand out not just due to the more messy attempts to write them into the narrative but also due to the lesser quality of horror in which they feature. Unlike the wind-up box of the first film or any of the gimmicks within the second, the aesthetic and gimmicks within this feature are instantly forgettable and overall feel lackluster. Where the other Conjuring films from the main series has truly struck a sense of terror within audiences, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It fails to come close to achieving this but considering its focus is in a different place, that isn't nearly as damming as a statement as it might seem. Where The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It might not be the most horrifying edition in the Conjuring franchise and universe, it still is a rather successful film taking a more personable and grounded approach that will suck audiences in for a fun yet thrilling adventure held together by likable characters and an overarching theme of love. Where some diehard fans of the franchise might reject this new direction, for plenty it will prove effective and it seems like even with Wan stepping away from the franchise he has worked to build the franchise has the potential to continue to give worthwhile sequels and battles with the paranormal."
3,EMU_Doc3_TheConjuring3,EMU,Horror,Positive,The Conjuring 3,"We’re well into the world and the lore of the Warrens. Ed and Lorraine, the fictional versions of the real-life paranormal investigators, have held our hands through some of the most terrifying haunts and spared would-be victims of demons using their skills and love. The third in the prime canon, (and the eighth in The Conjuring Universe) is here with some more of the same, and that’s exactly what I wanted. The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It tackles the grim case of Arne Johnson. The Warren’s (Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson) visit a farmhouse to assist in exorcising a demon from a young boy named David (Julian Hillard). When they’re seemingly bested by the beast, David’s boarding brother, Arne (Ruairi O’Connor), offers himself to the demon as a vessel. With no one noticing how the ordeal concludes, they return to normal life expecting the sunshine and birds chirping ending has arrived. But Arne, now in the arms of a demonic presence, kills the landlord and swears the devil made him do it. With the support of the Warren’s and his girlfriend, Debbie (Sarah Catherine Hook), Arne intends to present his criminal defence as such. The Warrens set off on a path of discovering the nature of this curse and, in doing so, get incredibly close to the spirit in a way that puts them in the line of hellfire. Convincing skeptics and law enforcement on the way, they uncover connections to other mysterious deaths and the work of Satanist cults in bringing these horrors to life. What jumps off from the exorcism platform is another installment in a familiar franchise. For those who find comfort in the demonic-techno-babble space, this movie will feel like haunted home. It follows a mostly similar formula to religious horror flicks, specifically its own franchise cohorts, but brings just enough freshness to the format to not feel like a rehash. Director, Michael Chaves, has done a beautiful job taking enough of what James Wan did with the first two installments while still making this film is own. Wan is known for the resurrection of the jump-scare, perfecting it in this franchise and Insidious, and Chaves stays true to that style while forging his own path. He uses lighting, quick cuts, and spooky apparitions to keep the tone familiar enough while shedding the door-slam-jump-scares of his predecessor. Chaves nods at his cohorts, with a shot that feels plucked from The Exorcist, another reminiscent of Evil Dead, and moments that feel like The Autopsy of Jane Doe. It’s refreshing to allow other favourites to slip into a franchise that’s already created its own distinct tone. It’s hard to not miss Wan, but Chaves does a good job justifying bringing on fresh (rotting) meat. Wan is not completely absent, however, and has story credit along with screenwriter, David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (who also worked with Wan on Aquaman and The Conjuring 2). This franchise truly belongs in the warm embrace of Farmiga and Wilson who continue to excel. Everything is held together by their warmth and love, and it remains the thread and motivation that keeps everyone alive. Wilson’s concern for his wife’s well-being would make anyone clutch their own beating heart, and their relationship is never better exemplified than when Lorraine enters a dangerous tunnel and asks a concerned Ed to hold her purse. Not to be outdone, O’Connor brings jarring physicality to his role as a young man possessed that is reminiscent of other religious horror flicks that force you to sympathize with an inability to eat, sleep, or quiet the voices. Hilliard (The Haunting of Hill House, WandaVision), though he doesn’t spend a tonne of time on screen, gives the dynamic and heartbreaking dual performance of a tiny demon and an adorable scamp. Thought you’ll be left begging for more, John Noble’s turn as a tortured former priest with a host of warnings for the Warren family, brings a subtle heartbreak to his role that makes him so much more than a walking exposition dump. Eugenie Bondurant as a slender apparition is a welcome addition to the long list of Warren adversaries. Truly, everyone is acting at their best which raises up this otherwise by-the-numbers possession story. The pink goat in the room is the real-life story of Arne Johnson. The hook of these films has always been using the case files of the Warren’s, stories that have been adapted for lots of spooky favourites like The Amityville Horror and The Haunting in Connecticut.  By taking on a more petrifying case, the stakes have been raised to a point where these characters are in impending danger. This time, the demons have taken human life, and the beloved believers are desperately trying to stop it from happening again. The addition of human antagonists pushes this franchise into a darker place which does just enough to revitalize the common premises woven throughout the universe. The Conjuring opened the gates to tell us tales of hauntings, poltergeists, and demons that are based just enough in reality to make us think it could happen to us. By grounding the spooks in tales of love, they’ve put a spin on the familiar that makes us want to hug the paranormal investigator who plays guitar. The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is another take on the same that breathes enough new life into the genre to avoid it ever becoming a rotting corpse. "
4,EMU_Doc4_TheConjuring3,EMU,Horror,Positive,The Conjuring 3,"James Wan's 2013 feature The Conjuring was something special. The haunted house thriller inspired by the real-life investigation of Ed and Lorraine Warren struck a chord with modern audiences and critics alike. Instead of crafting a CGI-heavy shock fest, Wan gave the film humor, heart, genuine scares, and characters that felt real. The same can be said for the impressive follow-up which arrived in theatres in 2016. And now, after a year of dealing with rescheduling due to COVID-19, the third installment is finally here. While The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It finds the return of both Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as Lorraine and Ed, it is the first time Wan has not been directing the fantastic duo – well, aside from their brief inclusion in the enjoyable Annabelle Comes Home. This time, The Curse of la Llorona's Michael Chaves is ready to bring a little bit of supernatural horror to a theatre, or a television, near you with its theatrical and HBO Max release on Friday. It all begins with an exorcism gone wrong. We've seen Ed and Lorraine's success, but here we see what happens when the demonic entity isn't fully vanquished. When a young boy named David Glatzel (Julian Hilliard) barely survives a horrific possession, things become momentarily quiet for the lad, as well as his sister Debbie (Sarah Catherine Hook) and her boyfriend Arne Cheyanne Jackson (Ruairi O'Connor). Yet this family and the Warrens have something far more sinister waiting after a tragic event occurs. After Arne murders his landlord, he is discovered wandering the streets covered in blood. What happened and why did he do it? This crime led to the first U.S. court case where a defendant claimed he was the victim of demonic possession. Was Arne truly becoming host to something evil? Or are there more secrets to be discovered as they come closer to that very answer? I'll leave out the details as this case leads the Warrens on a slightly different type of investigation into the unknown. As a fan of The Conjuring film series, I was concerned bringing in another director with a different vision may not be the best choice for the third film. Thankfully, Michael Chaves has not only continued in the tradition of the first two but he's also added a unique element into the mix, one that brings a bit of devilish fun to the proceedings. Chaves creates a moody and dread-filled horror show, one that works beautifully within the house the Wan built. Much like the previous films, Michael smartly navigates between the human drama and the more horrific images on display. And there are certainly a few spooks and scares to satisfy fans of the series – with the use of fantastic practical effects that will leave you in awe, especially thanks to the incredible contortion work by stunt double Emerald Gordon Wulf. The opening sequence alone is a gut punch and is easily one of the best moments in The Conjuring Universe. As well, the filmmaker manages to bring the same level of empathy to the people existing on-screen. And then there are the franchise regulars. Not surprisingly, Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson shine every moment they’re on-screen in this haunting sequel. The two actors continue to bring something truly refreshing to these big-screen versions of Ed and Lorraine. Certainly, there are some that question whether or not the real-life Warrens did more good than harm – and perhaps that's something that may curb the excitement for a few genre fans. Yet in this cinematic landscape, both actors continue to bring grace, humanity, and warmth to the characters they play. The care and love that they express for each other on-screen translate beautifully in this continuation. As the two grew in the second film, it's clear that both Ms. Farmiga and Mr. Wilson have a deep respect for each other, as well as the roles they've taken on. And yes, the third time is a charm. The film brings the Warrens into contact with the side story from the very beginning. And what a story it is. Sarah Catherine Hook and Ruairi O'Connor are terrific as a young couple facing off against this dark and powerful force. The two are very effective, and they play off the film's main protagonist especially well. Again, the focus on the characters makes it far easier to sympathize with the strange goings-on. In addition, young Julian Hilliard is excellent as a young boy battling for his very soul. It's also nice to see some of the regulars return including Shannon Kook as Drew who works with the Warrens, as well as Steve Coulter as Father Gordon. It's also nice to see the same actress take on the role of Judy Warren with Sterling Jerins' return – McKenna Grace took on the role in the Gary Dauberman directed spin-off Annebelle Comes Home. Much like the previous films, this is a wickedly scary return, with excellent performances from both Farmiga and Wilson. The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is a smart and well-crafted horror sequel. While there may be a small handful of extra jump scares, many of them work rather well. Happily, the third feature still makes excellent use of practical effects and offers a villain that is likely to give you the creeps. Three films in and the original Conjuring franchise still works. This paranormal tale manages to bring something more to your basic big-screen horror show. Even if you might be one of the many ready to pounce and say that without Wan, this series won't work, those willing to resist that bias will surely be entertained as his influence is always clear. While the Satanic element may be a bit surprising – and perhaps there's a slight tongue-in-cheekiness on occasion – there is much to delight in with this frightfully fun sequel. The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It continues to bring a fantastic blend of horror and heart to genre fans everywhere."
5,EMU_Doc5_TheConjuring3,EMU,Horror,Positive,The Conjuring 3,"Two Conjuring films and several spinoffs established a substantial following and a few key expectations. Expect horror’s favorite cinematic couple to encounter terror in notorious haunted house cases, at least one memorable supernatural entity with spinoff appeal, and an endless barrage of effective chills that keep viewers as invested as the central romance. The newest Conjuring movie subverts many expectations for its third outing to ensure this franchise stays fresh and unpredictable. The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It marks a new, exhilarating direction for the series, dialing up the intensity to deliver the darkest entry yet. Opening with a climactic scene that establishes crucial plot points that will run throughout, The Devil Made Me Do It tackles the case of Arne Johnson (Ruairi O’Connor), who murdered his landlord in 1981. His defense? Arne was possessed. Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) were heavily involved with a case involving the family of Johnson’s fiancée, Debbie Glatzel (Sarah Catherine Hook). A significant health crisis took their attention away from the Glatzels until tragedy struck. Now, with Arne facing death row, the Warrens must team up with the local authorities to get to the bottom of it all before it’s too late. At this point of the series, it’s clear that this is no longer James Wan‘s franchise but Wilson and Farmiga’s. Their fictionalized versions of the Warrens bring emotional resonance to these films, and it’s this iteration of Ed and Lorraine that connects so much with audiences. They know their characters well, too. Wan, who has story credit here, knows it. He and screenwriter David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick put even greater emphasis on their romance, raising the stakes even higher for them in the process. Lorraine does the heaviest lifting of all as her powers get tested to their limits, and her adversary presents a diabolical dichotomy. This sequel brings the scary-good fun, but it’s also a poignant love story. Director Michael Chaves shows a keen understanding of the Conjuring films, at once paying homage to both the series and classic horror while fearlessly taking bold swings. The filmmaker’s preference in keeping as much on camera as possible lends to several thrilling and innovative scare moments. The nature of this particular case opens up the world beyond the confines of a haunted house, creating many memorable set pieces as well. This movie might showcase Wilson and Farmiga, but the supporting cast further enriches the sequel with fantastic performances. O’Connor brings surprising physicality to his tormented character, and Julian Hilliard once again charms as a mature soul trapped within an innocent. Look for John Noble to stand out as a haunted character that makes exposition delivery so heartbreaking and compelling. The Devil Made Me Do It draws basis from a true-crime case with actual victims. The previous entries featured zero human victims, which already establishes the darker, more mature tone here. Johnson-McGoldrick, Wan, and Chaves take it a step further by dabbling with an even darker threat that removes any sense of safety for the protagonists and supporting players. The Warrens’ unwavering devotion to each other offsets the body count and grim subject matter. The result is a thrilling new entry full of surprises and hair-raising intensity that zips along and leaves you clamoring for more. Chaves seamlessly takes the reins from Wan and runs with it, bringing a wholly different experience that still feels like a warm reunion with horror’s favorite couple."
6,EMU_Doc6_TheConjuring3,EMU,Horror,Positive,The Conjuring 3,"Right from the first movie, James Wan had bigger plans for The Conjuring universe than just a straightforward series of horror movies. The Conjuring spawned the Annabelle franchise and then The Conjuring 2 saw the series go into full MCU mode, including several different baddies intended for future spin-offs (although so far we've only had The Nun). We've even had a surprise Conjuring universe movie in The Curse of La Llorona, thanks to an unexpected crossover character. It's easy to forget that the basis of the series was in the real-life experiences of demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren. The third movie in the 'main' series, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, however, takes it back to basics – and it proves to be a terrifying fresh direction. Gone (mostly) are the nods to previous movies and any set-up for future ones, with the movie solely focusing on the darkest case of the Warrens' career: the trial of Arne Cheyenne Johnson. Back in 1981, Johnson killed his landlord and when it came to the trial, he claimed demonic possession as a defence to his actions. It was believed the demon came from a previous exorcism of David Glatzel, the younger brother of Johnson's girlfriend Debbie, where both he and the Warrens were in attendance. The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It's intense opening will terrify you whether you believe in demons or not. It centres on the exorcism of David Glatzel and sees director Michael Chaves unashamedly lean into The Exorcist, right down to the arrival of the priest, and it'll satisfy any horror fan. With some impressive practical effects, it's a breathless start and hints that this isn't a typical Conjuring movie as the Warrens don't succeed. The effects of that failure see Johnson (played by Ruairi O'Connor) plagued by the same demon that had a hold on David Glatzel, eventually leading to Johnson fatally stabbing his landlord. It's here when the Warrens got back involved (both in real life and in the movie), but The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It doesn't become a courtroom drama. In real life, the defence was thrown out fairly quickly, which doesn't leave much of a movie. Chaves and writer David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick instead turn the movie into CSI: Conjuring as the Warrens investigate the apparent possession of Johnson. As in the previous Conjuring movies, the plot sets up the scares and also delves into the relationship between Ed and Lorraine Warren. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are terrific, unsurprisingly, and it's pleasing that the third movie sees Farmiga take on a more central role. If it's not quite a ""love story"" as Farmiga says, there are still some sweet moments between the two that add to the heightened emotion of the finale. What's impressive is that we know both of them are going to be OK, yet their committed performances mean we're always nervous. Chaves puts them in some brilliantly-crafted set pieces, including an unforgettable morgue sequence, that test the pair to their limits and they never fail. Horror performances aren't recognised enough, and Wilson and Farmiga deserve every plaudit going. While their investigation is mostly fictional, it does show some fascinating insight into how the Warrens started to work more with police on these kinds of cases. It brings a new angle to the series as we're not seeing the Warrens investigate a haunting house as it happens, while Chaves also adds moments of levity that we're just not used to seeing in this series. Chaves is clearly a horror fan too and doesn't forget to keep the scares coming at a regular pace, even when Lorraine Warren is busy being a paranormal detective. There are nods to several horror classics and rather than feeling like a rip-off, they feel like a loving homage and add an extra level to the set pieces that will leave you peering into every shadow. If you're being especially critical, you might also take umbrage with the movie using a real-life case of murder as the jumping point for a fictional horror tale, one that has no nuance in terms of what happened to Johnson. This movie, as the others have in the series, treats demons as very real, because that's how the Warrens viewed it and the Conjuring series is their story. That's unlikely to bother fans of the series though as it's what they expect, although The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It still brings them something new too. You might not believe that the devil made him do it, but you will be terrified."
7,EMU_Doc7_TheConjuring3,EMU,Horror,Negative,The Conjuring 3,"Money is no issue for The Conjuring films. The series is one of the biggest, most convoluted studio IPs that doesn’t derive from comic books, and the core films of James Wan’s demonic Catholic cinematic universe are some of the most expensive looking horror films being made today. They’re wonderfully period accurate with beautiful touches, incredible camera rigging, and detailed costuming. Extravagant set pieces be damned, though – including a well-executed scene involving a luxurious waterbed – The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It doesn’t live up to the bone-chilling focus, simplicity, and direction of Wan’s first film in this bloated eight-part series. The Devil Made Me Do It director Michael Chaves replicates Wan’s flair the best he can, with sweeping wide shots of gorgeous houses and quiet, misleading spooky sequences that erect into clutch-your-pearls jump scares. There’s even a visual callback to the first film’s signature scare, an attempt to recreate the tension of Lili Taylor’s infamous basement clap game by stuffing Vera Farmiga, who plays medium Lorraine Warren, in a tiny crawlspace under the obligatory cursed family home. Chaves is a smooth copycat, much better at recreating Wan’s vision than the Annabelle and Nun spinoffs that swirl around the main series, to a point where it’s debatable as to how much of the directorial reigns Chaves held, and if The Devil Made Me Do It was even half as good as its genre neighbor, Poltergeist, this could be a film where people debated the truth behind the director credit for decades. But to buy into The Devil Made Me Do It, Chaves, Wan, and co-writer David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick ask you to buy into the innocence of a small-town upstanding gentleman, Arne (O’Connor), who couldn’t have possibly murdered the boss and landlord of his girlfriend, Debbie Glatzel (Hook). The series being based on the case files of the real-life Warrens, two notorious con artists who profited off desperate people, was never much of a distraction until this particular entry. The Devil Made Me Do It showcases Ed Warren (Wilson) and wife Lorraine hopping around the judicial system, proving the existence of demons, and defeating skepticism in ways that Dana Scully and Fox Mulder could never. Set in the thick of the Satanic Panic, the Warrens sincere case of Arne’s innocence is disturbing, negligent, and even dangerous. The Devil Made Me Do It twists reality (in truth, the demon defense was not accepted in court), and plays it up as fact, something that’s not often an issue but in an age where conspiracy is increasingly running amok, this entry feels a bit more misguided. The Devil Made Me Do It’s mystery is weighed down in explosive set pieces and grander acts of devotion, both religious and martial, which loses the focus of the (albeit dull) setup. An overlong climax that channels both The Exorcist and The Shining is tired by tropes, snapping back and forth between Arne’s battle against the evil forces that still possess him in jail and the Warrens' even grander battle against the Big Bad Occult-Obsessed Witch who is the baddie pulling the strings. There’s an explicit theme of “love conquers all,” as seen in both Debbie and Arne’s loyalty and the Warrens’ ongoing blistering passion. It’s a thread that clicks more in the preceding films, and one that is exhausted in this entry. It’s disappointing to stop rooting for a blockbuster behemoth horror series, but The Conjuring movies’ quality and talon-tight hold has rapidly deflated over time. The films have lost sight of what made them grand, escapist, and celebrated, and burning the “based on true events” marquee to evoke sympathy in this particular case is disengaging."
8,EMU_Doc8_TheConjuring3,EMU,Horror,Negative,The Conjuring 3,"When a film trots out the phrase “based on a true story,” that can mean a lot of things, from a meticulous recreation of well-documented events (albeit with some dramatic license) to a largely constructed fiction that borrows a couple of ostensibly true elements from a preexisting story. But if the “true story” in question already has a complicated relationship with veracity? Well … then you get “The Conjuring” films. The latest installment in the increasingly sprawling horror franchise is “The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It.” It’s the third “Conjuring” film proper, though there have been a number of spin-off/tangentially connected movies as well. Directed by Michael Chaves from a screenplay by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, it’s a continuation of the supernatural adventures of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. As with any franchise, the law of diminishing returns is in play; this one is no exception. While it does feature some solid performances and a couple of decent jump scares, the truth is that this new offering doesn’t reach the level of the previous two films in the series. In 1981, Ed (Patrick Wilson, “Midway”) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga, “Godzilla: King of the Monsters”) Warren are participating in an exorcism, attempting to rid eight-year-old David Glatzel (Jullian Hilliard, TV’s “WandaVision”) of the demonic presence possessing him. His parents are there by his side, as are his sister Debbie (Sarah Catherine Hook in her feature debut) and Debbie’s boyfriend Arne (Ruairi O’Connor, “The Postcard Killings”). But when things go awry and David starts hurting people, chaos ensues. And in the midst of that chaos – which includes Ed suffering a serious heart attack and David’s dad getting stabbed in the leg – Arne takes it upon himself to try and rectify the situation. He invites the demon inside David to take him instead. You can probably guess how well that plays out. It isn’t long before Arne’s own situation begins to spiral. And when the demon inside him drives him to commit a horrific act of violence, he finds himself imprisoned, in shackles and awaiting a trial for a crime that, depending on your perspective, he didn’t actually commit. The Warrens begin investigating the situation in an effort to free Arne and prove, for the first time in a courtroom, that it was in fact the devil that made him do it. “The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It” bills itself as based on a true story. That phrasing is even trickier than usual here because of the reputation of the real-life Ed and Lorraine Warren as deluded dupes at best and grifting charlatans at worst. Is this film based on the “true story” as put forth by the Warrens? Sure. Is that story ACTUALLY true? All signs point to no. That said, the veracity of the source material has little to do with the movie itself, at least in this case. The relative truth or untruth of the account doesn’t matter – it’s a movie, after all. And a horror movie at that. If it’s effective as a film, the rest is immaterial. Unfortunately, it isn’t. There’s something absent from “TDMMDI,” the spark that made the first film (and to a slightly lesser extent, the second) work. As portrayed on-screen, the work done by the Warrens is spooky and terrifying and dangerous, charged with a sense of precariousness. It’s a balancing act, with the Warrens standing at the fulcrum preventing others from being trapped forever in darkness. But that sense of balance never fully comes through here. This film is absolutely lousy with standard-issue tropes. The exorcism and possession scenes are grisly, but grisly in the same way they’ve been shown on film for decades now. The various subplots all feel rote, as if they’ve simply been copied from other (and better) films. There’s just nothing much about this film that feels new. Even if you leave aside the fact that this is the third film in the series and the eighth (!) in the franchise overall, there has to be room for something new. Instead, it’s all retread and rehash, a churn of greatest hits that is less than the sum of its parts. None of the blame for this should be placed on the cast, though. Frankly, the only reason this film works as much as it does is because of the work being put in by Patrick Wilson and especially Vera Farmiga. Both are talented actors who have never quite received the credit those talents warrant, though their presence in this franchise likely helps their bottom lines even if it doesn’t burnish their reputations. Still, they bring a screwball-adjacent energy to the Warrens, which works well even in the horror context; their chemistry is enough to keep the film afloat as it thrashes through its convoluted-yet-familiar narrative beats. The supporting cast does fine work as well, if not quite to the level of Wilson and Farmiga. Playing the possessed in these sorts of films is a weird and complicated gig, but both Hilliard and O’Connor handle it well. O’Connor’s general gormlessness serves as a nice counterpoint to when things get nuts. If her work here in her feature debut is any indication, Hook might be one to watch – it’s a thankless role, but she handles herself well. John Noble, Eugenie Bondurant and Ronnie Gene Blevins also do solid work in roles that I won’t delve into; spoiler, you know? No, this film falls short due to the generally uninspired direction of Chaves and the murky messiness of Johnson-McGoldrick’s script. It’s expected that a film series will gradually dip in quality, but this is far more of a drop-off than you might anticipate. It more or less maintains the standard “The Conjuring” ethos, but fails to find any sort of real resonance. “The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It” is a mediocre extension of a cinematic universe that may have reached its sell-by date. There are flashes, but for the most part, it simply fails to engage. Big picture, one could argue it’s OK, but hey – the devil is in the details."
9,EMU_Doc9_TheConjuring3,EMU,Horror,Negative,The Conjuring 3,"The so-called ""Conjuring universe"" is so successful, it’s scary. The franchise of horror films built around the exploits of married ghostbusters Ed and Lorraine Warren has scared up a tidy $1.8 billion in box office revenues since the first Conjuring movie debuted in 2013. The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, is the third official film in the series, which also encompasses three Annabelle movies and The Nun. It’s also perhaps the least likable of the series. Proximity may have something to do with that. The best film of the bunch was the last one, Annabelle Comes Home, a fun haunted-house romp reminiscent of some goofy William Castle thrillers of yesteryear. Part of its appeal was that it jettisoned the religious overtones that run through many of the other films. Conjuring 3, by comparison, seems a bloviating affair, layering a few Exorcist references for all to see, but never once matching that 1973 classic for its take-no-prisoners approach to screen horror. As the film begins, in the year 1981, we find Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) at a remote farmhouse attempting to exorcise a malevolent spirit that has taken hold of a young boy (Julian Hilliard), bending the kid like a Stretch Armstrong doll. Also in attendance is the kid’s older sister Debbie (Sarah Catherine Hook) and her boyfriend Arne (Ruairi O’Connor) who, in an effort to impress his girlfriend, invites the demon to possess him instead. The demon obliges, but in the chaos, only Ed notices, and he is quickly sidelined by a badly timed heart attack. When he regains consciousness, he tells Lorraine to warn the family. Alas, by this time, Arne has apparently been possessed and has attacked his landlord, who is so obnoxious, one can’t help think there might be a viable defence for justifiable homicide. Nope, Arne’s defence attorney opts to plead ""not guilty by reason of demonic possession"" at Ed and Lorraine’s urging. Ed reasons that since God comes up during a swearing-in ceremony, it’s high time the devil got his due in the legal system. (A reminder: This is actually based on a real case.) Now the couple just has to find some kind of proof of possession, a journey that will see them investigate another murder and consult with the retired priest Kastner (John Noble), who happens to have a basement filled with evil artifacts to rival Ed and Lorraine’s own demonic rec room. Kastner seems to know what the Warrens are up against and warns them: ""A master Satanist is not an adversary to be taken lightly.” Indeed, when the ""occultist"" reveals herself (Eugenie Bondurant is thin as a razor and just as intimidating) the stage is set for a double-whammy climax involving Arne in the penitentiary while Ed and Lorraine confront their evil adversary. Director Michael Chaves arrives at this film after directing the disappointing The Curse of la Llorona, a Hollywood-ized take on a chilling figure from Mexican horror mythology. While he delivers plenty of the requisite ooga-booga with technical skill, the film never really achieves the friction to create an authentic frisson of fear. In the role of exorcism’s ""it couple,"" Wilson is his likable sincere self, and one could forgive Farmiga anything because she’s always good, even as the telepathically endowed Lorraine. But even they’re starting to induce pain like that spiked cilice Paul Bettany wore on his thigh in the role of a zealous Catholic assassin in The Da Vinci Code: a constant reminder of the Conjuring’s dogmatic premise that there’s no evil that can’t be dispersed with a spritz of holy water."
10,EMU_Doc10_TheConjuring3,EMU,Horror,Negative,The Conjuring 3,"I remember seeing James Wan’s The Conjuring for the first time in 2017 and being completely petrified during the entire runtime to the point where I couldn’t sleep at night. The film was so effective at utilizing familiar horror cues, such as jump scares, and reinventing them in a way where it would fit its increasingly eerie atmosphere and become amazingly scary. Wan is extremely literate with classic horror and knows exactly how to subvert tropes to pull the audience in, and his two Conjuring films are the only good pictures in this ever-expansive “cinematic universe” filled with pedantic spinoff films such as the Annabelle trilogy (with a somewhat decent middle chapter by David F. Sandberg), the dreadful The Nun and the awfully generic The Curse of La Llorona. When it was announced that La Llorona filmmaker Michael Chaves would helm the latest installment in the saga of Ed and Lorraine Warren, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, warning signs were already flashing in the back of my mind. Not only was La Llorona a terribly ordinary horror film filled with the most predictable and unimaginative jump scares you can possibly think of, it also had a drab digital aesthetic and an extremely convoluted story. The streak continues for Chaves, as The Devil Made Me Do It manages to turn the most exciting supernatural horror I’ve seen since Richard Donner’s The Omen into a tedious jump scare-filled picture that’s not only uninterested in what it wants to say, but is also exceedingly unscary. The film does start promisingly, however, with a cathartic exorcism scene with many cues recalling William Friedkin’s The Exorcist, such as the famous shot of a hat-wearing priest looking out at the house where he’ll perform the exorcism. Unlike Father Merrin, the priest (barely) survives the exorcism and causes Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) to have a heart attack. After the possessed child, David Glatzel (Julian Hilliard), performs gruesome contortions with his body and almost kills Ed, Arne Johnson (Ruairi O’Connor), asks the demon to take him instead of David, which it does. Ed and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) now investigate the origins of the demon that possessed David and Arne, which is quickly revealed to be a curse. This opening scene supposedly sets the stage for what’s to come: effective scares with several “oh my god” moments sprinkled throughout. However, after its traditional text crawl, the movie stops dead in its tracks and starts becoming the most generic horror film I’ve seen since The Curse of La Llorona. After its opening scene, The Devil Made Me Do It rapidly turns into predictable fluff, with jump scares featuring horribly loud musical cues and fake outs you see coming a mile away. Here’s the thing: there is nothing more annoying than a predictable jump scare. Jump scares aren’t scary — they’re either obnoxiously loud, formularized or both. The only film that was able to achieve the overuse of jump scares in recent memory was Andy Muschietti’s 2017 remake of It, but only after it established Pennywise as a terrifying creature. The projector scene is a classic example of that—you can see the scare coming a mile away, but you don’t expect to see Pennywise leaping out of the screen and running to attack the children. The Devil Made Me Do It strictly uses the jump scare with the intent of giving the audience an adrenaline rush, and make them think that it’s scary, but when you exactly know when it’s going to happen, without any suspension of disbelief, it then becomes very hard to impress, even if the film desperately wants to. The Devil Made Me Do It wants to impress with jump scares, because it doesn’t have a compelling story to tell. It has a shell of an interesting story, but never fully fleshes it out and, as a result, becomes confusing. I’ll admit that, during the final act, I had absolutely no clue what was going on with Ed and Lorraine. The film is so busy setting up the next jump scare that it completely forgets about crafting a great story to invest the audience in. Heck, before any legitimate scares happened, the first Conjuring film sets up interesting characters and a somewhat decent story before blowing the audience away and traumatizing them in the process. The only ones that truly seem to care in this instalment are, of course, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as the Warrens. Their chemistry is as good as it ever was, and they’re also the only convincing actors in the entire film. Every other character is either thinly developed and/or performed in a way you’ll immediately forget about after walking out of the theatre. Everyone seems so uninterested in trying to figure out the film’s non-mystery that it becomes very easy for us audience members to check out and stop giving a damn. It really is a shame, because the previous Conjuring films (not the spinoffs) cared about the story they were telling — always setting up the story before the scares, and building it in a way that it became incredibly effective once the pin drops would happen, because the audience would be invested in the story. In The Devil Made Me Do It, the scares happen too quickly, too many times, without any story being initially set-up. Jump scares aren’t scary, as I’ve previously mentioned, and The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It really wants you to think they are terrifying. Yet, there’s nothing terrifying about speakers cranking up to 11, in a Merzbow-like sound design, in which the film’s quieter sequences have barely perceptible dialogues, almost as if the characters are whispering to one another, but the so-called “scary scenes” are overbearingly loud. If this film will be your return to theatres, be forewarned that it could be the loudest film you’ll see all year. The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is only loud for the sake of being loud, because it’s apparently cooler to experience loud noises on the big screen and have a collective experience of the most formulaic haunted house sounds you could ever imagine. Yes, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are excellent, but it’s clearly not enough to save the movie from being something else other than an unimaginative bore, filled with cheap “scares” and an uninteresting story that’s not even being fleshed out for its audience. It’s finally time to retire this franchise once and for all, unless Wan miraculously comes back. If not, lock it in the Warrens’ MacGuffin room forever and ever, until someone (unfortunately) opens it again."
11,JKQ_Doc1_MissionImpossibleFallout,JKQ,Action,Positive,Mission Impossible Fallout,"Tom Cruise is the cinema’s greatest action star. Fortunately, such a hyperbolic claim is not without an argument to back it up. Around the dawn of the last century, Douglas Fairbanks swashbuckled his way to fame by climbing walls, riding horses, and swinging from ropes in titles like The Mark of Zorro (1920) or Robin Hood (1922). Although Fairbanks was an accomplished gymnast, he eventually conceded to use stunt doubles for the most daring feats. After Fairbanks, Errol Flynn took the crown, having shot his own arrows and performed dangerous sword fights in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) and The Sea Hawk (1940). In the subsequent decades, actors including Tyrone Power, Bruce Lee, Harrison Ford, Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and others became action icons, but few could actually perform the exploits of their characters and instead relied on the talents of stunt workers. Perhaps because their skills are evident onscreen, martial artists have dominated cinematic bravado in recent decades, allowing for Jackie Chan and Jason Statham to impress with their ability to carry out elaborately choreographed fights. But how many of these actors, from Fairbanks to Chan, have tied themselves to the side of a plane? How many have driven at top speeds in fast-paced motorcycle races, hung from a helicopter midair, climbed mountains without a net, outran an exploding aquarium, or held his breath underwater for several minutes? How many have dangled on the tallest building in the world? Only Cruise has subjected himself to such exploits and more for the sake of screen action, and the above-listed examples remain restricted to the Mission: Impossible franchise, still going strong since its dazzling Brian De Palma debut in 1996. The sixth entry, Mission: Impossible – Fallout, contains some series-best spectacles, among them a memorable car chase to rival the one in The French Connection (1971), brutal hand-to-hand combat, and a breathless helicopter chase—for which Cruise learned to fly helicopters and then piloted his own craft in the film. Director Christopher McQuarrie, who captained the previous entry, Rogue Nation, sells every incredible set-piece not just because he realizes the proceedings in such a clearly presented way, complete with an effortless shot-by-shot logic and visual cohesion, but because Cruise sells the most unbelievable moments in the film by actually performing them. There’s almost no reliance on stage pieces or CGI, allowing, subconsciously, the viewer to recognize, somewhere in the back of our minds, that what we’re seeing onscreen is real—as opposed to the usual Hollywood confection. Cruise and McQuarrie engross the viewer by making the most outlandish stunts look and feel like they really happened. More than the first two titles in the Mission: Impossible franchise, the last few have maintained a relatively steady character base and plot after J.J. Abrams reinvigorated the material in 2006. But Fallout follows closely the events and characters from Rogue Nation, and even maintains the same villain and supporting players. IMF point man Ethan Hunt, backed by his behind-the-scenes tech support Luther (Ving Rhames) and his other techie-turned-field-man Benji (Simon Pegg), operates under the close watch of their new department head, Secretary Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin). Hunt’s team has been tasked with taking down The Apostles, a terrorist faction devoted to the notion that “the greater the suffering, the greater the peace”—hence their resolution to cause as much suffering across the globe as possible. The Apostles follow in the footsteps of their former leader, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), who was imprisoned by Hunt and Co. at the end of the last film. One of Lane’s devotees named John Lark, presumably a double-agent in U.S. intelligence, hopes to acquire three plutonium cores in an effort to create three nuclear weapons. Hunt’s team accepts the  impossible mission to identify Lark, recover the cores, and stop Lane’s Apostles once and for all. At the same time, the CIA’s Director Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) demands one of her agents, the towering brute August Walker (Henry Cavill), oversee Hunt’s progress. She calls Walker the hammer to Hunt’s scalpel, and more than once Walker’s unsubtle approach turns the IMF’s carefully laid plans to bare. Returning to the mix is Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson), a former MI6 agent who walked away from her life of undercover spying in Lane’s Syndicate. Which is to say, it’s helpful if Fallout’s audience remembers the events in Rogue Nation, even Mission: Impossible III, to appreciate in full the emotional significance of the events here. To be sure, Hunt’s estranged wife, played by Michelle Monaghan, makes several appearances in the film, lending to Hunt’s characterization as a man driven by a terrifying fear that, should Lane and his cohorts succeed, he’ll be unable to save the people who matter most to him. For Sloan, Hunt’s willingness to sacrifice the success of an entire mission, in which millions of lives hang in the balance, in exchange for a single life, means the agent has been compromised. The script, written by McQuarrie, rewards those who pay close attention to the plot machinations and twists throughout, without dwelling on moments or dumbing them down for an inattentive audience. About mid-film, an unassuming sequence that takes place in a series of underground tunnels contains about three twists and double-crosses in a matter of minutes, each more effective and unpredictable than the last, and McQuarrie allows them to unfold thoughtfully, trusting his audience to keep up. Not that it requires much to follow the story, as McQuarrie efficiently sketches out the stakes early in the film’s breezes-by, two-and-a-half-hour runtime. The structure, modeled after the Hitchcockian ideal of grabbing the viewer from the first sequence and not letting go, never allows the viewer a moment of ease. Alfred Hitchcock has long been an influence on the franchise, from the elegantly conceived set-pieces, to the wrong-man-thriller elements, to the way each film forces the viewer to hold their breath until the last possible moment. Throughout the remainder, the audience follows along, either invested in the weighty dramatic arcs for characters like Hunt, Ilsa, and Benji, or attuned to the remarkable action. Most viewers will walk away from Fallout exhilarated, talking about Cruise’s stunts or the downright exhausting chases (by motorcycle, automobile, helicopter, and foot), but the story rewards those invested in the characters. And while McQuarrie’s script contains less humor or moments of levity than the previous two sequels, the lofty threat of nuclear genocide and personal loss intensify the stakes more than previous missions. McQuarrie began his string of collaborations with Tom Cruise as the screenwriter of Valkyrie (2008); he later directed the actor on Jack Reacher (2012), and also contributed to the deft scripting on Edge of Tomorrow (2014). Even with McQuarrie’s accomplished filmmaking on Rogue Nation, his work on Fallout is a leap in craft and skill. He’s elevated himself from a screenwriter-turned-director to an extraordinarily accomplished visualist with a fully realized aesthetic. Shot by Rob Hardy (Annihilation), there’s a soft, Nolan-esque sheen to the proceedings, recalling the look of Inception or The Dark Knight. Hardy’s rather straightforward, plainly presented lensing of the action, along with Eddie Hamilton’s editing, capture the daring and death-defying stunts in all their considerable glory. The production seems engineered to make the most of Cruise’s devotion to action realism, particularly in the last 20 minutes when Hunt inches up a payload rope attached to the bottom of a helicopter, guides himself inside to the front of the craft, and then takes over above the mountains of Kashmir, India—a stunt marked by its balance of suspense amid beautiful scenery. What’s more, Cruise performs some extraordinary motorcycle work, becomes the first actor to perform a high-altitude skydive, and runs in a wowing extended pursuit (he has long been Hollywood’s best runner). Any of these sequences is incomparable, and yet Fallout is filled with them. Then again, McQuarrie and the 56-year-old Cruise are unafraid to acknowledge that the star may be dimming. Opposite the broad-shouldered Cavill (today’s Superman), who towers over Cruise, Hunt isn’t the invincible hero he once was. In Fallout, he’s out of his depth more than once, which, of course, makes the film all the more thrilling. Over the course of six films, the Mission: Impossible franchise has remained mostly consistent (with the exception of the abominable second film by director John Woo), deepening its hold on viewers with each new entry. With Fallout, McQuarrie delivers not only the best film in the franchise after De Palma’s slick original, but one of the great films of artfully photographed and technically monumental action—to be included on a list alongside other titles of similarly grand scope and design: The Road Warrior (1982), Aliens (1986), Die Hard (1988), Heat (1997), Skyfall (2012), and Mad Max: Fury Road (2015). Above all, Fallout reminds us that neither Cruise’s talent nor the enduring quality of his Mission: Impossible films should be taken for granted. Each new sequel attempts something new, something we’ve never seen before, and does this with a sense of spy-thriller panache that no other action franchise has matched with such unbridled showmanship and consistent, keeps-you-guessing story. Audiences will be watching McQuarrie’s direction and Cruise’s stuntwork for years to come, reflecting with a sense of awe over how they accomplished what they did, and how rare it is that the filmmakers took the risk to achieve it."
12,JKQ_Doc2_MissionImpossibleFallout,JKQ,Action,Positive,Mission Impossible Fallout,"Ethan Hunt must deal with a returning terrorist villain, a new group of zealots and an interfering CIA operative in his latest very improbable mission. Being a film critic is the best job in the world – obviously. Sometimes, though, it’s easy to lose sight of that. Sitting through the latest noisy installment in the Transformers franchise, or enduring a comedy that’s about as funny as a Brexit white paper, is enough to make even the most devoted cinephile question their career decisions. Thank goodness, then, for movies like Mission: Impossible – Fallout. It’s a stupid, ridiculous, shlocky romp so enjoyable that it restores every lost iota of faith in cinema to amaze, enthrall and excite. Not bad for the sixth film in a fairly generic collection of action movies. For the first time in the 20 year history of the franchise, there’s a returning director at the helm, with Christopher McQuarrie picking up where he left off after the fun but forgettable Rogue Nation back in 2015. Alec Baldwin’s CIA suit is now in charge of the IMF and he has tasked Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) with tracking down a trio of plutonium devices before they fall into the clutches of the Apostles – a group of zealots formed from the ashes of the Syndicate, whose founder Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) is ricocheting around between the law enforcement systems of various nations. A calamitous decision made by Hunt in the heat of battle leads to the plutonium vanishing into criminal hands and the interference of CIA assassin Walker (Henry Cavill), who is despatched to keep an eye on Hunt and his IMF team as they try to recover the radioactive material before it can become weaponised. Things are complicated further by the reappearance of former MI6 operative Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who has her own set of missions and loyalties. McQuarrie has woven yet another tapestry of double crosses and conspiracies with Fallout, though it’s clear that this is not where the lion’s share of his enthusiasm lies. This movie’s storyline is little more than a skeleton, on to which McQuarrie and producer-star-daredevil Cruise assemble an elaborate musculature of set pieces that are as inventive as they are dangerous. Whether it’s a bruising bathroom fight, a motorbike chase through the streets of a major European city or an aerial battle in which helicopters become high altitude dodgem cars, McQuarrie and his fearless leading man pull out all the stops to batter the audience into submission. And it’s in this quest that the film whole-heartedly succeeds. There is action in this movie to rival anything in the best genre adventures of recent years, from Mad Max: Fury Road‘s vehicular carnage to the superhero smackdowns of Avengers: Infinity War. The climactic face-off, atop a towering Asian cliff, is a bruising battle of fists that is as cathartically funny as it is stunningly violent. It’s a movie that almost dares the audience to engage in their own daredevil stunt – holding their breath for the entire third act. It helps, too, that this franchise is now fully embracing its ludicrousness like an old friend. There’s a running gag characterising the IMF as “a bunch of grown men in rubber masks playing trick or treat” and Simon Pegg’s tech whizz Benji has dialled up the exasperation even further. This new incarnation of Mission: Impossible marks the swaggering confidence of a series that, after decades of tinkering, has found its identity as a cartoonish demolition derby, anchored by its Cruise missile of a star – willing to dangle from, and ultimately jump off, as many tall things as he can find. These movies belong to Cruise, and it’s easy to see why. Undaunted by either his advancing years, or the smashed-up ankle he sustained during filming in London, the 56-year-old man of mayhem is a whirlwind running through almost every frame of the movie’s two and a half hours – a lot on paper, but it flies by – in a constant quest to one-up his own excesses. He’s amply supported by his usual ensemble, but he equally benefits from Henry Cavill, effectively reprising the sneering arrogance of his character in The Man From U.N.C.L.E. in a role that is as enjoyable as anything he has done in his big screen career. McQuarrie’s comfort equally shines through in the visual finesse on show throughout the film. Interior scenes have a retro grain, while the aforementioned finale unfolds against an eclectic climate, changing from snow-capped peaks to the verdant beauty of greenery in the blink of an eye, each captured with an eye for sheer beauty by cinematographer Rob Hardy. The sound design, too, deserves credit for some crunching punches and deafening chases, while Lorne Balfe’s score mixes old and new with a seamless sense of the same kid-in-a-sweet-shop joy that powers the whole movie. It’s not a straight slam dunk, though. Michelle Monaghan, returning as Hunt’s estranged ex-wife, hands the film an entirely unnecessary emotional subplot that never works, despite the best efforts of Ving Rhames in a beefed-up role as hacker Luther. Rhames shines in his comedy moments – including a particularly fraught attempt to defuse a bomb – but struggles to do as much emotional heavy-lifting as the script asks of him. Equally, a British society dirty dealer played by The Crown‘s Vanessa Kirby adds an injection of strange energy when she’s on screen, but ultimately flits in and out of the narrative without much rhyme or reason. These complaints, however, are a mere footnote in the face of the towering achievement that Mission: Impossible – Fallout transpires to be. In a movie world in which even the biggest films often feel as if they are holding plenty back for sequels, it’s a joy to experience a blockbuster bonanza that genuinely feels as if it’s tossing absolutely everything it has at the audience in an attempt to deliver pure, unadulterated escapism. It’s possible for a film critic to lose sight of the joy of cinema, for sure, but after I spent the last 20 minutes of Fallout repeating the words “I bloody love movies” in my head, I’d say I’m in a good place for the moment."
13,JKQ_Doc3_MissionImpossibleFallout,JKQ,Action,Positive,Mission Impossible Fallout,"Mission: Impossible – Fallout (2018) is the best entry into the Mission: Impossible series and is the best action film since Mad Max: Fury Road (2015). Throughout this latest adventure, we hear super agent Ethan Hunt utter the phrase, “I won’t let you down.” While that plays as a crucial element in the plot, we can also examine it from the actor who delivers the line. Tom Cruise, at fifty six years young, seems to be talking directly at us – the audience – letting us know that he will give us exactly what we’re looking for: high octane action and death defying stunts. Cruise is one of the last movie stars of his kind, combining his immense screen presence with a keen understanding of how to entertain. He is the ultimate showman, able to adapt to changing times. Although he has had his fair share of duds, he never goes into a project without full commitment. Think about this: the Mission: Impossible series has gone on for over twenty years and is only getting better. Where many action stars fade the older they get, Cruise rushes forward, pushing the limit (both physically and mentally) for our enjoyment. But Fallout isn’t just the “Tom Cruise Show.” Here now is the emergence of Christopher McQuarrie as an elite action director. The previous entry, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015) was great fun and had plenty of intrigue, but Fallout tops it with its set pieces, intricate plotting, and breathless pacing. The balance between practical effects and CGI is perfectly handled. To a larger degree is an emotional factor that catches us off guard. We get all the thrills that we expect and yet McQuarrie (who also wrote screenplay) sneaks in a character study that makes the material all the richer. The cinematography (Rob Hardy) is assured and confident. We see everything clearly, the framing allowing us to witness Cruise in full view of his numerous stunt work. Eddie Hamilton’s editing cuts between shots with clarity. At no point is there confusion in the geography of a set piece. Lorne Balfe’s score is pulse pounding, calling to mind the feel of a crime thriller. Breaking the episodic nature of the series, Fallout acts as a direct sequel to Rogue Nation. This time we see Ethan dealing with the moral dilemma of being an agent – whether or not its better to sacrifice one life if it means saving millions more. That idea has always existed in the background of the previous entries, but here is where it comes to full fruition. Ethan is a man who cannot fathom making the hard choice; he would rather sacrifice himself than see a single person perish. It’s that weakness that causes Ethan and his partners Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg) to lose a case of plutonium into the hands of bad guys, putting many lives at risk. But that weakness is also Ethan’s greatest strength, motivating him to track down the plutonium with unrelenting obsession. Why does Ethan feel the need to go out on a limb even when the goal appears unreachable? The answer is the same with many other movie heroes: because he has to. Ethan saves lives because he must, and he does it like no one else. Along for the ride is CIA agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) assigned to keep a watchful eye over Ethan and his team. There’s also the reappearance of the mysterious British agent Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson), and Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) the villain of Rogue Nation who has returned with destruction and chaos on his mind. After an early expository scene, McQuarrie puts his foot on the gas and never lets up. Fallout constantly moves, even the quieter, character driven moments are designed with urgency. Ethan tackles his mission like a mad man, and Cruise tackles his role in the same vein. Cruise performs a HALO jump, goes on high speed chases in a truck, in a car, and on a motorcycle through the streets of Paris, engages in a brutal hand to hand fight inside of a nightclub bathroom – and this is all happens before he famously broke his ankle jumping from one rooftop to another (the shot is used in the movie). All throughout, McQuarrie makes the precise right decisions on how to depict the action. The bathroom fight scene is done with no music, allowing us to hear and feel every punch. The motorcycle chase is shot from three angles (in front of the bike, to the side, and from behind), ensuring that we can see Cruise is the one driving it, narrowly missing being smacked by a passing car. During a rescue operation, a character is stuck inside of a truck slowly submerging into the Seine river. The camera inside captures the rising water sideways like a growing wall coming to take its victim. McQuarrie’s biggest improvement as a director is by building the tension all the way up to the climax. In Rogue Nation and Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011) the key set piece always happened right in the middle of the plot, causing the third act to sink just a bit. That is not the case with Fallout, in which the final showdown is a spectacular feat of imagination, execution, and fearlessness. I dare not describe it to you and spoil the fun. Not enough can be said about Cruise’s fantastic performance. Not only in the physical sense (at one point he runs so hard that it looks like he’s about to take off) but also as a dynamic, fully developed character. To Ethan, every life matters. Occasionally, McQuarrie will bring the narrative to a standstill and focus in on Cruise’s face during a moment of emotional conflict, where he is faced with a decision he simply does not want to make. Every instance of this is effective, causing us to understand that Ethan is not a machine, but a flesh a blood person whose acts of violence against others leave a lasting effect. Mission: Impossible – Fallout is the kind of movie that causes people to fall in love with movies. The craftsmanship is stellar, the performances are great, the action awe-inspiring, and the story deeply involving. Being a film fan means being in a constant search for an experience that puts us on the edge of our seats and grab the armrests with excitement. This delivers that in spades. As Cruise says, “I won’t let you down” – and he certainly didn’t."
14,JKQ_Doc4_MissionImpossibleFallout,JKQ,Action,Positive,Mission Impossible Fallout,"While moviegoers enjoyed Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom earlier this summer, the general consensus still appeared to be that the franchise was starting to outstay its welcome. With Mission: Impossible now releasing its sixth instalment, audience fatigue is a very real possibility but director Christopher McQuarrie ensures that's not going to happen by delivering the best action movie of 2018. With fight scenes that beat both The Raid and John Wick and action sequences which are even more thrilling than those seen in the likes of Avengers: Infinity War and Solo: A Star Wars Story, the filmmaker has dreamed up the greatest Mission: Impossible movie to date with Fallout and with a story that's every bit as great as the action, there's no denying that this is an absolute must-see. The franchise's first true sequel, you don't need to have seen the previous movies to keep up with what's going on but it's great seeing Fallout incorporate so many key moments from the past in order to tell a story that's strong both as a standalone piece but even better when those references to what's come before are taken into account. They help make the depth of storytelling here even richer than we could have imagined and Fallout definitely boats the best script of this series to date. Comparisons to The Dark Knight are justified because despite how enjoyable (and often great, especially if we're talking about Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation) the previous five instalments have been, Fallout exceeds expectations in every respect and sets a benchmark not only for this franchise but action movies in general. And make no mistake about it: the action in this movie is insane. Whether we're talking about that incredible fight scene set in a bathroom glimpsed in the trailers, the Halo jump, an intense motorbike chase through Paris, or another crazy Tom Cruise stunt which sees him hanging from a helicopter, this is true edge of your seat stuff and a must-see on an IMAX screen because that not only enhances the visuals but ensures you feel every single gunshot and explosion. In terms of the cast, there are no weak links and Tom Cruise is as reliably excellent as always. He's also very funny in Fallout, showing a slightly different side to Ethan Hunt while still delivering stunts it's hard to believe he's really doing without any help from special effects. However, it's arguably Henry Cavill who steals the show as Agent Walker. While the British actor is obviously best known as Superman to comic book movie fans, he proves that there's a whole lot more to him than that here and without giving anything away, this performance should open the door to some very different roles for Cavill down the line which will be fun to watch. Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, and Rebecca Ferguson also shine, as do every other returning and new cast member. It's a strong ensemble and everyone is given the chance to shine under the watchful eye of McQuarrie. An action movie masterpiece, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is nothing short of incredible and an absolute must-see. It's redefined the genre and this franchise, and the bar has now been set impossibly high for other action movies to try and follow it."
15,JKQ_Doc5_MissionImpossibleFallout,JKQ,Action,Positive,Mission Impossible Fallout,"The Mission: Impossible film franchise is one of the few that somehow got better and better after its third sequel struggle to make a dent at the box office. Not only did the later sequels were financially successful, they’re also critically darlings. Looking at Rottentomatoes.com, Mission: Impossible 4-6 received mid to high 90% rating. After a mission gone wrong and three nuclear missile heads are in the hands of a new group of terrorists known as The Apostles, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his teammates Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames) must retrieve the weapons. When Hunt was getting an intel briefing from his boss Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), as to where he can find the nuclear weapons, they’re both got interrupted by a new CIA director Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett). Sloan is upset that the IMF team lost the nuclear heads and insists that her agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) must go with Ethan to retrieve them. First on their task is to capture and impersonate a man named John Lark (Liang Yang) and meet with a mysterious woman named White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), in Paris who has the connection to the Apostles. But when Hunt and Walker met with White Widow, she insisted that they must break out an international terrorist and Hunt’s nemesis Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) from prison or they won’t get the nuclear weapons. Of course this complicates the mission but both Hunt and Walker went along and helped Lane escaped. Along the way, Hunt ran into an old friend Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). She’s also has her own mission and that is to eliminate Lane for good. Well, things never go as planned and Hunt must use all of his skills to try to save the world from chaos and also save those who he cares about. For the first time in franchise history, the same director and writer Christopher McQuarrie of the previous film has returned and take charge of this new mission. To my surprise, McQuarrie has exceeded what he created in the last picture. He crafted a complexed storyline that’s full of twists, drama, humor and big action sequences. By hiring new crew members, notably a new cinematographer and composer, he was able to differentiate this film from the last one. It’s clearly that he used Nolan’s The Dark Knight as his inspiration for this outing. The film even contains a big chase that’s very similar to a chase sequence from The Dark Knight. A big bathroom brawl, a spectacular motorcycle and car chase through the streets of Paris and a helicopter chase are the highlights of the set pieces. Cinematographer Rob Hardy is having a good year. He shot the excellent Annihilation for Alex Garland earlier this year and again for this film, he did a tremendous job. This film contains so many wide shots in the series since Woo’s Mission: Impossible 2. This is good because we the audience can actually see the action and not trying to figure out what’s going on super chaotic scenes. Shout out also goes to composer Lorne Balfe who apparently is the understudy of Hans Zimmer. So, of course this film’s score sounds like it’s was composed by Zimmer. There’s still the well know Mission: Impossible theme but Balfe made it sounded like something very original. Just a little trivia, Hans Zimmer did compose a Mission: Impossible film, he worked on the second one. With three box office bombs in a row, Cruise poured all of his performance into this film. He did the usual crazy stunts but was willing to show his character’s age and flaws by having him get his ass whooped a few times in the film. The rest of the cast members were pretty good too. I was afraid Ferguson’s Ilsa Faust might just be nothing more than a cameo but her role was an integral part of the story and as usual she saved Hunt’s life couple of times in the film. Simon and Luthor didn’t really have much to do except to be comic relief. Luther did have a touching scene with Ilsa, I really liked that scene. I liked the addition of Alec Balwin’s character and he even got involved in one action scene with the team members. Bassett and Cavill were a nice addition and I hope we see more of Bassett’s character in the next Mission film. Kirby’s White Widow is an interesting character and I thought she played the role quite well even though she didn’t get a lot of screen time. Having seen the film twice already, I can declare Fallout is the best Mission: Impossible film yet. It’s full of humor, great tensions and spectacular actions sequences. If there’s an IMAX, Dolby Cinema or other large vendor theater near you, go see it there. It’s definitely my favorite film of the summer and maybe even of the year."
16,JKQ_Doc6_MissionImpossibleFallout,JKQ,Action,Negative,Mission Impossible Fallout,"Mission: Impossible – Fallout had the best opening weekend of the entire series with $61.2 million (and another $94.6 million overseas). This is the film Tom Cruise broke his ankle on and the film Henry Cavill just had to have a mustache for that made those re-shoots for Justice League have such disastrous results. The sequel has a whopping 97% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and an 86 Metascore on Metacritic. Critics and the general movie-going audience emphatically and enthusiastically adore this film and personally it doesn’t register why the Mission: Impossible franchise is so cherished by movie lovers. Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, Sean Harris as villain Solomon Lane, and Rebecca Ferguson as former MI6 agent Ilsa Faust all return from Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation; this is the first film where a director and a villain have returned from a previous film. The technical aspects of the film are the easiest to admire and the action sequences are outstandingly breathtaking. The big action sequences include the parachute/free fall sequence with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and August Walker (Henry Cavill), the bathroom brawl with Hunt, Walker, and John Lark, Hunt’s motorcycle chase, Hunt running and jumping across rooftops, and the insane helicopter chase. It’s ridiculous (in a good way) how much room cinematographer Rob Hardy (Annihilation, Ex Machina) gives each sequence; these are scenes made for seeing and experiencing in IMAX. You can tell that the majority of the stunts were pulled off practically and green screens and computer generated effects are utilized minimally. The most impressive sequence is the motorcycle chase because Tom Cruise races through the wrong side of traffic without a helmet in the circle around the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. But the helicopter chase features Cruise climbing up a rope dangling in the air while the helicopter is airborne. These sequences are extremely open with perspectives that not only make you feel like you’re with Tom Cruise being just as nuts and exhilarating as he is, but also seem to be making the statement that Cruise is still crazy enough to do the majority of his own stunts at the age of 56 despite his saggy jowls. Many on social media were claiming that Mission: Impossible – Fallout is nonstop action over its nearly 150-minute runtime, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. The film seems to be attempting this never ending adrenaline rush found within the likes of films like Mad Max: Fury Road and Speed, but it fails to do so. The action is superb, but everything in between is extraordinarily dull. Missing the first and third films in the franchise may have contributed to that, but there’s not much to miss here if you haven’t seen the other films in the franchise. Hunt obviously still cares about his ex-wife Julia Meade (Michelle Monaghan), but currently has a connection with Ilsa Faust. The spy element of the sequel feels so cliché and predictable as every twist and big reveal can easily be predicted even if this is your first Mission: Impossible film. The inclusion of a bomb in a Mission: Impossible film feels explosively juvenile at this point and you legitimately have no investment in these characters whatsoever. With every Mission: Impossible film that’s released, it seems like its main purpose is for Tom Cruise to be like Mad TV’s Stuart and yell, “Look what I can do!” before partaking in extracurricular activities a man in his fifties should probably be distancing himself from. To be fair, Cruise is still more than capable of doing incredible action films and is generally a part of films that aim to be exciting for everyone. Fallout is extraordinary if you scrutinize without any sort of context. The film knows how to make your pulse race and your palms sweat as you gasp for breath. But the story is the same as any other Mission: Impossible film and the sequel is basically dead as far as any sort of emotional acting goes. There’s no substance here and impressive action doesn’t make up for a defused storyline."
17,JKQ_Doc7_MissionImpossibleFallout,JKQ,Action,Negative,Mission Impossible Fallout,"The sixth instalment of Mission: Impossible opens with IMF lynchpin Ethan Hunt in the midst of a bad dream. He wakes up with a start. This would be pretty routine stuff but for the fact that the film's protagonist is an unstoppable spy who thrives on performing death-defying stunts without ever worrying about the inherent dangers. The human facet of Tom Cruise's most abiding screen persona separates this action hero from most others. Mission: Impossible - Fallout isn't only about the lead actor jumping of airplanes and skyscrapers, hanging from cliffs, and even flying a helicopter when he doesn't how to. The screenplay gives the star and his co-actors, whether they are playing his foes or friends, substantial character arcs. The title has meaning that goes beyond just this episode - it links Hunt's actions and decisions from earlier Mission: Impossible entries, including his marriage with Julia (Michelle Monaghan), his decision to temporarily quit the Mission Impossible Force, and his battle of wits with the villain of the very first film of the franchise. But thanks to Cruise, the star who has flamboyantly anchored the Mission: Impossible franchise since it kicked off the under the supervision of Brian De Palma in 1996, Fallout works as a film even if one were to ignore what has gone before. The central character wastes no time in swinging into action and plunging into situations that once again test his physical tenacity, courage and luck. The film itself is a breeze, as smooth a ride as any Hollywood action film of recent times. It gallops full throttle but allows occasional breathing spaces that serve the purpose of setting the stage for the big moments. It is not as if Mission: Impossible - Fallout does anything that is remotely off the beaten track. But even as it stays firmly within the parameters of the game as it has been played in the previous five films of the TV series-inspired franchise, it manages to create an air of creative freshness and excitement. Christopher McQuarrie, the only director to return for a second Mission: Impossible film, clearly has a way with action set pieces. The manner in which he spaces out the thrills demonstrates perfect judgment and the way he imparts urgency and pace to these scenes suggest a special flair for blockbuster action interspersed with intriguing reveals and red herrings. Fallout opens a couple of years adrift of the events of McQuarrie's Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation (2015). British secret agent-turned-anarchist Solomon Lane is still in custody since being captured by Hunt. However, the Syndicate formed by the criminal mastermind remains as active as ever. The more intransigent and impatient elements within the outfit have now spun themselves off into a more dangerous group called The Apostles and are plotting the acquisition of nuclear devices powerful enough to flatten the whole world. The Apostles, the audience is told early on through an unusual CNN newscast, plan to target the holiest places of the three Abrahamic religions - the Vatican, Mecca and Jerusalem. For Hunt and his trusted aides, field operative Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and tech-whiz Luther Stickwell (Ving Rhames), it is another race against time to save humanity from annihilation. In Hunt's lexicon, 'humanity' of course pertains as much 'individuals' as to all of mankind. So, he thinks nothing of letting the three plutonium cores slip out of his grasp in an early sequence so as to ensure that one of his mates does not lose his life. This act of generosity is held against him and the CIA chief Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett) deploys her sharpest assassin August Walker (Henry Cavill) to shadow Hunt as he pursues the dangerous Lane and his associates. Sloane taunts the IMF secretary Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin): ""You use the scalpel, I prefer the hammer."" But nothing that Hunt indulges in from here on evokes scalpel strokes. He is into sledgehammer blows, which fit in pretty neatly with the film's sweep and ambition. Besides his ex-wife Julia, a medic he encounters in Turtuk, Leh, Hunt's path cross those of the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), who makes him a deal that he grabs with both hands, and his former ally Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), MI6 agent who is, for mysterious reasons, after the very objects that Hunt is hunting for. Fallout settles into a loopy rhythm that sucks the audience instantly into its orbit. The narrative scampers from one thing to another without running into complications and hindrances that could undermine the visceral hold the film establishes over the viewer. But it is also a rare action film that assumes a somewhat political skew - it talks about destroying the existing world order and starting afresh. From great suffering from come peace, says the arch-villain. Greater the suffering, greater the peace. The methods he proposes to use for achieving that end entails a huge deal of violence. Ethan Hunt, like James Bond but in ways that are diametrically different, is willing to go to any length to see that humanity triumphs. The intertwining of the political and the moral itself makes Fallout an action thriller of a completely unique timbre. The fact that it also delivers a vibrant, globe-straddling plot high points, these constitute the crux, makes it all the more exhilarating. Eminently watchable. This is probably the best Mission: Impossible that there has ever been. That's no exaggeration."
18,JKQ_Doc8_MissionImpossibleFallout,JKQ,Action,Negative,Mission Impossible Fallout,"Look, I hate to be That Guy. I really do. I also hate that I can even be That Guy while still liking a movie, but c’est la vie. The hype for Mission: Impossible – Fallout was modest but the reaction was insurmountable, and the past two weeks have brought a flurry of think pieces that re-examine the franchise. That reaction is warranted, too, what with these films’ shifts over time and the glimmers of Skyfall-esque retrospection in this latest entry. Fallout is serviceable as a whole: a blockbuster with spectacular set pieces to redeem itself from its overlong and tenuously plotted script. It has a ton of marvelous pieces in a package that’s shabbily stitched, but it serves its purpose at the end of the day. It’s the same silver in another pile this time, with writer/director Christopher McQuarrie reprising his roles from 2015’s Rogue Nation. The story this time isn’t too different, but it’s wearing a different mask nonetheless: two years after the IMF team captured Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), the remnants of The Syndicate have reformatted themselves as a new terrorist group known as The Apostles. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) promptly gets a new mission to intercept the sale of three plutonium cores to Apostles members before they’re made into nuclear bombs. The aw-shucks Benji (Simon Pegg) and terminally confident Luther (Ving Rhames) join in, but time CIA Director Erica Sloane (Angela Basset) has assigned operative August Walker (Henry Cavill) to join the mission. Globetrotting adventures ensue, people talk in overly stern matters, everyone is really attractive, our lead character runs a lot—you get the idea. And while that may sound glib, Fallout doesn’t break a ton from the norm—at least in terms of narrative work or character development. Tropes abound and the occasional winking humor is the closest film gets to thorough self-awareness. Whatever extra oomf Fallout could have had is all placed into one single basket. Almost everything else feels like glue to hold the film’s best moments together, and while that’s undeniably disappointing from a macro perspective, that’s more than fine while they’re unfolding. McQuarrie’s attention to framing and sound, especially when matched with Eddie Hamilton’s editing, is bewitching. Steady takes and clear cutting make the action nothing less than immersive, but it’s the sound work that cements the most bombastic scenes as some of the better action sequences in years. The physical proximity to each character and each movement is so minute, so aurally and visually sweeping, that Fallout is often slick as all hell. Cinematographer Rob Hardy (Ex Machina, Annihilation) captures it with a glossiness to juxtapose the audience’s amusement with the characters’ anxieties. So on that level, Mission: Impossible – Fallout is a bona fide success. It’s just too bad that the rest isn’t as refreshing—or even that engaging. McQuarrie’s execution of quieter scenes are comparatively dull as he gets some stiff deliveries from his actors, and the pacing doesn’t help either. The film somehow feels too jumpy to flesh out its story but is 147 minutes nonetheless, and McQuarrie’s script is unsure of how deeply to dive into its politics. The glue holding the action together feels generic and underwhelming as a result: If something surprising happens, it happens too quickly to have a full impact. If you think a character is holding a very specific and very dark secret, they probably are. And rest assured, it’s probably just what you think it is. That being said, Mission: Impossible – Fallout does get points for its treatment of female characters—there’s no fridging to be found—and for its lackluster qualities, Fallout remains consistent in how it treats its characters. It just so happens that these characters aren’t placed into the most intriguing of directions. This is a pretty thin cake with a whole lot of icing, and when the sugar rush wears off between bites, there’s something left to be desired. But dear Lord, is that icing sweet."
19,JKQ_Doc9_MissionImpossibleFallout,JKQ,Action,Negative,Mission Impossible Fallout,"The Mission: Impossible franchise has continued, with the same actor in the lead role, more than three times longer than the seven-year run of the Mission: Impossible TV show. The first film in the series came out the week after I graduated from high school, in 1996. I turned 40 the week I saw the new one. The sixth film, Mission: Impossible—Fallout, stars the 56-year-old Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, the American secret agent who has spent nearly a quarter century engaging in globetrotting intrigue, most of it involving elaborate, impressive stunts. Cruise doesn’t show his age in the slightest, and never seems out of place engaging in fights with men much younger (and taller) than himself, whether they’re hanging from a helicopter, jumping out of a plane or engaging in fisticuffs in a men’s bathroom. While the first five Mission: Impossible films all had different directors, Fallout features a repeater for the first time, with Christopher McQuarrie (who also directed Cruise is the first Jack Reacher movie, the one that was good) returning as writer and director. Fallout feels more like a direct sequel to 2011’s Rogue Nation, directly continuing the plot of that movie and even bringing back one of its main villains, Sean Harris’ Solomon Lane. The plot concerns the efforts of Cruise’s Ethan Hunt and his team (now down to just Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames) to stop the efforts of a mysterious, nihilistic terrorist, who has written an apocalyptic, Steve Bannon-like manifesto about the necessity of massive destruction. Solomon Lane still figures in the plot as a prisoner who’s a pawn among various governments, while Alec Baldwin and Angela Bassett return as rival bureaucrats. The key new edition is Henry Cavill, as an agent at loggerheads with Cruise, and not only does he show more personality than he ever got to as Superman, but we finally see his mustache that was edited out of last year’s Justice League. Also still around is Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), the spy who was the breakout of the 2011 film. Fallout’s one huge strength is that the action is consistently riveting. The film leapfrogs from Belfast to Paris to London to the mountains of Kashmir, and throughout we get about seven different major action set pieces, the best of which is a two-part, multi-faceted chase scene through Paris. Other highlights include a well-executed fight in a bathroom, and the final sequence involving a pair of helicopters. The action is all clear and tightly shot, and if you’re fan of Cruise’s climb up that Dubai skyscraper in the best film of the series, Brad Bird’s 2011 Ghost Protocol, you’re in luck—there are a lot more scenes of Cruise climbing. And, as usual with Cruise, he does a lot of running. The film’s also creative with a few well-worn conceits. Everyone’s tired of action movies, especially the ones involving disasters, using CNN footage to commentate on the action. This one has the best subversion of that ever, including a dynamite cameo by Wolf Blitzer. And while the trope of good guys cutting wires on a bomb while a digital clock counts down how much time is left until it blows up has been in about 500 movies before, Fallout changes it up in a couple of ways, including making one of the clocks analog. However, the film’s weak link is one that it shares with Brian De Palma’s original Mission: Impossible from 1996: the plot is convoluted, with betrayal upon betrayal and plot twist upon plot twist, to the point where it’s difficult for anything to have stakes when they keep changing every 10 minutes. The action is impressive enough to mostly keep this problem at bay, and the third act is relatively straightforward and still pretty thrilling. How long can these movies continue? You have to think the series will eventually go the way of James Bond and put another actor in the Ethan Hunt role, or possibly go back to the premise of the original series and make it about a team. But despite the age of the premise—and its leading man—Mission: Impossible remains the best action franchise going."
20,JKQ_Doc10_MissionImpossibleFallout,JKQ,Action,Negative,Mission Impossible Fallout,"IMF is WTF. Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a franchise, so it's prepackaged. It's patented, not creative. It may be tasty, but it's not fulfilling. The latest episode of the Franchise is all over the place. The Mission Impossible force plays whack-a-mole. It's a game, distended to 2 1/2 hours. It's too much, too often. It tries hard to be generic. It chases after its own tale. Audiences seem to favor that. In many ways Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a paramount example of contemporary film. Stunts overwhelm character. Acting falls far behind motion. Director/writer Christopher McQuarrie is an appropriate representative of the contemporary filmmaker. McQuarrie started out as a clever, imaginative, unique screenwriter. He won an Oscar for writing the enticing The Usual Suspects (1995). Even though he's credited with the screenplay for Mission: Impossible - Fallout, he's essentially not a writer anymore. Mission: Impossible - Fallout is the 4th film McQuarrie has directed. He's controlled by the genre. Words hardly matter. Stunts shove aside language. McQuarrie is now an action director. Much of the publicity centers on the fact that Tom Cruise did many of his own stunts. But Cruise on a motorcycle is not worth 1,000 words. 1,000 words are worth 1,000 words. But in a lot of films today, they're worth nothing. Cruise as Ethan Hunt coasts through Mission: Impossible - Fallout. Cruise flies, flops, and flounders. He doesn't do much acting. He could just as well have been wearing one of the rubber masks the Franchise loves. I've always thought that Tom Cruise is an underrated actor. He has the talent to take more challenges. I hope he will. I think he should. Cruise may deserve a more challenging director than McQuarrie. Most major actors stay with one director for several films. But Cruise hadn't until he made two films with Steven Spielberg (Minority Report, 2002 and War of the Worlds, 2005). Now Cruise has made three films directed by McQuarrie: Jack Reacher (2012), Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation (2015), and Mission: Impossible - Fallout. They challenged his body, but not his soul. Actually McQuarrie did recognize Cruise's soul in Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, which makes it more depressing that he ignores it in Mission: Impossible - Fallout. But there are several directors who have elicited memorable performances from Cruise. Cruise's past directors are a litany of Who's Who among the foremost modern directors. They reached the soul of the actor. It's a stellar list: Barry Levinson (Rain Man, 1988), Michael Mann (Collateral, 2004), Paul Thomas Anderson (Magnolia, 1999), Oliver Stone (Born on the Fourth of July, 1989), Sydney Pollack (The Firm, 1993), Stanley Kubrick (Eyes Wide Shut, 1999), and Marty Scorsese (The Color of Money, 1986). In The Color of Money, Cruise helped Paul Newman win his first and only Oscar. May he join him. The supporting cast backing up Cruise in Mission: Impossible - Fallout is forgettable. Simon Pegg is lively as Benji, and Ving Rhames as Luther has one of the few genuine moments when he explains Hunt to Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson). But usually cardboard figures would suffice. The villains are hairy and nondescript. The women are attractive. The action sequences overwhelm character. The film's flights of fancy are helicopter chases, following rote car chases. Where's John Frankenheimer when we need him? The screenplay offers clichés. Guess how many seconds are left in a countdown when Hunt saves the world? It couldn't be one, could it? The screenplay does offer one telling line. At one point, on the run Hunt yells, ""I'm being followed."" His contact asks, ""CIA or Apostles?"" Hunt responds, ""Does it matter?"" In Mission: Impossible - Fallout, that line says it all."
21,JSB_Doc1_TheMartian,JSB,SCI-FI,positive,The Martian,"Matt Damon becomes The Martian when a severe storm hits the crew of the Ares III on Mars and Mark Watney (Damon) gets left behind, presumed dead. The story of his fight to survive and the triumph of the human spirit in the face of impossible odds is not a new story, but director Ridley Scott tells it like no other.
A New Mission
Having been impaled by part of the communications antenna in the storm, Watney wakes up to find that he’s all alone on the Red Planet. After tending to his wound (I had to look away), Watney assess the situation. He’s got enough food for a little while but rescue won’t come for four years. What’s he going to do? Watney tells his video log, “I’m gonna have to science the **** out of this.”
First on the agenda: food. On a planet where nothing grows, he’s got to figure a way to eat. Of course, he just happens to be a botanist. If he was the mission’s tech guy he would have been toast. He builds a rig that makes water and uses the vacuum packed human waste for fertilizer and, voila, a potato harvest. I laughed out loud at the video log where he pathetically announces that he’s run out of ketchup.
Back on Earth, the NASA satellite operator (Mackenzie Davis) notices stuff moving on Mars. Watney is alive! Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Sean Bean brilliantly play the NASA bigwigs who get to decide what happens next. Ejiofor’s Vincent Kapoor heads the Mars division and Bean’s Mitch Henderson, responsible for the Ares III crew, both want to exhaust all possibilities to get Watney back. Teddy Sanders (Daniels), the boss of NASA, questions the millions of dollars and possible loss of other lives to save just one man. “It’s bigger than one person,” he declares to which Henderson responds, “No. It’s not.”
Next on the agenda for Watney: contact Earth. Salvaging old equipment sent to Mars decades earlier he manages to raise Houston. The fight to bring him home begins.
Matt Damon Rocks
I was expecting something like Castaway when I saw the trailer for The Martian and while there are some elements of the Tom Hanks film, Martian totally blows it out of the water. Matt Damon’s performance makes the 2 hours 21 minutes running time of the film fly by. His ability to capture the gravitas and the humor of the situation has you rooting for him from the very beginning. The supporting cast, including Jessica Chastain as the commander of the Ares III mission, shines. Chastain and crew, together with the folks on the ground at NASA, sustain the suspense of the film and keep the focus on the human story amidst quite a bit of science-heavy dialogue.
Value of One Human Life
The Martian celebrates humanity, human ingenuity, and the drive to survive in the face of dire situations. Watney’s situation is about as dire as they come. With the world watching and helping (the Chinese government declassifies a top secret project to help NASA), the film showcases the best of humanity working together for the sake of one of its own. As I watched, I was reminded of the moral concept of the common good. Working towards the common good challenges people to put selfishness behind in order to build up the good of each other and society.
While The Martian honors the common good and the value of a single human life, I also reflected on the fictional worldwide effort it took to bring Watney home. In reality, our society is inconsistent in applying the same kind of effort to all humans in need. Look at abortion, the homeless, refugees, those who have been neglected by insufficient government programs. Where is the money, the agencies, the tireless effort of people to bring those on the fringes of society “home” to a life where they can live with dignity and respect? It’s there to some extent but, like Pope Francis urges, even more needs to be done.

I hope you will join me in praying for those who harm human dignity by their actions and for those who work diligently for the betterment of each human person made in the image and likeness of God."
22,JSB_Doc2_TheMartian,JSB,SCI-FI,positive,The Martian,"of all the people to get stranded on Mars, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is the lucky one. Smart, resourceful, cunning, and, most importantly, optimistic, Watney can grow potatoes using human feces, manufacture water simply and reconfigure every possible piece of technology available to him. All while maintaining hope in the face of certain catastrophe and sanity in spite of being the only living soul on a planet. Yes, indeed, Mark Watney is one of those rare breeds.
The Martian is a shipwreck story located in the barren wasteland of Mars, set to swinging ’70s disco music and featuring a diverse cast of incredibly smart people doing extraordinarily smart things. The Martian is a sci-fi movie heavy on science but even heavier on the abilities of the human mind to work through any situation presents.
And the science of The Martian seems sound. Or, it is at least presented as such. Thought dead and left on the planet by his crew, Watney must devise a way to create a sustainable food source and contact NASA in hopes of staying alive long enough for a rescue mission to be dispatched. Back in Huston, NASA—headed by Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels)—works with the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena—headed by Bruce Ng (Benedict Wong)—to do the right thing and bring their boy home, regardless of cost, which is astronomical, and man-hours necessary, which is all.
Movies operate primarily with a show don’t tell rule, but The Martian has a lot to tell and manages it with grace and humor. With no one else to talk to, Watney records conversational video diaries of his trials, tribulations, and triumphs on Mars. He lines out his problems, explains how he plans to resolve them, and then reports on their successes or failures. When they succeed, he conveys the perfect amount of American swagger and male triumph—he is genuinely proud and surprised with himself—but when they fail, he is humble and honest. In both cases, Watney’s humor is what keeps The Martian buoyant.
And this buoyancy becomes the most fascinating aspects of The Martian and the most fictitious. Much time is spent with Watney and his acceptance of this situation, which ultimately results in a sublime understanding of existence, but little time is spent with Watney grappling with the issues of imminent mortality and crushing loneliness. Instead, Watney plays the archetypal American go-getter who can think his way out of a problem, or as he puts it, “Science the shit out of this.” This attitude extends far beyond Watney. His crew members—who willingly give up an extra two years of their lives to rescue him—all have families who play second fiddle to the mission, which says nothing of the employees of NASA and JPL, who literally work around the clock for 500+ days and spend an enormous amount of time and money to bring Watney home.
But that’s not what The Martian is about by a long shot. Based on the novel by Andy Weir and adapted by Drew Goddard, The Martian celebrates the brilliant minds and resources across the globe that must come together to conquer mankind’s final frontier. What Watney shows, with a great deal of humor, is that the spirit of the adventurer has not withered and died. They have just been waiting in the wings for their time to come.

If Ridley Scott’s latest foray into the realms of science fiction, The Martian (2015), is to be considered as evidence, then the answer is ‘not likely’. Based on the novel by Andy Wier, here Damon excels as botanist Mark Watney, who is forced to rely on his expert know-how and good old American can-do attitude to survive after been left for dead on the surface of the Red Planet. Fortunately, as the quote in the trailer suggests, he’s perfectly able to “science the shit” out of his predicament and keep audiences thoroughly entertained while doing it. Our protagonist is part of a six person Ares III crew that is just 18 ‘sols'(Mars days) into its mission when a heavy storm forces an emergency evacuation and sends a piece of equipment barrelling into Watney, leaving him dead on in the sand. However, he wakes to find his shipmates departed and the odds impossibly stacked against his survival.

For starters, he’d need to cultivate at least three years of food on a planet where nothing grows. “Luckily I’m a botanist.” Damon delivers that particular knowing quip to camera in what constitutes the film’s most successful and engaging sections. Drew Goddard’s screenplay fizzes with comic dialogue, most notably with Damon looking directly down the lens. It’s a neat conceit that not only facilitates the need for Damon to converse during his isolation, but also taps into themes of ingenuity and resolve. Watney can’t contact NASA and he’s not keeping records for posterity, his dialogue with the audience is his way of staying sane, and he happens to be great company. Every ironic pause and smart aside are judged to perfection, though there may be the odd recurring gag – the one regarding the musical tastes of Commander Lewis (Jessica Chastain) – that outstays its welcome. Even this, though, serves to underscore Watney’s desperation to remain goal-orientated and Damon is exceptional in conveying the precipice on which he’s balancing. Sadly, the whole film can’t just be Damon planting potatoes in the excrement of his crewmates and saying “fuck you, Mars!” The action is divided between Watney, NASA (including Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig and Chiwetel Ejiofor amongst others) and the crew heading home (rounded out by Kate Mara, Sebastien Stan, Michael Peña and Aksell Hennie). While the screenplay remains light-footed, and hardwires the science into proceedings, the material is generally far less compelling and when the drama escalates in the third act, it’s hard not to visualise a working man’s Gravity(2014). Dilemmas both moral and mechanical seem to stretch the runtime rather than serve it and you long for a return to Mars – which itself gets the MVP (Most Valuable Planet) nod thanks to Dariusz Wolski’s fantastic cinematography of its desert-double, Jordan. The stunning scenery and Watney’s contemplation of it, remind of the original reason for the mission, and The Martian is ultimately a love letter to the spirit that saw humanity reach for the stars in the first place. When it’s channelling that spirit via Damon and witty writing it lifts off, but then can’t quite sustain its trajectory. "

It’s almost comical how every problem had a solution that required a specific item that just HAPPENED to already be on Mars. Turns out Watney should just calm down, NASA is the flipping Boy Scouts of government organizations and they have everything covered. Don’t even get me started on how eye-rolling it is to have a ‘real-time’ news broadcast of an event millions of miles away. Even a 3rd grader understands that’s some wonky science right there.

Damon’s Watney spends more time joking and mocking than convincing us he could die at any second. Until the final reel, I had very little attachment to Watney’s plight because he rarely seemed to grasp the absolute severity of the situation. Jovial and charming have their place, but I doubt it’s so prominent when you’re stranded on a barren planet eating veggies grown in your own excrement.
Should we spend billions back on Earth to save one man? Should other astronauts risk their lives in the process? Would this science really work? Could a man actually survive on a distant planet for years with only his wits to save him? These are all of the questions we should be asking, and by the end of “The Martian”, I just didn’t give a damn about any of them.

26,JSB_Doc6_TheMartian,JSB,SCI-FI,negative,The Martian,"Making Do: The Martian How long would you survive on a desert island? Most of us wouldn’t outlast our iPhone batteries. That’s why we love movies where intrepid can-do guys are stranded in harsh conditions and make a go of it with just a pocket knife, a gum wrapper and a frazzled shoelace.
Such a man is Mark Watney (Matt Damon), stranded on Mars after his ship departs, his crewmates thinking him dead. (Not their fault, he’s the first to point out.) , And Mars is even worse than your average desert island, where you can at least breath the air and enjoy a seafood diet.
He’s not wholly without resources. The crew left a base camp equipped with oxygen and food that was supposed to last the five of them a month. But the next ship isn’t headed his way for at least four years.
The Martian could have been called Robinson Crusoe on Mars if that title hadn’t already been taken, back in 1964. That was a pretty good movie, but science has come a long way, so the world is due for an update.
At its best, which is the first half of the movie, The Martian gives us exactly what we’ve come to see: Details of a can-do guy doing. That Watney is a botanist helps when it comes to finding more food. Having a passing knowledge of physics and chemistry also proves useful, as science teachers around the world will be glad to see.
Watney is also an upbeat, optimistic kind of guy, or at least that’s how Damon plays him. You just can’t help but root for him.
You don’t ever stop rooting for him, but the spell of the opening scenes fades away. The novel by Andy Weir from which it was adapted is no one’s idea of great literature, but it’s crammed with details: reading it makes you feel that if you were dropped on Mars with a copy of it, you’d be able to get by. Even better, it makes you feel that any problem can be solved if you just apply some rigorous reasoning to it—if you just, as Watney says, “science the shit out of it
But books are books and movies are movies, and they don’t play by the same rules. The novel was adapted by Drew Goddard, who has given us such logically wobbly films as The Cabin in the Woods and World War Z. Any hope you have that The Martian might be a science fiction version of Cast Away disappears about halfway through when it cops an attitude  of, OK, that’s enough MacGyver stuff, let’s get on to the standard plot about how we’re going to rescue this guy.
I don’t mean to be spoiling anything here, but there are only two ways this movie can go: (1) Watney learns to love a solitary life on Mars, or (2) Watney gets rescued. I would love to see the first movie, but I wasn’t expecting it. And once it becomes clear that this is going the second route—which happens far too early in the proceedings—it stops being interested in Watney’s survival efforts and concentrates on lots of actors playing stressed out NASA guys. Which we’ve all seen before. (Though if you have to have this kind of stuff, it’s fun to see it done by a cast that includes Jeff Daniels (essentially reprising The Newsroom’s Will McAvoy), Chiwetel Ejiofor, Donald Glover, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, and Sean Bean.)
It was directed by Ridley Scott, whose reputation as a thinking man’s science fiction director rests on work that is more than three decades old—Blade Runner, Alien. Once the film moves away from the tight focus on one man’s struggle for survival, it becomes lumpy and erratic, lurching from scene to scene as Scott seems to lose interest in anything but making the spaceships look cool.
I’m probably being too harsh. For a night’s worth of entertainment, it’s pretty decent stuff, especially coming after a summer of brainless comic book movies. But The Martian is its own worst enemy: the good stuff at the beginning makes the run-of-the-mill stuff seem worse than it is."
27,JSB_Doc7_TheMartian,JSB,SCI-FI,negative,The Martian,"Flashback to the films Interstellar and Gravity. Now hold that thought. This latest voyage into outer space places itself firmly between the two. It’s not as sterile as the former and not nearly as OMG entrancing as the latter. The entertainment value is steady, but once the premise is set, the storyline becomes predictable.
The screenplay by Drew Goddard, the ingenious writer of World War Z, is based on an original novel by computer programmer-turned-writer Andy Weir. Goddard’s hard task was to take a book filled with figures, science and math equations and bring it to life. What he has created is a screenplay full of vigor, somewhat conventional, oddly humorous, sometimes emotional and intermittently engaging. Director Ridley Scott adds directorial guidance and slick, professional production elements (think Prometheus). His glossy, overbearing style is balanced by the animated cast, which humanizes the characters.
On Mars, a space crew is carrying out their duties. A windstorm arrives. It becomes more and more intense and violent. They try to make it back to their landing vessel. Flying debris knocks astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) out of sight into a cloud of dust. It’s a tough choice, but Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) decides to hurry her subordinates back onboard, thinking Watney could not have survived the hit. Lewis and her crewmates (Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Aksel Hennie, Sebastian Stan) head back to earth, which is a yearlong journey.
Back on earth, the head of NASA (Jeff Daniels) holds a press conference, announcing Watney’s death. Little does anyone know that Watney survived. As a trained botanist and mechanical engineer, he figures out how to stretch rations, make water and grow potatoes. Everyone is shocked when a satellite’s camera picks up images of Mars, and they notice objects have been moved around. NASA and its California-based Jet Propulsion Laboratory form a think tank with the brightest minds (Chiwetel Ejiofor, Donald Glover) in an effort to communicate with the astronaut and devise a plan to bring him back to earth.
Damon’s warm sense of humor makes the stranded insular Watney affable. Hard not to like his plucky nature. Daniels as the head of NASA is most concerned with branding and his organization’s image in the media. Ejiofor’s earnest performance is a great contrast to Daniels’, as he plays NASA’s Director of Mars missions; a man more interested in the astronaut’s wellbeing. Donald Glover portrays an “orbital dynamicist” at JPL, and is suitably animated as a geek seeking solutions. Chastain, Pena and Mara are all fine within their limited amount of screen time. Saturday Night Live alumna Kristen Wiig, as an oddball media executive, gives an out-of-place performance, like she’s fleshing out a quirky character in an SNL skit in the middle of a dramatic movie.
The music by Harry Gregson-Williams (Shrek), cinematography by Dariusz Wolski (Prometheus), costumes by Janty Yatesav (Gladiator) and production design by Arthur Max (Prometheus) are near perfect at setting atmosphere. This is Ridley Scott’s strong suit as a producer; he always assembles a high-end, unflappable tech crew. But in some cases his grandiose production elements overwhelm the storyline and characters (Body of Lies, American Gangster).
If you see trailers for The Martian, and start to have a déjà vu experience, you are not alone. Matt Damon had an unbilled role in the film Interstellar where he also played a stranded astronaut. Only in that film he wasn’t such a nice guy. Why he decided to play the same kind of character in less than a year is a mystery only he and his agent can answer.
As 141 minutes roll by, the visuals (especially of Mars’s rusty orange/brown landscape), and performances (Damon and Ejiofor have the juiciest roles), help to pique interest and entertain. Yet this film feels like a retread and when you walk out of the theater you may not feel satiated. Something about this whole project feels like it should have been an extended TV series like Lost. It just doesn’t have the gravitas, originality or layers of undercurrent with far-reaching themes that made Gravity and 2001: A Space Odyssey better movies.
A half-hour into the Wizard of Oz, you can predict that Dorothy will make it back to Kansas. A half-hour into The Martian any seasoned moviegoer can figure out where the plotline in this feel-good movie has to go. That’s a shame and the film’s biggest transgression."
28,JSB_Doc8_TheMartian,JSB,SCI-FI,positive,The Martian,"Review: The Martian How do you survive on an uninhabitable planet all by yourself? The subtitle to Ridley Scott’s The Martian could very well be: Science, Hell Yeah!
The film is pro-science in the way that a sports movie about the rag-tag underdog team that wins the big game is pro sports. The film doesn’t just love science, it’s sentimental about its love for science. It wants everyone who watches the film to love science—or more accurately, scientists—as much as it does. And I have to say, the idea that some budding young engineer—perhaps a kid in a NASA T-shirt somewhere in Texas—is going to see this film and get stars in his or her eyes got me a little misty.
Lest you think the film is all brains, no action, please remember that it’s directed by the guy who brought us Gladiator. The film is absolutely thrilling—and it doesn’t waste any time before getting down to business. Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is on a mission to explore Mars, along with his fellow crewmembers and his commander, Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain). A deadly storm takes a sudden turn and touches down and, as the crew scrambles to get back on the ship, Watney is struck by a piece of hurling debris. The blow is bad enough that it likely killed him—and with the ferocious wind and flying red dust, Lewis can’t see anything. She has two choices: Risk her entire crew by searching for a man who is probably already dead or leave without him. Reluctantly, she decides to leave. But, of course, Watney is not dead. He wakes up with a punctured space suit and no space ship, alone—on Mars.
There is, however, a space station, filled with about a year’s worth of food and cubbies containing a few minor personal effects for each of the astronauts (including Lewis’s mixed CDs of 70s disco, one of the film’s few overly-played-out jokes). But Watney knows that it might take months for NASA to figure out he’s alive and then as many as four years before they could possibly come back to retrieve him. A space botanist, he’s going to have to create his own food supply—seemingly impossible on a planet where nothing grows and there’s no water.* Watney, who has been videotaping his time alone on Mars for both an accurate record of his survival and to keep himself from going mad, turns to the camera: “I’m going to have to science the shit out of this,” he says.
That’s the best line in the film, and it also perfectly captures the film’s ethos. Because it’s not just Watney who needs to science the shit out of things. Back at NASA, once they figure out that Watney is alive (a satellite camera trained to the planet picked up on his movements), an accelerated rescue mission needs to be coordinated. Basically, things that normally take years to do now must be done in months, even weeks. And then the question emerges: Should they tell the surviving members of the crew, who are still months away from returning to earth, that Watney is alive?
One of the many things I like about The Martian: There are no bad guys. In most films of this type, there’d be some whispered resistance to bringing Watney home. After all, they’d already held a beautiful public memorial service for him, why not just leave him up there? But this is not that kind of film. Everyone wants to get Watney back and for the right reasons; they simply have slightly different agendas. Jeff Daniels, playing the director of NASA, wants to do what’s best for the agency going forward. Kristen Wiig, playing NASA’s director of PR, wants to put the best public spin on things. Sean Bean, as a kind of liaison to the astronauts, wants to keep Watney’s fellow crewmembers apprised of all the developments. And Chewetel Ejiofor, as the director of Mars operations, is bound by both his duty to NASA and his duty to the crew.
There’s more fun science: The always-welcome Donald Glover plays a young astrophysicist—a kind of rumpled, distracted, genius type—who devises a plan to rescue Watney, that’s either totally brilliant or totally insane. (Of course I’m not going to tell you which.)
Better still: The astronauts and physicists are a wonderfully, casually diverse bunch. Glover and Ejiofor are black. Michael Pena, who’s Hispanic, plays one member of Watney’s original crew. The lead rocket scientist (Benedict Wong) is a Chinese-American, and the Chinese space program is instrumental in assisting Watney’s rescue mission. The ship’s commander is a woman, as is one more crew member (Kate Mara), plus a digital expert back at home (Mackenzie Davis).
Screenwriter Drew Goddard, working off Andy Weir’s beloved novel, does a great job of keeping us engaged with what happens on the ground, but we spend most of our time alone, with Watney. At one point, in a sort of awed voice, Watney notes that everything he does on Mars is a first: First to walk here. First to see this. First to grow something there.
Even once he manages to grow potatoes in a kind of makeshift greenhouse, his odds are survival are slim, and he knows this. But he just solves one problem at a time. That’s all he can do. Damon is great in this part, relying on his natural charisma and lightening-quick smarts to keep us engaged with Watneys every thought,his every mood swing. A few critics have objected to Watney’s impish sense of humor throughout his ordeal—it certainly makes the science-y parts more fun—but I bought it. If you’re a funny person, you’re funny in a crisis. Also, Watney’s sense of humor is probably what kept him alive.
I’m the least mechanically inclined person alive, so I have no idea if the science in The Martian is accurate. It sure felt accurate, which is all that matters in a way. On top of being wildly entertaining, the film is about using your wits to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. In a country that often values feats of strength more than feats of intelligence, that’s something to cheer about, indeed. *Okay, so it turns out there’s water."
29,JSB_Doc9_TheMartian,JSB,SCI-FI,negative,The Martian,"In The Martian, Matt Damon plays a cosmonaut as emotionally barren as the ochre planet on which he’s stranded. Ridley Scott’s latest film is a robotic exaltation of science, problem-solving and ingenuity; if you can tolerate the gaping logical perforations on its admittedly rambunctious surface, you’ll still have to wade through a sea of Cold War-era pro-American sentiment to see the human drama, which is relegated to the sub-subtext. Indeed, rather than grapple with the solitude of their protagonist, Scott and screenwriter Drew Goddard use science to build a protective armour around him, shielding the spaceman from his own loneliness and the now-quaint idea of human vulnerability.1 Instead we’re served volleys of irrepressible optimism and resourcefulness, all unchipped by the physical and emotional tolls that accompany the nine-hundred days spent alone on a planet in which human life is completely untenable. This pre-Freudian man has no repressible attributes — he’s a perky ego in a spacesuit. When it comes time for the inevitable ‘triumph-of-the-human-spirit’ that necessitates his regurgitated survival narrative, all that computes is smugness and nationalism. The human spirit can’t triumph if it’s anethetised by entirely synthetic concepts.
Damon plays NASA botanist Mark Watney, abandoned eighteen days into a Mars reconnaissance mission after a brutal dust storm sweeps him astray of his crew, who hurry back to Earth under the assumption that Watney is dead. Dazed, but stable enough to set up fort in the pod-like lodgings left behind, Watney is struck by an ingenious but unlikely plan for survival — one of a dozen lightbulb moments that act as jet fuel for The Martian’s narrative. He doesn’t think or strategise, the ideas simply come to him, and he espouses them in frivolous bits of diaristic exposition spoken directly to camera. Meanwhile on Earth, NASA boss Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) and his team (Kristen Wiig, Chiwitel Ejiofor, Donald Glover — a rather distracting conglomeration of actors known for severely divergent genres) decide not to inform the still space-bourne crew that Watney is alive on the red planet, leaving them lingering in ignorance. Aboard that ship, stranded in narrative purgatory, are Jessica Chastain, Kate Mara, Michael Pena and a few other minor players, unquestioningly flat creations who work at NASA’s service with unwavering glee. Nine-hundred days fly by as Scott flings us between these three sets — Earthlings, the Martian and the crew in-between.
It’s disappointing to see Ridley Scott — who launched his formidable career by looking upward to the cosmos and turning its inky-black reaches into a miasma of dread and isolation in 1979’s Alien — so disinterested in the wider universe’s fictive possibilities. After the bungled (but at least ambitious) space-nonsense of Prometheus and the cataclysmically scrambled spectacle of last year’s Exodus: Gods and Kings, Scott plays a safe hand with this mythology-free (science only!) survivor story based on Andy Weir’s self-published book of the same name, and adapted for the screen by Goddard. It’s the latter’s script that dictates The Martian’s perky mood and bro-talk shtick, which are borrowed straight from the Marvel Studios playbook.2 Here, outside of the Marvel wheelhouse, its arbitrariness has never felt more glaringly obvious. The most memorable one liners — “I’m gonna have to science the shit out of this!”, “Fuck Mars!” — hinge upon your susceptibility for laughing at swear words. This sensibility is aided by the bouncy soundtrack, filled with disco-era gems from Vicki Sue Robinson, The O’Jays and Abba, and sutured into the narrative in a conceit imitative of the mix tape in James Gunn’s Guardians of the Galaxy. The forced-upon disco sends Watney, who listens begrudgingly, up the wall, but we’re obviously encouraged to enjoy it like one would a ‘guilty pleasure’. The discord between actual pleasure and ironic condescension feels awkward and anachronistic — what is this, 1983? And the ideology matches the music. Emotional frailty and imagination are expunged from Scott’s distinctly American ideal vision of the future, as though it’s in the country’s best interests that these imperceivably happy characters be constantly working with a sense of near-communist wartime glee, their personal and emotional lives censored from the film’s purview. The Cold War symbolism of NASA as a boastful source of nationhood is reinflated, with Damon shouldering the role of the brave explorer. “I colonised Mars”, says Watney, “in your face Neil Armstrong!” It’s a sentiment that’s easy to buy but — like much palatable American commercialism is want to do — it stains your teeth. The Martian humours the idea that the astronaut is the ideal form on a hierarchy of human life, so brave and noble that billions can be spent to salvage his life without once questioning the inherent aristocracy that this act entails.
That The Martian is postured to become a substantial hit says more about the changing predilections of the market than it does about the merits of the work itself; Scott plays into the hands of a culture dominated by washed, likeable heroes that lack emotional substance, a culture increasingly reliant on spectacle, humour, watertight sci-fi mythology and fleshed out ‘cinematic universes’. Damon’s effortless ingenuity and sanguine charm make his Mark Watney a fashionable protagonist, swaggering into sequence alongside a murderer’s row of cheesy cutouts that precede him: Ant Man, Iron Man and Star Lord amongst them. I couldn’t help but wonder, over and over, whether his bowels could withstand the inane diet of micro-farmed potatoes forced upon them, whether he could cry, or whether he ever once felt lonely or depressed.
For distraction from such pressing matters, The Martian relies on a style that zips along with an effervescent tang, careening through space with the grace of zero-gravity (Jessica Chastain does some lovely floating a la Tree of Life, by the way) and high-spirited jocularity. There are scenes which border on thrilling, like its rescue mission climax evocative of Gravity’s swirling, breathtaking opening. But, unlike Sandra Bullock’s complex Ryan Stone, these players lack the fundamental depth to inspire outstretches of empathy — the set pieces are momentarily gripping by virtue of their scale, but the human stakes glow about as dimly as a dead planet’s core. These details might appear secondary to a film this judiciously obsessed with mythbusting its own survival hypothesis, but to audiences back on Earth, where pathos enriches drama and spectacle, and where cinema should do more than just nicely accompany your popcorn, they remain a priority."
30,JSB_Doc10_TheMartian,JSB,SCI-FI,negative,The Martian,"The riposte, and it's a fair one, is: What would make you happy? And the frustrating response is, ""I don't know."" The problem is this (and in a movie about solving problems, it's germane to raise one): that The Martian, Ridley Scott and Drew Goddard's faithful adaptation of Andy Weir's bestseller, is essentially a bwana story in which smart and resourceful black and Chinese people band together to save a white explorer who declares himself both ""colonizer"" and ""pirate"" at various points in the movie. It's a summary of a certain kind of film, too, the space opera that used to be all the rage in the 1950s--a decade actually interested in exploration rather than defunding NASA and rabid anti-intellectualism. The only thing missing is a space chimp and a space lady with rockets in her brassiere. I confess that I probably wouldn't have even been thinking much, or perhaps as quickly, about the racial politics of this film had Matt Damon, the bwana in question, not ""whitesplained"" to a black producer (a female black producer) what diversity means as regards his wish-fulfillment reality series ""Project Greenlight"". Or if it weren't directed by Ridley Scott, whose last film, Exodus: Gods and Kings, required volumes of whitesplaining itself as to why the principals of his Middle Eastern/African tale were white.

So what would have made me happy? If an Asian (there must be one of the 2 billion of us on the planet up to the task) were cast as über-starman Mark Watley instead of Damon? I don't know--because, you know, casting an Asian as someone as resourceful and good at math as Mark is could be seen as something of a stereotype in itself--though of course the head of JPL on Earth is a portly Chinese guy who doesn't get a credit on IMDb, naturally, although he's a major player. What if Mark were a black guy--Idris Alba, perhaps. Of course he's too street for Bond, so he'd be way too street for an astronaut. Maybe Don Cheadle. Or Terrence Howard, who gets a whole article on how he's a crazy person while Mark Wahlberg gets a lifetime pass for beating an Asian guy for being Asian. What about a woman? I guess it doesn't really matter because, for the most part, The Martian doesn't really care. I don't mean doesn't care in a Gene Roddenberry sense, but doesn't care as in there isn't character development in all of the 140+ minutes of The Martian so much as there's a description of types and then a collection of pretty scenes and expert vistas. The only reason I'm raising this racial question at all is because The Martian doesn't do anything to replace that conversation with a different one. I guess what would have made me happy is a movie that's about something other than pluck.

As in the book, a manned mission to Mars aborts suddenly, stranding Mark, thought dead. But he's not dead. This makes for an embarrassing public relations thing for NASA head Teddy (Jeff Daniels, who, between this and Steve Jobs, has reached terminal let's-have-a-friendship-break velocity), his PR officer (Kirsten Wiig, tragically wasted), and head of something-something Boromir (Sean Bean), who lands the single best joke in the entire thing--a joke so meta, so brilliant, that it almost saves the entire movie by itself. The film then flits back and forth between Mark trying to stay alive on Mars with limited resources and NASA--and eventually CNSA--trying to rescue him with unlimited resources. See, it's science-fiction. It's a weird sort of fantasy, too, in that it posits an Earth, a United States, that actually cares about exploration for its own sake enough to fund it. The Martian joins Interstellar in that way as hopeful shots across the Conservative bow. Its hero is a botanist of all things who figures out how to cultivate Martian soil to extend his life on the planet for a couple hundred crucial days as the mostly black and Chinese scientists back on Earth figure out a way to rescue him. Fair? I don't know. I do wish that The Martian had given me something else to discuss beyond how this is a slightly more multi-cultural Cast Away--or, you know, a Robinson Crusoe on Mars where you also get to see the work put into rescuing the hero from the other side. It would've been better with a monkey, though.

Bloated, dry as a soda cracker, and 100% safe for awards-season consumption, The Martian can be allied with those old Merchant/Ivory productions as well. It's a period piece, a costume drama; the lead is witty and of marriageable age, and we presume he comes from a good family, though the film can find no time for this despite its distended length. Plus, like those musty old Merchant/Ivorys, it's utterly professional and appears right around the time that old folks' thoughts turn towards Oscar telling them what they should watch. Even most of the ""fucks"" are redacted to preserve delicate sensibilities. I'm not kidding. It's the easy-to- masticate and digest version of Philip Kaufman's The Right Stuff in almost exactly the same way that Spotlight is the fallen-and-can't-get-up version of All the President's Men: elderly films of a stately demeanour targeted--laser-sighted, in fact--to a very specific demographic that wants their action tame, their sex not to be spoken of, their heroes white as a sheet, and the hero's helpers all the colours of the multicultural rainbow. What does it say that The Martian makes Apollo 13 seem lively? It didn't used to be like this. There was a time when major movie studios were producing things like Apocalypse Now that had, still has, zero fucks to give about whether you like it or not. The Martian is ingratiating like Eddie Haskell. It's a bushel of corn, boiled just so with a little butter and salt on a warm Iowa day. You should read Ray Bradbury's ""Mars is Heaven,"" just for a quick reminder of what fairytales of succour inevitably turn out to be."
31,AKL_Doc1_Interstellar,AKL,Sci-Fi,Positive,Interstellar,"At the beginning of Interstellar, Christopher Nolan’s ambitious-and-then-some new science-fiction movie, the lights have started to dim on Earth. Some unspecified cataclysm related to a devastating world war has thinned the populace and thrown the globe out of balance, introducing a new, worldwide dust bowl and a blight that’s driving plant life to extinction. Wheat is gone. Okra is on its way out. Soon all that will be left is corn. Yet life goes on for those who’ve held on, albeit at a slower pace, and with a new focus on farming. A widowed father of two, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) trained his whole life to travel beyond the clouds as a NASA pilot, but a devastating crash and the new agrarian order have left him earthbound as he and his father-in-law (John Lithgow) raise his son Tom (played as a teenager by Timothée Chalamet), who’s content to move on to a life on the farm, and 10-year-old daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy), who isn’t. Like her father, she has an eye trained on the sky and what might be found there. She even gets suspended for bringing an old textbook to school that contains the story of the moon landing, instead of the new, official version of how the U.S. faked the Apollo missions to bankrupt the Soviet Union. Like her father, she belongs to a more adventurous past, or a brighter future. The present isn’t made for them.
That’s also true of Interstellar, a film as stylistically bold and in love with cutting-edge special effects as it is old-fashioned. Nolan’s script, co-written with his brother and longtime writing partner Jonathan, often plays like an attempt to bring science fiction back to first principles: What’s out there? What does the future hold? How will it reshape us? And what lies not just on the horizon, but beyond it, in the places we not only can’t see, but can’t even imagine? The Nolans fill the film with references to Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke’s 2001: A Space Odyssey: episodic structure, echoes of its soundtrack in Hans Zimmer’s stirring score, images of mighty spacecraft looking fragile and tiny when placed in front of mighty galactic bodies in the silence expanses of space, a final blurring of science and mysticism. Yet James Cameron’s 1989 film The Abyss seems just as likely a model. Like that movie, Interstellar attempts to balance hard science and a soft heart. And, also as with The Abyss, the balance often eludes it.
Murph complains her bedroom is troubled by ghosts, but Cooper is too much a man of science to entertain that kind of suggestion. Together, they look for an explanation as to why the books sometimes fall off her shelf for no apparent reason, and why the dust settles in clear patterns. Determining that they’ve been given geographical coordinates by forces unknown, they set off to see what’s there, never expecting to stumble upon what remains of Cooper’s old NASA employers, including Professor Brand (Michael Caine), a genius physicist he worked with in the old days, and Brand’s daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway), now Brand’s equally determined assistant. Sensing Cooper and Murph mean them no harm, and can ultimately help them, the Brands bring them into a well-kept secret: NASA has spent years working in secret on a way to rescue the human population from an Earth they know is doomed. They’ve even sent some brave explorers through a wormhole to find habitable planets, and they feel optimistic about the results. They just need a crew, and a capable pilot like Cooper to check on what they’ve found, even if this means not returning to Earth for years—if ever.
What happens next is best discovered on Interstellar’s terms, though those who have seen the film will have a lot of questions and should head to The Reveal to discuss them. In short: It’s a lot, as if the Nolans felt compelled to pack the film with every science-fiction device and concept they ever wanted to explore, from a witty robot (named TARS, and voiced by Bill Irwin) to the mind-bending implications of relativity to philosophizing about human nature. The generous running time gives Interstellar ample space to explore whatever it likes, but the film doesn’t always use that space well. Concepts get explained and re-explained, and characters get established, then established again, through here’s-what-this-guy’s-all-about dialogue that’s a couple of rewrites away from sounding natural. It’s as if the Nolans heard some of the complaints directed at Inception and decided to double down: Interstellar often seems afraid to let any development go unpacked and uncommented upon, except for a handful of points that dive into the action and expect viewers to catch up.
The film is at its best in these moments, when it’s unafraid of challenging storytelling, particularly since Interstellar never has trouble finding visuals to match its heady concepts. The Nolans’ latest feels more comfortable when it heads to the rings of Saturn, settles into the alien landscapes of faraway worlds, and plunges into the cosmic unknown than it ever does when pausing to lay out what it will take to move from Point A to Point B. Late in the story, Interstellar abandons all timidity, and as the score starts striking ominous notes and the action mounts on three separate planes at once, it becomes a fleeter, more Christopher Nolan-like film than it had previously dared. That makes it easy to wish for the more daring, propulsive film that might have been.
The movie we got is still remarkable. Nolan fills the screen with extraordinary images, on Earth and in the heavens, and McConaughey gives it a much-needed center of gravity. Ultimately, Interstellar owes as much to Homer’s Odyssey as the one Kubrick directed: McConaughey plays Cooper as a hero driven by a need to explore, yet yearning to return home to those who need and love him. The later sequences movingly portray how much distance he’s traveled and the damage his absence has exacted on those he’s left behind, both by traversing that distance and by lingering on McConaughey’s face as he takes stock of where life has taken him. He delivers a deeply affecting performance, one he couldn’t have pulled off if he were afraid to make himself look vulnerable. He does eloquent work in the midst of a beautiful, admirably overreaching, often ineloquent movie. His performance nails what the film around it can never quite express as well as it wants: that however far we might go in the cosmos, our humanity, with all its lovely, tragic, defining needs and weaknesses, will always travel with us."
32,AKL_Doc2_Interstellar,AKL,Sci-Fi,Positive,Interstellar,"The end of the world is nigh. That’s the gloomy message that has been offered by Hollywood’s science-fiction blockbusters recently – and it’s getting gloomier all the time. For years, we had films depicting the ragged remnants of the human race traipsing around a post-apocalyptic desert: The Road, I Am Legend, The Book Of Eli and many more. And then, last year, we had Elysium, Oblivion and After Earth, three separate films that suggested we’d have to abandon the ruined earth altogether and set up camp on a space station or distant planet. Now we have Interstellar, a spectacular and cerebral take on the same scenario, co-written and directed by Christopher Nolan, the filmmaker behind The Dark Knight and Inception.
It stars Matthew McConaughey as Coop, a widowed farmer and father of two. He lives in a near-future where regular dust storms leave every surface coated in sand and where a mystery ‘blight’ is wiping out the world’s crops one by one. It’s a future which is much more chilling than the standard sci-fi wasteland, simply because it is much more recognisable: society is still functioning, most of the technology is familiar, but humanity doesn’t have many years left.
Coop is no ordinary farmer, however. He used to be a NASA test pilot, but now that governments have to commit all their resources to feeding the populace, none of them can afford to fund a space programme. That’s what Coop thinks, anyway. In fact, after a fair amount of front-porch brooding and arguing with his father-in-law (John Lithgow), he discovers that NASA has been continuing its research in secret. What’s more, it has spotted a wormhole near Saturn which may serve as a gateway to another galaxy. NASA’s top boffin (Michael Caine) believes that a habitable planet can be located there, and he wants Coop to pilot the next wormhole-bound probe. The mission would force him to leave behind his beloved son and daughter – perhaps forever, and definitely for several years. But Coop is driven both by his wish to save humanity, and by his urge to climb off a tractor seat and back into a cockpit, so he agrees to blast off into space with the boffin’s testy daughter (Anne Hathaway), two other human co-pilots and two slab-shaped, sardonic robots.
It wouldn’t be right to reveal where these intergalactic explorers go or what they find, but it is fair to say that, once again, Nolan has taken a pulp genre film and given it a scope and seriousness that sets it apart from the competition. Just as his Batman trilogy was far more philosophical and knottily plotted than the average superhero movie, Interstellar is sufficiently grand and challenging to bear comparison with those two touchstones of mind-bending epic sci-fi: Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey and Tarkovsky’s Solaris.
What’s even more impressive is that Nolan doesn’t employ many more digital effects than those films did. There are certainly a few dizzying computer-generated visuals, but for the most part he relies on physical props and sets, and judicious location shooting (Iceland doubles for two alien planets). This choice lends Interstellar a sense of reality and bone-jarring danger that you don’t get from the shiny, video-game CGI in the most recent Star Trek movies. Just as important, Hans Zimmer’s music makes the film seem even more colossal than it would otherwise: Zimmer invokes the original meaning of ‘pulls out all the stops’, rattling our teeth with reverberating pipe-organ chords. And the acting is as full-blooded as anything you’d find in an earthbound drama. McConaughey, fresh from his Oscar win for Dallas Buyers Club, is particularly affecting. In one scene, his face is flayed by shock, grief and joy, and I found myself wondering which of his peers would have been capable of such raw intensity. Tom Cruise? Leonardo DiCaprio? Brad Pitt? None of the above.
Magnificent as Interstellar is for much of its running time, though, some viewers will leave the cinema feeling that it might just have been a daft sci-fi yarn, after all. Much of that feeling will stem from the dramatic climax, which is swamped by a mushiness that was kept in check in Inception, let alone the Batman films. McConaughey is shatteringly good during this key sequence, but it’s so contrived and sentimental that it wouldn’t get past the script editors on Doctor Who.
And there are other, earlier signs that Interstellar isn’t quite as boldly intellectual as 2001 or Solaris. There’s the clichéd moment at NASA when someone comments that Coop was “the best pilot we ever had” – so why didn’t they contact him sooner? There are the scenes, halfway through the mission, when the spacecraft’s crew members sit around explaining to each other what a wormhole looks like and arguing about which planet to visit next – shouldn’t they have sorted that out before they left earth? And, most jarring of all, there’s Hathaway’s hippy speech about how love transcends all physical boundaries. None of these moments is terrible (well, maybe Hathaway’s speech is), but they don’t belong in a film that ponders quantum mechanics as brainily as Interstellar does.
Essentially, Nolan ignores the ‘show don’t tell’ rule of fiction: he doesn’t let a theme or a concept go by without spelling it out to the audience. It’s possible that he felt he had to dumb down some of the dialogue (which he co-wrote with his brother Jonathan) to compensate for the complicated stuff about the space-time continuum. It’s possible, too, that at heart he just wanted to make a sweet, old-fashioned fable about a father’s love for his children. It seems as if was aiming to travel somewhere far more ambitious than mainstream Hollywood filmmaking – but, unlike Coop and co, he couldn’t quite get through the wormhole."
33,AKL_Doc3_Interstellar,AKL,Sci-Fi,Positive,Interstellar,"Ah, for simpler times back in the spring, when True Detective was on the air and Matthew McConaughey’s Rust Cohle was explaining to us that time is “a flat circle.” McConaughey has now returned for director Christopher Nolan’s sci-fi opus Interstellar, and over the intervening months, the concept of time has only become more perplexing—one dimension out of at least five that make an appearance in the movie. Indeed, a modicum of perplexity may be the price of admission: Though Interstellar is quick to cite Einstein’s theories of relativity—celebrated theoretical physicist Kip Thorne acted as a consultant and executive producer—it rarely slows down to explain how they apply.
In any case, Interstellar is quite adamant—and here I’m certain the movie is not channeling Einstein—that however many dimensions may exist, love trumps them all. Love, we are instructed variously, is “quantifiable,” “must have a purpose,” and “is the one thing that transcends time and space.”
If this sounds like a hokey premise for a story about Earthly apocalypse and intergalactic exodus, that’s because it is one. But this is hokiness of uncommon scale and grandeur. Interstellar may be a preposterous epic, but it is an epic nonetheless. For years, the project was attached to Steven Spielberg, and these roots are very much in evidence. Envision a movie as Spielberg-y as any you’ve ever seen—all the craftsmanship, all the sentimentality—add in a concluding twist reminiscent of M. Night Shyamalan (not the current version, but the circa-Signs, not-yet-tragic version), and you’ll have a pretty good sense of what to expect.
The movie opens with a series of elderly commentators recollecting their youth in a rural America smothered by dust: dust covering bookshelves, dust choking crops, dust accumulating so insistently that you had to put the plates facedown when setting the table. Steinbeck’s Dustbowl? No, a stray laptop soon alerts us that this is a Dustbowl yet to come. The exact cause of the environmental catastrophe is never clarified, though it is clearly something we brought upon ourselves. The threat, moreover, is existential: The Earth is slowly suffocating itself. The last wheat harvests are long gone, and the last okra harvest is around the corner—though, according to taste, one might consider this a feature rather than a bug. Corn remains, but how long can it sprout from land so doomed?
Among the farmers tilling this egregious soil is a former NASA pilot named Cooper (McConaughey), single father to a down-to-Earth son and a head-in-the-clouds daughter. The latter, Murph (named after Murphy’s Law, and played in her youth by Mackenzie Foy), believes that a poltergeist is haunting the overstuffed bookshelf in her bedroom and, in her mystico-scientific way, sets out to prove it. She also gets in trouble for bringing an old textbook to school, one that has not been “corrected” to explain that the 20th-century Apollo missions were merely a hoax to bankrupt the Soviets. Burned once by science, the nation as a whole has turned inward, backward.
But not so Cooper. “We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars,” he lectures his father-in-law (played with curmudgeonly nonchalance by John Lithgow). “Now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt.” Fortunately for Cooper, he is not alone in this view. The NASA for which he once flew, long believed shuttered, has in fact gone underground as exactly the kind of covert government outfit that Fox Mulder was always looking for. Moreover, it just happens to be in need of a top-notch pilot to complete its ongoing secret mission of extraterrestrial exploration and colonization.
As luck would have it, the fellow running the show turns out to be an old teacher of Cooper’s, Professor Brand (Michael Caine), who explains that decades earlier an intergalactic wormhole was created near Saturn by mysterious five-dimensional beings who evidently wanted to help humankind find a new home. Initial manned probes were sent to several planets on the far side, and the plan is for Cooper to fly a larger ship called the Endurance—a ring-shaped vessel reminiscent of the space station in 2001: A Space Odyssey—through the wormhole to determine which of those worlds might prove fittest for human habitation.
Accompanying him will be three other human crewmembers, one of whom is Professor Brand’s daughter (Anne Hathaway) and two of whom are not (David Gyasi and Wes Bentley). Also along for the ride will be two robots that seem to have wandered in from another movie altogether: wisecracking aluminum boxes that amble like Gumby and gleam like high-end kitchenware. Cooper of course accepts the mission—“This world was never enough for you, Coop,” his father-in-law grouses—even though it pains him cruelly to leave his kids, especially the heartbroken Murph, who refuses to see him off.
I won’t say much about what unfolds once they’re aloft. But the novel obstacle that Cooper and his fellows must overcome, as I hinted earlier, is time itself. It’s not merely that the clock is running out for life on Earth, it’s that due to a property called gravitational time dilation (predicted by Einstein and since confirmed experimentally), the clock is running far more quickly back home than it is for the astronauts. When the latter land on a planet orbiting a black hole, for instance, a single precious hour on the surface is equal to seven years’ time on Earth. Before leaving his daughter, Cooper had joked that when they met again they might be the same age—and, indeed, soon enough they are, with Jessica Chastain inheriting the role of the grownup Murph.
McConaughey is entirely solid as the conflicted dad-turned-space-jockey, and Caine could pull off the avuncular authority of the elder Dr. Brand in his sleep. Hathaway, however, is an awkward fit as Dr. Brand fille, too loose at times and too tight at others. She’s certainly not helped by plot developments that quickly render her the Girl Who Needs Rescuing and, later, have her argue for making decisions about the survival of the human race based on whom she wants to canoodle with. Yes, the movie itself may ultimately come to the conclusion that love conquers all, but making Hathaway an early advocate for this thesis does not exactly bolster her scientific credentials.
There is much agonized familial melodrama on display throughout: a father (McConaughey) who’s left his daughter behind on Earth; a daughter (Hathaway) who’s done the same with her dad. Difficult choices are made with regularity, and there is much discussion of our obligations to our children, to ourselves, and to humankind as a whole. Lest there be any doubt of how seriously the film treats these questions, they are often accompanied by deafening swells of the Hans Zimmer score and repeated invocations—I counted at least four—of the Dylan Thomas poem “Do not go gentle into that good night.” (It’s less tedious if you close your eyes and imagine that it’s Rodney Dangerfield doing the reciting.)
This solemnity of tone coexists uncomfortably with a number of plot twists that defy any but the most generous credulity. To cite just one, it turns out that the answers to the riddle that might save humanity (the “solution” to gravity) are to be found both in the childhood bedroom in which Murph once detected a poltergeist and in the core of a black hole galaxies away, two unlikely locales that are in fact—well, I’ll let you see for yourself.
Because despite its shortcomings, Interstellar is a movie worth seeing. Yes, it may be tendentious at times and absurd at others. But the scope and ambition of Nolan’s vision are refreshing in this era of safe bets, of sequels and spinoffs and franchise-hopefuls. The visuals alone are worth it: the violent whirling of a dust-hurricane on Earth; the crash of a mile-high tidal wave on a distant world; the quiet, deep-space beauty of a black hole ringed by a glowing accretion disc. In ways both good and (occasionally) bad, Interstellar is a mind-blowing movie. Enjoy it accordingly."
34,AKL_Doc4_Interstellar,AKL,Sci-Fi,Positive,Interstellar,"The title of Christopher Nolan’s behemoth space epic says it all – a grandiloquent declaration of scale that smacks simultaneously of ambition and hubris – like Titanic, both the ship and the film. The good news is that this flawed but frequently awe-inspiring movie about wormholes and black holes does not implode into a dark star of disappointment; if it’s spectacle you want, then Interstellar delivers, particularly when viewed in Nolan’s preferred 70mm Imax format.
Yet while the film’s massive gravitational pull guarantees astronomical box-office returns, fans of Nolan’s finest works (Memento, The Prestige, Batman Begins, Inception) will long for more narrative rigour as raw science, rich sentimentality and rank silliness battle for the heart and soul of this very personal project. As a diehard Nolanoid, I found myself largely enthralled, often amazed and occasionally aghast.
Seamlessly amalgamating his own semi-formed stories about space travel with a script that his brother Jonathan (“Jonah”) had been developing for Steven Spielberg, Nolan’s long-gestating magnum opus is a futuristic fable firmly rooted in the age-old traditions of sci-fi. We open in a dust-bowl dystopian future where blighted food supplies are dwindling and inhabitable Earth is dying. Harking back to Edwin Balmer and Philip Wylie’s 1933 novel When Worlds Collide (a Depression-era text brought to the screen by producer George Pal in the 1950s), Nasa builds a “space ark” – a giant ship that will take mankind to a new home in the stars, provided the “problem of gravity” can be solved by avuncular Professor Brand (Michael Caine).
Meanwhile, Right Stuff-style pilot-turned-farmer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is prompted by ghostly forces to lead an exploratory mission through a wormhole beyond the rings of Saturn, abandoning his family in search of a future for all humanity. What follows is a dizzying mash-up of The Haunting, Slaughterhouse-Five, Silent Running, Event Horizon and the director’s cut of Aliens, with the inverted time shifts of Inception (an hour on a distant planet equals lost years back on Earth) thrown in for extra emotional heft.
While it’s temptingly easy to cite 2001 (anything invoking a dimensional “star gate” triggers rarely positive Kubrick comparisons), the movie that hangs over Interstellar like the dust cloud atmospherically engulfing its earthbound scenes is Contact, with which it shares much more than just leading man McConaughey. Adapted from a novel by Carl Sagan (with signature input from Interstellar’s theoretical physicist Kip Thorne), Robert Zemeckis’s 1997 epic similarly centred on a daughter crying out to a lost father whose soul seems to abide somewhere across the universe.
In both movies, it is these daughters who detect the first stirrings of an “alien” encounter: Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) identifying recurrent sequences in the white noise of interstellar radiation in Contact; Murph (very affectingly played in her younger years by Mackenzie Foy) spying morse code in poltergeist disturbances in Interstellar. From such discoveries are missions launched, voyaging across time and space at the apparent instruction of a superior intelligence offering cryptic hands across the universe.
Intergalactic portals are breached, timescales bifurcated, science and faith reconciled. Crucially, for all their astro-maths exposition, the constant in both stories is neither time, space, nor gravity, but love. More than once I was reminded of Contact’s Ellie striking the outer limits of the universe and breathlessly declaring: “They should have sent a poet.” In dispatching Nolan beyond the stars, that’s exactly what they’ve done.
Despite the clunkiness of its dialogue (would an astronaut really need to have wormholes explained to him just as he approached one?) and ludicrousness of its plot (I can only accept the final 15 minutes if it’s all an illusion – which I suspect it isn’t), Interstellar is the work of someone who dreams with their eyes wide open. There is no one working in cinema today who has as much faith in the overwhelming power of the image as Nolan and who trusts their audience to be similarly awestruck. Like visionary film-maker Douglas Trumbull (who conjured 2001’s most memorable effects), Nolan’s primary register is light, and one can legitimately trace his love of celluloid back to the earliest experiments of Georges Méliès, who first used movies to send us on A Trip to the Moon in 1902. Watching Insterstellar, I felt connected to a century of mind-boggling spectacular cinema – to films such as The Ten Commandments, The Robe and Ben-Hur, which made you catch your breath at the sheer scope and intensity of the imagery. As Roy Batty says in Blade Runner: “I have seen things you people wouldn’t believe...”
Whether such ocular delights are enough to assuage any anxieties about the plot remains a moot point. Critics and audiences turned their noses up at Transcendence, the directorial debut from Nolan’s long-time director of photography Wally Pfister (here replaced by keen-eyed Hoyte van Hoytema) which was sneeringly dismissed by many as “Inception-lite”. Yet there is nothing in Pfister’s nostalgically ambitious directorial debut that is any more foolish than the heavily signposted twists and turns of Nolan’s latest.
Similarly, Gravity may have seemed philosophically flimsier, but it made more sense (and arguably pushed the visual effects envelope further) than Interstellar. Nolan’s regular composer Hans Zimmer has the measure of the madness, cooking up an eerie score that swerves from the creaky Goblin-esque horrors of mid-period Dario Argento to the imposing hallelujahs of what sounds like a massive church organ.
While the end result may not represent the pinnacle of Nolan’s extraordinary career, it nevertheless reaffirms him as cinema’s leading blockbuster auteur, a director who can stamp his singular vision on to every frame of a gargantuan team effort in the manner of Spielberg, Cameron and Kubrick. “Whose subconscious are we in?” asked Ellen Page in Inception. The answer here, as always, is unmistakably Nolan’s."
35,AKL_Doc5_Interstellar,AKL,Sci-Fi,Positive,Interstellar,"Interstellar begins more or less after the end. More or less, because the talking heads telling us about the end are evidently speaking from some later point in time, reminiscing about the doomed environment we are about to enter—an early signal that this movie will be a zone in which beginnings can never be presumed to precede endings. From what we can make out, civilization is smashed, in the wake of an apocalypse triggered by the effects of advanced technology. In a “post-Federal” Middle America, the surviving inhabitants cultivate cornfields as a last-ditch source of nourishment in the face of encroaching blights and dust storms that must soon render the Earth uninhabitable.
We become aware of lone individuals who may have it in them to redeem the lost world: Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former pilot who still dreams of space exploration, and his precocious young daughter, Murphy (Mackenzie Foy), who receives mysterious communications from what she believes to be a ghost or poltergeist. The signals from beyond are directing them toward a secret installation where scientists under the tutelage of a great astrophysicist (Michael Caine) work to perfect a means to escape from the dying Earth. The professor’s project requires sending Cooper, with a crew that includes the professor’s own daughter, Brand (Anne Hathaway), on a mission into another galaxy located somewhere in the vicinity of Saturn.
Yet as Cooper and his shipmates proceed into the farther reaches of their voyage—against a backdrop of spacecraft control panels and air hatches, moving at times through Kubrickian arcades of cosmic warp, alighting on worlds that are all mountainous waves or locked in ice—there is the deepening sense of approaching the limits of a livable human relation to space and time even while continuing by reflex to go through the motions of being human. They have reached the point where they can drop down from the spaceship onto a world where time passes at a different rate, and come back a few hours later to find out that they’ve been gone for 23 years. “I’m not afraid of death,” someone says, “I’m afraid of time.”
The whole movie comes to a stop for a moment with the blunt force of time’s horror and the insuperable barrier of human lifespan. We crosscut between parallel narratives and parallel galaxies, as the odds of bridging the abyss seem increasingly narrow. The arc of personal story—the drama of daughter’s abandonment by father evolving toward the drama of father’s rescue by daughter—is twined around the more elusive arc of wormhole physics with its promise of connections between points remote from each other in space and time.
Having set out to be a journey into what can hardly be depicted at all, Interstellar must find oblique ways of suggesting further imperceptible dimensions of the real. It is worth the journey to see what Nolan has constructed as a model of the unknowable. The end-of-the-world story changes into a beginning-of-the-world story, an optimistic paean to hidden human capabilities, holding out the possibility of a scarcely imaginable multidimensional future for the species—even if that future may require jettisoning much of what is supposed to be intrinsic to human identity.
The ghost story becomes a story of resurrection. Yet the ostensible optimism is underscored by a sustained note of mournful anxiety, with Dylan Thomas’s vibrant unconsoled threnody “Do not go gentle into that good night” repeatedly invoked. We are brought at last to an extraordinary transgalactic reunion at the brink of dissolution, an Einsteinian variant on the last scene of Mizoguchi’s Sansho the Bailiff. True to its obsession with recursive temporal arcs, Interstellar is a narrative that reveals itself not so much in the telling as in the playing back, as we make contact with an ending that was already the point of departure."
36,AKL_Doc6_Interstellar,AKL,Sci-Fi,Negative,Interstellar,"Yes, I recognize the egregious tardiness of this review. “Interstellar” has been out for over a week now. I’ve started and stopped writing about it a good, solid half dozen times, including a three-day hiatus while I was at a ladies’ getaway weekend in Palm Springs with a bunch of school moms. Being functional was not on the agenda. Now it’s time to buckle down and dig in, and I’ll try to do it with both the brevity and directness Christopher Nolan’s film is lacking. It’s a tricky thing, writing about “Interstellar.” Nolan’s latest provokes intense and conflicting reactions, more so than any of his previous films. (And for the record, I’ve been a fan — I love “Memento,” “Inception” and “The Dark Knight.” “The Dark Knight Rises,” not so much, as you may have heard.) It’s a film I didn’t exactly enjoy and can’t say I would recommend. And yet as an event, as a singular movie-watching opportunity, it’s undoubtedly worthwhile. How often do you get the chance to see a film projected in 70mm IMAX? It’s awesome and overwhelming, but also overbearing and ultimately kind of silly. But that’s only the beginning of the contradictions, which are many and maddening. Nolan’s space odyssey features some truly striking imagery, and you certainly have to appreciate that he remains a fervent champion of shooting on film. (Hoyte Van Hoytema, whose previous beautiful work includes Spike Jonze’s “Her” and the original Swedish vampire thriller “Let the Right One in,” is the cinematographer.) Individual moments of grandeur are jaw-dropping, including the sight of a spaceship passing as a tiny blip against a massive Saturn and its rings in various shades of brown and gray. But strangely, other shots – including some of the exterior of the ship against a vast blackness, or docking into a space station – look conspicuously like models. “Interstellar” boasts a strong cast filled with Oscar winners and nominees, and it places them in scenarios which are sprawling in their ambitions and dizzying in their scientific complexity. But then the dialogue they’re stuck working with often inspires either dozing or unintended giggling. The script — which Nolan wrote with his brother and frequent collaborator, Jonathan Nolan — is terrible. It alternates between dry and expository high-tech jargon and weepy, overly simplistic notions of love. Nolan is not exactly known as the most emotional director — although I appreciate the clockwork precision of his filmmaking — but here, when he tries to get a little gushy, the result is just laughable. That gushiness also comes with the accompaniment of a typically insistent Hans Zimmer score (which is different from the signature WHOMMM from “Inception,” FYI). But “Interstellar” also suffers from some muddled sound issues. You may find yourself straining to hear the dialogue at times — not that you’ll necessarily want to hear it. Another frustrating inconsistency comes from the film’s pacing, which alternates between draggy and relentless. It takes a long time to establish this post-apocalyptic near future, a withering place where farming has replaced technology as the planet’s primary purpose. And then, poof! Matthew McConaughey’s character is saying good-bye to his kids and heading into space, having been asked to commandeer a dangerous mission within minutes of discovering NASA’s clandestine headquarters. McConaughey’s Cooper is a widowed former astronaut now living in a modest farmhouse with his inquisitive daughter, Murphy (Mackenzie Foy), his teenage son, Tom (Timothee Chalamet), and his circumspect father-in-law, Donald (John Lithgow). It’s a world where the powers that be are erasing the accomplishments of the past, and where regular folks are struggling to survive just one more day. (The massive, Steinbeckian dust storms that smother and swallow everything are a frightening sight to behold.) As is the case with most McConaughey characters, Cooper gets by on his charm; “Interstellar” requires him to deliver many intricate lines, but doesn’t ask him to stray too far beyond his confident, charismatic persona. His strongest moments actually come when he’s playfully bantering on Earth with the spitfire Foy and earnestly promising he’ll come home to her. A series of mysterious signs leads Cooper and Murphy to NASA’s underground operations, and to some semblance of hope. As they learn from the dignified gentleman who runs the place, Professor Brand (Michael Caine, Nolan’s go-to voice of reason), a dozen brave pioneers shipped out a few years ago in search of other planets that might be habitable. They accessed these far-away lands through a wormhole near Saturn, which space aliens may or may not have placed there as a gift. (Who’s to say? Aliens are mysterious creatures.) Now, Cooper has the opportunity to save all of humanity by hopping inside a rocket with a group of brilliant scientists — as well as a clunky but omniscient HAL 9000-like robot named TARS, voiced by Bill Irwin — by visiting three of these planets which seem like the safest destinations. The only one of these supporting characters who gets much of a discernible personality is Brand’s daughter, Amelia (Anne Hathaway). “Interstellar” goes out of its way to establish her as supremely qualified for this mission — one of the top experts in her field — which is commendable. But eventually, the film reveals that it doesn’t think much of its women as it undermines both her and Jessica Chastain’s character, who arrives much later as the grown-up version of Murphy once decades have passed on Earth. (There’s a convoluted space-time continuum issue which complicates matters.) Both women are clearly geniuses, yet they make decisions based on romantic impulses which seem not just contradictory to their natures but stereotypically chickish. If I were an astronaut, I’d be seriously offended. Eventually, there is a massive, third-act twist. I’m not going to ruin it (although I have a theory about what’s actually going on with it). Regardless, it feels like a cheat, and it doesn’t work. “Interstellar” begins life with great aspirations and originality, but it ultimately devolves into a sorta-clever “Twilight Zone” episode. Still, if you’re going to see it, you may as well do so on the biggest screen you can find. Unfortunately, it won’t stay with you for long afterward."
37,AKL_Doc7_Interstellar,AKL,Sci-Fi,Negative,Interstellar,"Remember Gravity. Remember the simplicity, raw emotion, visual wonder, precision pacing and unpretentious central character in that space odyssey? Hold that thought. You’ll need to. Interstellar is no Gravity; it’s on a different flight pattern.
The script, by director/writer Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight) and his brother writer Jonathan Nolan, doesn’t let the film get off the ground, literally, for 50 minutes. It meticulously, laboriously sets up the back-story and the reason why a trip to outer space is a do-or-die mission. Somewhere in the future, Earth is experiencing severe environmental problems. The romance of the space program has vanished and day-to-day life is a struggle for the basics, like growing crops and surviving devastating dust storms. It’s a bleak world, indeed. There’s got to be a better place to live, right? We get it. Our selfish ways and disregard for the environment and climate change will become the bane of our existence. It’s not exactly an original premise, but let’s go with the flow.
Somewhere in farm country, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former astronaut and engineer, is a widowed, semi-contented farmer who grows a lot of corn. He lives with his father-in-law (John Lithgow), young son and moody little daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy). Murph is a bit weird. She thinks there are ghosts in her room who knock books off shelves. No one believes her, but Cooper eventually gets drawn into her world and thinks something strange is going on. 
The long intro, ad nauseam, wears out its welcome pretty fast. It doesn’t help that McConaughey’s interpretation of Cooper is the same spin he puts on his driver character in those incessant Lincoln MKC car commercials. It’s the same, folksy, laconic, soft-spoken, guy-next-door persona. It takes McConaughey almost the entire film to find a full range of emotions for his protagonist and to lose his car salesman shtick. And when he does, its as if he’s finally wiped the dog poop off his shoes.
Cooper and Murph stumble upon an underground, secret NASA headquarters. NASA has been abandoned and all but outlawed for years. The center is run by a Professor Brand (Michael Caine), who grimly tells Cooper that, according to his calculations, Earth will be uninhabitable in a generation or two. The only hope for humankind to survive is to find a new, hospitable home. He’s got his eyes set on a “wormhole” near Saturn. It’s a tube/tunnel made of spacetime that connects two different regions; theoretically, you could enter one side of the tube and exit the other end somewhere else in another time period. It could lead to a safe galaxy. He wants Cooper to head the mission. Cooper realizes that the expedition is necessary, dangerous and that he may never see his family again. Murphy catches on and doesn’t want dad to leave. Cooper departs, leaving behind an angst-riddled daughter.
Once Cooper, along with Brand’s scientist daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway) and a small crew leave earth, director Christopher Nolan finds his footing. This is the director of The Dark Knight and Inception. Making a journey to a far off galaxy look visually arresting is his strong suit. Action sequences are solid, from the blast off, to space station landings, to explorations on far off planets. He is far less able at making the characters have an emotional connection that matters. Cooper and Amelia don’t jibe. The angry daughter saga goes on far too long (has anyone ever heard of time out?) and well into adulthood when Murph (Jessica Chastain) has become a well-regarded scientist and her brother (Casey Affleck) a cynical farmer.
Back and forth scenes between space and Earth, where life in the outer galaxies remains the same and people on Earth age dramatically are fascinating at first. But they go on way too long. In fact at a staggering 169 minutes this well-intentioned film becomes intermittently engaging and lethargic. You’ll find yourself alternately fascinated and looking at your watch wondering if you can get home in time for dinner.
Two supporting characters were far more interesting to watch than the main cast. Wes Bentley (Cesar Chavez) and David Gyasi (Dark Knight Rises) play crewmembers and their performances are so understated you almost have to see the movie twice to understand how good they are. Hathaway, Caine and Lithgow have been a lot better in other movies. Chastain is fine, though again, she is stuck being angry, a trait that is not attractive. David Oyelowo and Ellen Burstyn have very little time on screen, but work their magic nonetheless. Topher Grace as Chastain’s love interest is utterly miscast.
The sound department must have been paid by the decibels. Did someone think that a deafening noise level could camouflage the slow parts? The set decoration (Gery Fettis, Changeling), production design (Nathan Crowley, The Dark Knight), cinematography (Hoyte Van Hoytema, The Fighter) and special effects are the film’s strongest assets, Oscar-worthy ones. The shots of Earth, with landscapes on the perpendicular, is a trick Nolan used to better effect in Inception. Film Editor Lee Smith (The Dark Knight) had perfect timing for the space shots and was asleep at the wheel for the Earth sequences.
This is an event movie. It’s a huge ($165 million budget) endeavor and admirable in a 2001: Space Odyssey kind of way. But compared to Gravity and the sensibility of director/writer Alfonso Cuarón Orozco, Interstellar, though ambitious and thrilling at points, is too complicated and doesn’t reach its full potential.
Cooper pines, “We used to look up at the sky and wonder about our place in the stars, now we just look down and wonder about our place in the dirt.” So why did the film spend so much needless time on Earth and not more time in space where it felt so right?"
38,AKL_Doc8_Interstellar,AKL,Sci-Fi,Negative,Interstellar,"""Interstellar"" is the biggest and boldest movie of the year, and also its most mystifying. It's a nearly three-hour event movie about quantum physics with deep philosophical quandaries about fate, the universe and our place in it. So, who wants popcorn?
It may well be the headiest blockbuster ever made, a literal deconstruction of time and space with a script that often feels like one of those complex equations that fill up entire chalkboards in movies. Thought ""Gravity"" was too simplistic with its handling of the mechanics of outer space? ""Interstellar"" is like advanced trigonometry, which will please Neil deGrasse Tyson, but will likely leave those without a complex understanding of astrophysics feeling cold.
""Interstellar"" comes from writer-director Christopher Nolan, who has dedicated himself to making bigger, better, smarter blockbusters since he was handed the keys to the ""Batman"" franchise back in 2005. In between his second and third ""Batman"" movies, he made ""Inception,"" a hugely ambitious rumination on dreams wrapped inside a riveting, pulse-pounding action film. It was 2010's best movie, mainly because it dared to present ideas and play with the audience's heads in summertime, that most mindless of movie seasons.
""Inception"" asked a lot of viewers, but its most confounding moments are a mere jumping off point for ""Interstellar."" (Think of it as ""Interstellarception."") It's perhaps unfair to grouse about the brainlessness of movies like ""Transformers"" and then get frustrated with a movie as challenging as ""Interstellar,"" but ""Interstellar"" goes way off the deep end. Nolan is wrestling with issues of artistic ambition vs. audience expectations, but he errs on the wrong side and leaves viewers behind as he takes off for the cosmos. Hey Chris, do us a favor and let us know when you come back down to Earth, OK?
Matthew McConaughey is Cooper, a widower with a teenage son (Tom) and a pre-teen daughter (Murph) living in America's heartland, or at least what's left of it. They live in a near-future where food is scarce, massive dust storms are making the planet uninhabitable and NASA scientists are working in secret to find a new planet, or universe, to colonize. Cooper is a former NASA pilot who is recruited to head up a mission to scope out new planets, but to do, so he must leave his children behind. He does — Murph takes it very hard — and heads to the far reaches of the galaxy with a crew that includes fellow pilots Amelia (Anne Hathaway) and Doyle (Wes Bentley), as well as a pair of robots.
As Cooper and his crew head off, they explore the time-space continuum, gravitational pulls, wormholes, black holes and, at one point, the chemical properties of love; the dialogue is at times so alienating it feels like you're eavesdropping on a conversation between nuclear scientists. (For homework, there are stacks of literary references to wade through, from Dylan Thomas to Stephen King to Arthur Conan Doyle.)
Nolan's visuals are impeccable, and Hans Zimmer's walloping score pounds with urgency. The performances are solid across the board, especially from McConaughey, who is sturdy, strong and cool as the movie's hero. ""Interstellar"" is likely to spark strong debates from supporters and quick dismissals from naysayers, while stoners will spend countless viewings searching for which Yes album it syncs to seamlessly.
""Interstellar"" is a grand undertaking, but in shooting for the stars, it loses its footing. It goes to infinity and beyond, when infinity would have been plenty."
39,AKL_Doc9_Interstellar,AKL,Sci-Fi,Negative,Interstellar,"Christopher Nolan is, by almost any standard, a monumental figure in the landscape of contemporary cinema. He has enjoyed a near-unblemished track record of massive box-office success for going on a decade. He has remained committed to shooting on film in the face of an almost industrywide shift towards digital, which he has been a most reasonable voice in opposition to, and he has used his pull to make sure that cinemas equipped to project his latest, Interstellar, in either 35 or 70mm, will get first dibs on playing it for a paying audience. As the blockbuster has become increasingly formulaic, made-by-committee, and dependent on tie-in world-building – see for example Marvel Films’ recent unveiling of their release strategy for the next several lifetimes – Nolan, after his three Batman films, has evinced an interest in making big movies that are self-contained, freestanding edifices, bearing a personal imprint.
All of this is, on paper at least, to the good. So it is without great relish that I must report that Interstellar, like Inception before it, is a movie that feels like being tangled up in a pile of infinitely-unfolding some-assembly-required instructions in the watching, full of dialogue that’s like the recital of a How To manual.
As in Inception, there is a lot of explaining-what-is-going-on-right-now-at-great-length in Interstellar, though happily this time most of the exposition comes from Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway at their most appealing, rather than from Leo DiCaprio in the dregs of his bottomless-anguish phase. The movie gives McConaughey at least one knockout, Oscar-reel scene, though the premise behind it is so intrinsically moving that it would almost be impossible to fudge.
Leading a desperate, last-ditch-attempt mission to find a new, habitable home for the residents of a fatally-blighted earth, McConaughey’s space pilot Cooper (as in Gary) and Hathaway’s scientist Amelia (as in Earhart) Brand touch down on a candidate planet where, for every hour they spend on the surface, seven years will have passed in earth time. Returning in their landing craft a few hours later to dock in the orbiting space station – it looks like a lazily-revolving sprinkler spigot – Cooper catches up on his video messages from earth from the son and a daughter, Tom and Murphy, who he left behind as children, and who’ve now grown to become his near-contemporaries. (They’ve aged into Casey Affleck and Jessica Chastain, respectively.)
McConaughey’s emotional dam burst at this moment is ragged and startling, and for this moment, at least, Nolan realises his movie’s evident ambition – to create a work at once intimate and cosmic in scope, in which the fate of humanity depends on what happens in one little girl’s bedroom, and the survival of the family of man hinges on one man’s family. When Cooper first decides to take on the mission which may very well separate him from his children forever, the roar of his Dodge Ram pickup blasting down the gravel driveway matches to the sound of his shuttle taking off – leaving earth is almost an afterthought after leaving home.
In Interstellar, the business of saving humanity is very much a local matter. Cooper and Murphy’s pained parting begins when inexplicable forces lead ex-astronaut-next-door Cooper to the headquarters of NASA, seemingly just a couple of counties over. Until Cooper takes leave of his home planet, presenting the opportunity for an orbital perspective, the movie shows us nothing more of that planet than a John Cougar Mellencamp-esque version of the American heartland, Smallville in extremis. This is all that remains after a mass depopulation in the wake of a crop blight which affected every staple but corn, which has forced America (and presumably whatever is left of the rest of the planet) to dedicate itself completely to agrarian pursuits. Nothing is heard of the wider world, or even the big cities of the United States – though we do see the New York Yankees, reduced to a barnstorming team playing Little League-sized ballfields.
The mood is very much loss-of-national-purpose-and-resolve, faded stars-and-stripes downbeat in the key of Merle Haggard’s Are the Good Times Really Over, with McConaughey kicking back on his porch and musing “It’s like we’ve forgotten who we are: explorers, pioneers, not caretakers.” Even the school textbooks actively discourage big dreams now, teaching that the moon landing was faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union. It’s a cheap, baldfaced appeal to a battered sense of American pride that belies the movie’s cerebral pretensions, and when the head of the exiled NASA, one Dr. Brand (Michael Caine) – Amelia’s father, as it happens – tells long-earthbound space cowboy Cooper “I can’t tell you any more unless you agree to pilot this craft,” it feels closer to Michael Bay’s Armageddon than to a certain movie in the Kubrick catalogue.
Interstellar can do awesome, as you’d hope a film that commanded the resources of two major studios (Paramount and Warner Bros.) should. The movie, which I saw as it was meant to be seen, on a three-storey IMAX screen, is striated with images conveying sheer vastness: Cooper’s family farm a lone beacon in the country night, devastating dust storms and tidal waves approaching on the horizon, Cooper’s craft dwarfed in passing near the rings of Saturn. There is a marvellous set piece that begins with a flailing fight for the future of humanity on the stark surface of a distant, dead planet – something like the end of Von Stroheim’s Greed in spacesuits – and ends with Cooper docking his landing craft to a spinning-out-of-control station which ranks as the single greatest accomplishment of Nolan in his master-engineer mode.
As spectacle, Interstellar is a fitful success. Nolan, however, isn’t content with Ooohs and Ahhhs. Pursuing a passion for involuted chronology which dates to early efforts with longtime co-screenwriter brother Jonathan like Following (1998) and Memento (2000), their Interstellar is contorted around various temporal shifts. Early on we’re shown talking head interviews with elderly eyewitnesses who are evidently survivors of the earth’s death, speaking of the present in which the film opens as a distant past, and thus giving the movie a long-view perspective, actively nullifying any suspense as to the question of humanity’s chances of enduring. Later, when Cooper stumbles onto a line of communication which allows him to deliver messages to earth across time and space, Nolan comes very near to the territory of Inception, using state-of-the-art special effects – here a mise-en-abyme pseudo-Borgesian library – to create visual corollaries to the birth of inspiration. The climax, I fear, requires Chastain to hoot “Eureka!”
What can you say about an artist who, when seeking to celebrate revelatory vision and the indomitability of the human spirit, goes about doing so almost entirely through cliché? Caine’s Dr. Brand giving a hoary recital of Dylan Thomas’s Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night provides the movie a sort-of refrain – “Oh Captain! My Captain!” was, of course, already taken. The comic relief is courtesy Cooper’s blocky robot companion TARS, whose wisecracking is dictated by the level of his humour setting. This is seemingly meant as a play on the formulaic nature of screenwriting – the executive request to “Dial up the comedy a little” – but the self-aware acknowledgement doesn’t make it any less formulaic, nor does it make the no-fun Nolans any more adept at lightening the mood.
Where skeptics like myself will cry cliché, Nolan’s partisans will undoubtedly see an artist working in the powerful, primal medium of archetypes. But archetypes need a hard and clear glint, so to be comprehensible at a glance, while Interstellar proves true to Nolan’s habit of swaddling his movies in layers of exposition and explanation, here effectively dulling the emotional effects of his last act.
A recent New York Times profile exalted Nolan’s micromanagement, but in practice it makes for rather suffocating storytelling – with the punctilious explanations he has his actors narrate, he’s like an over-solicitous host whose attention keeps you from ever getting comfortable. Consequently, when Cooper, still a fit fortysomething, is reunited with his daughter, now a very old and dying woman, the scene is considerably less persuasive and moving than that between Chris Evans’s unfrozen Captain and Hayley Atwill’s Peggy Carter, his sweetheart from the WWII days, in this year’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier – the very cookie-cutter entertainment that Christopher Nolan is supposedly saving us from.
In a hopeless multiplex present, Nolan has been tasked with the impossible job of leading the way to a better future, providing the legendary ‘blockbuster with brains’. With the year’s umpteenth paean to the nigh-supernatural power of fatherhood, all he’s provided is another harvest of corn."
40,AKL_Doc10_Interstellar,AKL,Sci-Fi,Negative,Interstellar,"Is it unfair to point up the modest levels of brightness on display here by observing that, when pondering the challenges of mortality, Interstellar drags out Dylan Thomas’s too-obvious Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night?
We should certainly avoid comparing the film’s engagement with astrophysics – fling buckets of gee-whiz science randomly at the screen and see what sticks – with Russell Brand’s approach to political philosophy. No. Let’s do neither of those things.
After all, Christopher Nolan has spent millions manufacturing an apocalyptic fable that makes an effort to exercise the frontal lobes. Offering tribute to Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey when aloft and Terrence Malick’s Days of Heaven when in the cornfields, Interstellar swells with solid work by gifted professionals: Hans Zimmer slumps on the biggest pipe organ in town; the decision to use the minimum of CGI gives the images welcome weight; Hoyte van Hoytema’s smoky cinematography is seductive throughout. Maybe, we’ll just not mention the cluttered storytelling and hairpin-turn philosophising.
Matthew McConaughey plays Cooper, a farmer, once a NASA engineer, who, like the rest of the Earth’s hungry population, is trying to cope in a future whose dystopian blueprints are never fully revealed to the audience. Something is causing the crops to fail. The US government insists that children be taught the moon landings were faked. Third-level education is now only for a tiny elite. As dust storms sweep across the plains, Cooper is lured to a mysterious location where an old chum (Nolan talisman Michael Caine) reveals secret plans to save the world.
Here’s where the science begins to get decidedly insecure. In a blasé tone that suggests such things are more common than badgers, we are told that a wormhole has been located somewhere in the vicinity of Saturn. As a result of mad luck (unlikely) or divine planning (vaguely hinted at), this gap in spacetime takes us to a corner of the universe peppered with potentially welcoming planets. Carter bids a tearful farewell to his clever daughter (Mackenzie Foy) and joins a party of explorers on a trip to the ringed planet. If things go very well, an ark of humans will eventually follow. If things don’t go quite so well, the new planet will be populated with a cache of fertilised eggs. A third, worst option doesn’t bear thinking about.
The travellers’ first stop on a watery planet with stronger gravity than our own features the film’s very best scenes. Cinema has far too rarely allowed characters to encounter the potential strangeness of other worlds. The crew’s engagement with a vast, slow moving tidal wave is more resonant than a thousand showdowns with lizard people in camp space operas.
Sadly, the film then gets fatally bogged down in a series of unnecessarily abundant narrative tendrils. One planet promises certain advantages. Another requires a manoeuvre that, thanks to the intricacies of relativity, will cause the crew to lose years of time in a few short hours. A late plot twist suggests that the crew may not have been told the entire truth about the mission. One gets the sense of Nolan and his brother Jonathan – collaborating on the screenplay as ever – flailing to fill up the vast running time with any available padding. By comparison, 2001 seems like a model of storytelling purity.
There are more profound problems with the piece. For most of its duration, Interstellar makes a powerful argument for the theory that humans endure as a result of an individual desire to stay alive – not because of any less self-centred urge to protect the wider species. Yet an effort is made to accommodate this harsh realism with the notion, that love can change the universe (or something).
The philosophical wooliness is in keeping with a project that, for all its many technical accomplishments, feels slightly thrown together. Interstellar is beautiful, dazzling and astonishingly loud, but, alas, it is remains something of a mess at the level of the script. A magnificent folly."
41,RSR_Doc1_Lamb,RSR,Horror,Negative,Lamb,"Since the early days of the company’s history, A24 has declared itself to be one of the most prolific and unique distributors when it comes to modern horror. While this identity has led to the discovery of modern masters of the genre like Ari Aster and Robert Eggers, it has also led to some horrific miscalculations. Debuting at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival, Valdimar Jóhannsson's Lamb adds another inspired addition to this list of releases. Taking place on a farm in Iceland, the troubled couple of María (Noomi Rapace) and Ingvar (Hilmir Snær Guðnason) are helping their sheep give birth when one produces an offspring unlike any other. While it contains the head of a lamb, the body is that of a human child. Maria and Ingvar immediately take it in as their own child almost with a silent agreement of what this means to the both of them following recent events within their relationship. Tensions rise as a mysterious entity begins to lurk outside and Ingvar's brother Pétur (Björn Hlynur Haraldsson) visits the family.
If there is one thing to say about Lamb in a positive sense it would be how engrossing the film feels in its setting. Opening on a cold Christmas-eve blizzard and quickly transitioning to a stunning Icelandic spring, Lamb is undeniably an aesthetically beautiful film, almost capturing the environmental majesty found in projects like The Sound of Music. The vibrance of the endless green grass mixed with dense clouds and fogs surrounding the nearby mountains creates a beautiful isolation. Cinematographer Eli Arenson provides thoughtfully shot composition and framing that consistently goes back to the natural life on the farm. From the sheep together in the barn to a cat and dog roaming outside, the film continues to go back to animals to find its sources of tension and atmosphere which feel both raw and uncanny compared to what is normally provided.
The acting is also rather undeniable. While both Hilmir Snær Guðnason and Björn Hlynur Haraldsson get their moments to shine in their displays of lackluster masculinity, Noomi Rapace steals the show with a genuinely masterful performance that is clearly too good for the content she is given throughout the feature. Rapace is vulnerable and desperate while still maintaining a confidence and strength. She might be defenseless to her inner demons and emotional trauma but is still very much in control of how she deals with those around her as seen when Pétur continually tries to make sexual advancements towards her. The best moments of Lamb are when these three are hanging out, getting drunk, and having fun. Largely, these scenes are the only scenes in the feature that feel like they have a personality or infections energy as sadly the rest of the film comes across as beyond boring and dull.
For a film with such a unique and out-there concept, Lamb sadly feels largely hollow and bland. While there are various conversations started throughout the film's 106-minute runtime, the majority of the film is spent sitting with these characters on the farm with nothing of true substance fully solidifying. One could look at Lamb as a tale of blindly attempting to find closure from grief but its fantastical elements neglect this conversation. It also seems like the film might be curious at looking at the concept of farming and how humanity treats species differently but this also is confusingly neglected from a narrative standpoint. The decision to make the half-sheep half-human child which gets named Ada be a hybrid actually feels like a damming choice the film makes. 
While on paper, it undeniably helps the film stand out, narratively the film does nothing with this choice and instead attempts to have conversations that clearly would work best if Ada was simply pure sheep. Without massive changes to the focus however, this change still wouldn't have been enough to save the feature overall. It also is incredibly problematic for the film's effectiveness to have the character have the face of a lamb. The film will use intimate shots of Ada to convey emotion as a film would a human actor. This fails, however, as lambs do not have that expressive of faces and audiences naturally don't know how to read them anyway. When it cuts to Ada, it is hard without context clues to figure out what emotion is being portrayed, yet the film has full confidence in this choice for some reason.
Without getting into spoilers, the final 10-minutes of the film also demands discussion. While Lamb might be marketed as a horror film, this identity only comes through in the vague creature lurking outside which comes up only a couple of times throughout the film before its conclusion. This concept is nothing new for the horror genre but it must be said how refreshing it feels for a film to go for it without needing to use cheap tricks like dream sequences. There is a definitive end and answer to this mystery, and while it means absolutely nothing to the wider film and comes out of nowhere with the audience being none the wiser the film is ending even 10-minutes before the credits roll, it still at least feels respectable within the genre it belongs to.
Lamb is a difficult film to process fully. While it is clearly a film with potential both thematically and technically, outside of Noomi Rapace, it really struggles to leave an impact. It is simply boring with nothing of note or importance forming. It almost is frustrating how uninteresting Lamb ends up being, considering its potential, but the audience will likely be so bored by the viewing experience that even the fire given by this anger will die rather quickly. 
"
42,RSR_Doc2_Lamb,RSR,Horror,Positive,Lamb,"A perfect dichotomy of humor and tragedy, Lamb sneaks its way to the front of the line as a long-term festival favorite. Directed by Valdimar Jóhannsson, the feature film had its premiere at the 74th Festival de Cannes on July 13, 2021. It was praised and rewarded for its inventiveness, earning it the Un Certain Regard Prize for Originality. 
The film follows a childless couple, María (Noomi Rapace) and Ingvar (Hilmir Snær Guðnason), in Iceland that lives on a remote farm. One day after unusual circumstances, they discover a mysterious newborn. This serves as a second chance at being a family again. Unfortunately, miracles come at a cost. 

Essentially, it explores the trials of family through love and loss. Some might compare it to Midsommar when it comes to holding a magnifying glass to grief. How it manifests itself in unconventional ways. The Icelandic atmospheric horror picture loses itself in suspenseful pacing. The film itself thrives in stillness. Jóhannsson allows the spectator to live in the moment. It is a lively folkloric tale that dances between light and dark. Despite it not being traditional horror, Lamb begs you to lean in close and pay attention. As well, it is surprisingly humorous. Many moments lend themselves to natural comedic relief that sets up a perfect balance.
Its small cast also plays into the simplicity of it all. With minimal to no dialogue at times, the beautiful landscapes captured by long camera shots speak volumes on their own. Jóhannsson’s work on this piece often embodies the quick wit and clever depth of an epic, enveloping its audience in cleverly divided stanzas.

43,RSR_Doc3_Lamb,RSR,Horror,Positive,Lamb,"A perfect dichotomy of humor and tragedy, Lamb sneaks its way to the front of the line as a long-term festival favorite. Directed by Valdimar Jóhannsson, the feature film had its premiere at the 74th Festival de Cannes on July 13, 2021. It was praised and rewarded for its inventiveness, earning it the Un Certain Regard Prize for Originality. 
The film follows a childless couple, María (Noomi Rapace) and Ingvar (Hilmir Snær Guðnason), in Iceland that lives on a remote farm. One day after unusual circumstances, they discover a mysterious newborn. This serves as a second chance at being a family again. Unfortunately, miracles come at a cost. 

Essentially, it explores the trials of family through love and loss. Some might compare it to Midsommar when it comes to holding a magnifying glass to grief. How it manifests itself in unconventional ways. The Icelandic atmospheric horror picture loses itself in suspenseful pacing. The film itself thrives in stillness. Jóhannsson allows the spectator to live in the moment. It is a lively folkloric tale that dances between light and dark. Despite it not being traditional horror, Lamb begs you to lean in close and pay attention. As well, it is surprisingly humorous. Many moments lend themselves to natural comedic relief that sets up a perfect balance.

Its small cast also plays into the simplicity of it all. With minimal to no dialogue at times, the beautiful landscapes captured by long camera shots speak volumes on their own.

44,RSR_Doc4_Lamb,RSR,Horror,Positive,Lamb,"Lamb is what characters from the latest Scream movie would describe as ‘elevated horror’—a scary movie that is ‘about something’. The self-aware, cine-literate Scream characters would be right, of course, but only partially. Directed by debutant Valdimar Jóhannsson from a script he co-wrote with the Icelandic multi-hyphenate Sjón, Lamb is certainly ‘about something’, but it’s not the sort of folk horror film that fans of, say, Midsommar, would go in expecting. It is, instead, a ‘dark fantasy’–the sort of movie that Guillermo del Toro would’ve made had he been born 20 years later, in a different hemisphere.
Like Ari Aster’s Midsommar (and fellow arthouse horror films such as The VVitch, Hereditary, and Saint Maud) Lamb is also produced by the chic indie outfit A24, which, over the last decade, has built the sort of brand identity that brings to mind the Fox Searchlight days. Telling you that Lamb is an A24 movie does a better job at explaining what you’re in for than any logline I can paraphrase. But I’ll give it a shot, nonetheless.

Set in an isolated farm in rural Iceland—the movie literally has just three speaking parts—Lamb tells the twisted story of Maria and Ingvar, a grieving couple living a quiet life away from civilisation. Played by Noomi Rapace and Hilmir Snær Guðnason, Maria and Ingvar are stunned one day, when a sheep in their stable gives birth to a part-human offspring. They take the human-sheep hybrid as their own, naming it Ada after their deceased daughter.
Maria and Ingvar’s blissful new life is rudely interrupted by Ada’s biological mother, who begins lurking around their house, bleating away for hours as it tries to catch her attention, and Ingvar’s rugged brother, Pétur, who is less a character than a convenient plot mechanic, designed specifically to introduce conflict to the proceedings. He is also the first outsider, so to speak, to catch a glimpse of Ada. But after initially reacting in shock to what Maria and Ingvar are doing, he develops a soft corner for her. There’s a sense that Pétur was somewhat of a black sheep as well, so it makes sense for him, in the fantastical world of the film, to behave in this manner.
Deliberately paced and as emotionally frigid as the vast landscape against which it is set, Lamb is an unsettling but demanding examination of trauma, loneliness and motherhood, sometimes together. The perpetual daytime setting isn’t as heightened as what we saw in the very sunny Midsommar, but it certainly contributes to the film’s eerie atmosphere, and a sense that what Maria and Ingvar are experiencing is not unlike a waking nightmare. The wide-screen cinematography, on the other hand, emphasises the characters’ emotional and physical isolation.
More adventurous interpretations of the film’s fable-like form could suggest that it is a metaphorical representation of Iceland’s geo-political outsider-status—it is a country that more or less minds its own business, and maintains an arm’s distance from not just the rest of the world, but also other Nordic states. Lamb is many things, but ironically, it’s not what most people would specifically expect it to be.
On the sole occasion that it flirts with the conventional language of horror cinema, it does so not with a roar but a mumble, deliberately underplaying a moment that, in virtually any other scary movie, would have been accompanied by a loud sound effect. You’ll know it when you see it. In fact, such is its dedication to not offering a helping hand to struggling audiences, that it barely even has a musical score, or much dialogue. More often than not, you’re left to find your own way through, as if you’ve actually been stranded at the side of an Icelandic fjord.
The film’s most prominent emotional anchor—or, a sort of umbilical cord—is Rapace’s magnificent central performance. As the grieving Maria, she is stoic and sad; frenzied and fierce. What he doesn’t convey through traditional techniques such as sound and music, Jóhannsson communicates with the help of Rapace’s face. In a way, it’s a more impressive special effect than whatever they’ve done to create Ada.
Hers is the sort of genre film turn that routinely goes unnoticed by awards groups, and is easily more nuanced than at least two performances currently nominated in the Best Actress category at the Oscars.

45,RSR_Doc5_Lamb,RSR,Horror,Positive,Lamb,"A farming couple adopt a strange hybrid child in this delightfully strange Icelandic folk horror from debut director Valdimar Jóhannsson. Suffused with slow-burn tension and showcasing some inspired special-effects work, this is one of the best genre films of the year. Matthew Turner hides the mint sauce.
The debut feature from Icelandic director Valdimar Jóhannsson, this slow-burn horror begins with a terrific opening shot, as a group of wild horses emerge from the fog in a rural landscape and are promptly spooked by something the audience can't see, something that forces them to retreat in panic. That same something – whose snort-like breathing sounds decidedly non-human – then approaches a shed on a sheep farm and singles out one of the ewes, who stares straight into the camera as the whatever-it-is ominously approaches.
The sheep farm in question belongs to Maria (Noomi Rapace) and her husband, Ingvar (Hilmir Snær Gudnason), who spend their days together in near silence, both deep in grief after the loss of a child. However, when one of their ewes gives birth to a mysterious hybrid creature, their lives are transformed, as they decide to adopt the child and raise it as their own. 
Initially, all seems well. Maria and Ingvar name the child Ada and she, in turn, brings light and happiness into their lives. Then Ingvar's ne'er-do-well brother Pétur (Björn Hlynur Haraldsson) arrives, immediately shattering the idyllic family unit by blurting out, “What the fuck is this?”
Noomi Rapace delivers one of her best performances to date as Maria (an aptly symbolic name), conveying a wealth of emotional information with just the look in her eyes. The scene where the (unseen) baby is born and the camera switches back and forth between Maria and Ingvar's faces, without either of them saying anything, is a masterclass in facial expression acting, as their initial shock and horror turns into something very different.
Hilmir Snær Gudnason and Björn Hlynur Haraldsson are equally good as the two brothers, both of whom spark contrasting chemistry with Rapace. Similarly, their interactions with Ada are set against each other in a way that provokes compelling suspense – Ingvar is paternal, loving and concerned, while Pétur appears to transform into a benevolent uncle, but may be hiding darker intentions. 
Valdimar Jóhannsson (who co-wrote the script with Sjón) proves a master at the slow burn, drip-feeding information in a way that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. It's a full forty minutes, for example, until the audience first sees what Ada actually looks like in full, even if they may well have guessed the details beforehand.
On that note, the film is heightened by some terrific special-effects work on Ada that opts for a clever splicing of two different elements rather than straightforward CGI animation. The effect is both unique and utterly charming – the audience ends up falling for Ada just the way that Maria and Ingvar do, thanks to the superlative cuteness of the creature design.
The film also deserves praise for its phenomenal animal wrangling across the board. In addition to the wild horses in the opening shot, Valdimar Jóhannsson get astonishing performances from a variety of sheep (one in particular is heartbreaking), the family dog and the family cat, who can be relied upon for an audience-pleasing reaction shot at any given moment. 
The script is superb, balancing both a powerfully engaging family drama about loss, grief and perhaps madness with elements of folk horror and the increasingly chilling idea that this mysterious thing has brought happiness, but with a pervasive sense of a dark debt being accrued in the process. Without giving anything away, the climax pays off the lengthy slow burn in spectacular fashion, with a truly terrifying ending that will leave your jaw on the floor.
In short, this is a stunning horror debut that immediately marks out Jóhannsson as a serious talent to watch, thanks to his assured tonal control and a riveting blend of tension, horror and Icelandic deadpan humour. This is, quite simply, unmissable, and one of the best films of the year."
46,RSR_Doc6_Lamb,RSR,Horror,Positive,Lamb,"Lamb joins A24‘s growing list of horror dramas. It’s earnest, atmospheric, and periodically abstract. It’s slow-moving and doesn’t have much of a big climax to speak of, but it’s a solid exploration of the relationship between nature and the human condition. Sjón and Valdimar Jóhannsson’s horror screenplay contains very little dialogue, although Jóhannsson’s direction is meaningful and substantial.
Married and childless couple Maria (Noomi Rapace) and Ingvar (Hilmir Snær Guðnason) live a quiet life alone on their farm in Iceland. They spend their days doing chores around the farm and tending to the animals. However, it’s clear that there’s an unspoken tension that has created a wedge between the couple.
Maria and Ingvar’s lives change when one of their sheep gives birth to an odd lamb-human hybrid. The couple decides to take the creature in, name her Ada, and raise her as their own. However, their strange new child creates issues with Ingvar’s critical brother Pétur (Björn Hlynur Haraldsson) and Ada’s sheep mother. Maria and Ingvar are willing to do anything to protect their new happy family.
Lamb‘s story is told over the course of three chapters separated by title cards. The film follows Maria and Ingvar as they do their chores as if they’re just simply going through the motions. The married couple occupies the same physical space, but it’s clear that their minds are in totally different places. Ingvar brings up that time travel is theoretically possible. Maria assumes that someone must be figuring out the practical details. It’s clear that they aren’t living in the present.
The farm is removed from society and all of its expectations and judgments. It almost exists outside of time. Chapter two sees the introduction of Ingvar’s brother, Pétur. He’s a member of the family, but he doesn’t share their love for Ada. Pétur comedically brings in the confusion and shock to the absurd situation that his brother and sister-in-law are raising a lamb-hybrid as their child.
Once you get on Lamb‘s strange wavelength, it’s exactly what A24 sells it to be. It’s a peculiar horror folk tale that goes as far as it needs to make its point. The meaning is set around nature, family, loss, and both the nurturing and destructive nature of humanity. However, the natural order of things isn’t always very kind to people.
Jóhannsson’s directorial style makes Lamb feel timeless. Time is often standing still for Maria and Ingvar, but Ada is an opportunity for them to move forward together as a family. The farm is surrounded by gorgeous landscapes that create an openness that’s quickly taken away by a thick, mysterious layer of fog that traps the audience in. Þórarinn Guðnason’s score contributes to that feeling with subtle music that’s filled with both sorrow and dread.
Lamb has only three lead roles, which allows the movie to really center around them. Rapace turns in a nuanced performance. Maria has a lot on her mind, but never truly communicates all that she means to say. Rapace does a wonderful job translating her character’s pain and sorrow, but also her hope for a better life after finding Ada. Guðnason’s Ingvar is a bit more talkative, but he lands all of the subtleties. He often puts on a face for Maria, only to break down in quiet moments alone. Guðnason pairs extraordinarily well with Rapace. Finally, Haraldsson brings excellent comedic timing to Pétur with his physical reactions.
Sjón and Jóhannsson’s screenplay is thin and doesn’t satisfy on a narrative level. Lamb leaves the audience with more questions than answers. It has no interest in leaving you feeling fulfilled or satisfied. But, that isn’t the point of the A24 film. Lamb blends humor, dread, and sorrow into one picture, providing commentary on the human journey. The slow pacing can be trying and its direction is a bit predictable, but it’s a unique film experience that is equal parts peculiar and absorbing.
"
47,RSR_Doc7_Lamb,RSR,Horror,Negative,Lamb,"There no other obvious way to start this review than by saying: Lamb is an odd one. Beautiful; sure. Evocative; yes. However, it only tantalises at the mythology or events which underpin the narrative, and as such the world it offers is a partial one. How forgiving you are of this will depend on how you weight aesthetics and mood against old fashioned coherence.
Lamb is loosely based on a story from Icelandic folklore – though you would only know that if you’d read the film’s ‘liner notes’ – and it features a married couple, Maria (Noomi Rapace) and Ingvar (Hilmir Snær Guðnaso). They are sheep farmers somewhere in remote Iceland, a thankless enough task, but one underpinned by a certain lack of communication between them; they simply get on with the jobs at hand. Other critiques have noted their relationship as characterised by deep misery, though this reviewer didn’t read it as anything that severe, more a kind of unsaid acceptance of their lot. Things are about to change, however. At winter, something ‘other than normal’ seems to be threatening their flock (and one of the things which this film does amazingly is to show animals apparently getting into their acting roles). Come lambing season, one of their ewes delivers a lamb with some sort of as-yet unseen difference. Rather than placing the lamb back with its mother, Maria takes it – wrapping it with a shawl as if it was a human baby. This all happens very early on in the film, by the way, so hopefully isn’t a spoiler; more anon.
At this point, her decision to do so is a mystery; likewise, the acceptance of this lamb, christened ‘Ada’ by Maria, simply takes place with a largely accepting response from Ingvar. Maria’s maternal jealousy swiftly shapes events for the worse, but it’s the fact that Ada seems to be some kind of human-sheep hybrid which begs the most questions; neither ‘parent’ questions it. The return of Ingvar’s brother Petur (Björn Hlynur Haraldsson) affords the script one or two opportunities to question this bizarre course of events, but other than generating a handful of suggestions of some kind of sexual undertone between Maria and Petur, simply slots another family member into this set-up. We simply observe what Ingvar refers to as their “happiness” in raising little Ada.
The film is sweet and considerate of this happiness, and this is one of its key strengths. Indeed, Lamb did not turn out as I expected, which was either as a symbolic exploration of the pain of loss, or a riff on the perils of nurturing unnatural offspring – something like Grace (2009). Lamb is neither of those, and Ada – even as a CGI-generated entity – is a pleasant little critter; director Valdimar Jóhannsson has done a great job capturing the nuances and commonplace gestures of small children, even if said small child isn’t your average child (can we also assume that putting Ada in a wool sweater was an example of the film’s few moments of dark humour?) But in focusing on this meandering family bliss, the film omits things, choosing to say almost nothing about bereavement or the impact of it. There are gaps, which prioritise atmosphere, but at some expense to how easy it is to engage with these events. Given that the film opts for the trendy device of adding on-screen title chapters, there must have been some awareness of providing structure and linearity, but it doesn’t really arrive. (That being said, do not watch the film trailer, which condenses down all the measurable plot points and therefore ruins them in ways which no review has done).
Lamb has many merits – its performances, its terrific setting, its quite unique strangeness – but it can’t quite offset its omissions with these. Taken as a whole, though, it’s a gentle and considerate piece of work which will charm many viewers with its careful ambience.

48,RSR_Doc8_Lamb,RSR,Horror,Negative,Lamb,"On a remote sheep farm in picturesque but rugged Iceland, childless couple Maria (Noomi Rapace) and Ingvar (Hilmir Snær Guðnason) have their workaday lives disrupted when one of their sheep gives birth to a human hybrid. Naming the unnerving creature Ada, they decide to bring it into their home and raise it as their own—a replacement for the child it is heavily implied that they lost some time in the past.
Ensconced in familial bliss, it takes the arrival of Petur (Björn Hlynur Haraldsson), Ingvar’s tearaway brother, to point out just how weird a lamb-headed toddler really is. Just what brought the creature forth? And what is the ominous presence in the nearby mountains that seems to be searching for it?
Lamb is being marketed as a horror movie and while it certainly borrows some tones from that genre, anyone expecting a conventional fright flick is going to come away confused. Even for an A24 joint, Lamb colours outside the commonly accepted genre lines, touching on notes of folk horror and luxuriating in the chilly, bleak atmosphere of its location. Its story wrings a lot of mileage out of the empty, unnerving presence of the flocks of sheep that drift in and out of the story, a mute Greek chorus to witness a story that unfolds at a gradual, near-glacial pace. That story is a meditation on loss, love, grief, and parenthood, told through long silences and carefully constructed tableaux.
All of this comes to us from first time director Valdimar Johannsson, a protégé of Hungarian arthouse legend Bela Tarr, who is an executive producer along with Rapace. Jóhannsson co-wrote the script with mononymic Icelandic writer Sjón, a frequent collaborator of Björk, which accounts for the film’s lyrical, often opaque tone and folkloric feel. Lamb is a film which operates by its own rules and trusts the audience to be able to grasp what they are with minimal handholding. Perhaps it trusts us too much; you may find yourself wondering where all this is going more than once.
Yet there is beauty to be found here, and mystery. Lamb’s refusal to explicitly define the supernatural elements in play means that they remain uncanny throughout, retaining their power to unsettle right through to the film’s closing moments. Rapace and Guðnason excel at communicating the interiority of their characters with minimal dialogue, letting wordless glances and quiet, shared moments say so much. The loneliness of the setting is palpable, the mood both oppressive and haunting, and cinematographer Eli Arenson gives us some genuinely striking and unsettling imagery.

But what does it all add up to? Not as much as it wants to, I’m afraid: Lamb is less than the sum of its parts. While it could be argued that the unsolved enigmas it presents are a feature rather than a bug, coming away from the film, it’s hard not to arrive at the conclusion that we haven’t been given all the pieces we need to at least get a sense of the whole picture. As a tone poem Lamb works a treat, but unless you’re willing to give yourself over completely, odds are good you’ll be more frustrated than entranced."
49,RSR_Doc9_Lamb,RSR,Horror,Negative,Lamb,"ear is relative. When it comes to horror as a genre, what scares some might not scare all. And between the marketing strategy and October release date for A24’s latest, ""Lamb,"" it would be natural to assume that this is a horror film meant to take advantage of the spooky season. What a disappointment, then, that ""Lamb"" turns out to be a bait and switch. The film is focused on familial loss, transformative grief and the second chances found in children, and all of that can be moving in a particular way. But scares? Few of those are found here. 

To be fair to ""Lamb"" director and co-writer Valdimar Jóhannsson, he describes his latest film as ""a classical drama with genre and surrealist elements."" If A24 hadn’t built an advertising campaign around a flock of sheep as malevolent, vengeful beings, perhaps expectations going into ""Lamb"" wouldn’t be so high. Alas.
There are glimmers in ""Lamb"" of the movie that could have been: one that leaned into folk horror, one that was more explicit in depicting how our fears seem to come to life in the night, or one that presented surrealist elements and asked us not to accept them, but challenge them. Instead, great stretches of ""Lamb"" pass by in which life is lived, but not much else happens. There’s little narrative tension past brief inconveniences that the characters deal with quickly. And although Noomi Rapace (""The Girl with Dragon Tattoo,"" ""Passion""), Hilmir Snær Guðnason (""Polite People"") and Björn Hlynur Haraldsson ground the film emotionally, they seem to exist outside of the film’s attempted dread. Their performances don’t quite match the environment in which the film is enveloping them, and the result is a strangely limp dissonance. 

Perhaps that methodology is meant to lull us into complacency, and into accepting the strangeness on screen, until the film decides that what we’ve come to see as normal can no longer be treated as such. But that pivot happens so quickly, and with so little payoff, that ""Lamb"" ends with frustration rather than fulfillment.
About ‘Lamb’: Silence on a sheep farm

Set in rural Iceland, ""Lamb"" follows married couple María (Rapace) and Ingvar (Guðnason), who run a sheep farm. Months, and maybe even years, pass with them not seeing anyone else in this land where the sun never sets. They treat each other with affectionate concern but also a polite kind of distance. They have their own routines, spend time in separate areas of their home and barely talk during dinner. A tragedy in their past is implied, and a room full of children’s items remains unused. 
Until one day during the lambing season, when María and Ingvar experience something strange. In a scene that captures the subtle facial expressions that Guðnason and Rapace use to build their characters, husband and wife decide to bring a particular lamb home. What happens after that choice drives the remainder of ""Lamb"": the joy María and Ingvar find in their new roles as parents to a creature they name Ada, the unease that Ingvar’s brother Pétur (Haraldsson) brings into their domestic bliss with his unexpected arrival, and the trespass upon their homestead sensed by the family’s dog, but no one else. 
See ‘Lamb’ for: subtle acting and precise, beautiful cinematography
The film is incredibly sparse in dialogue, and so entire scenes are constructed around the trio of actors’ minute reactions to each other and to the mysterious, inexplicable Ada. Some of this is provocative (María’s recurring nightmare of sheep watching her; Pétur initially deadpan reaction to Ada), some of it is legitimately poignant (the tenderness with which Ingvar treats Ada), and most of it is shot with precise beauty by cinematographer Eli Arenson. 
But ""Lamb"" struggles to make clear how much sincerity or acceptance we should apply to what is happening on screen, and the result is both narrative and emotional murkiness. Is this objectively real, or subjectively real to the characters? Should our opinions on those two possibilities differ? ""Lamb"" can’t decide. 
A major difficulty is the film’s failure, until its final moments, to visualize Ada with the same depth and nuance as its human characters. By that point, it’s too little, too late. And while Rapace, in particular, provides some unsettling moments throughout ""Lamb,"" the film’s monotony hampers whatever haunting impact Jóhannsson might have intended. For a horror film befitting Halloween, keep grazing past ""Lamb.""

50,RSR_Doc10_Lamb,RSR,Horror,Negative,Lamb,"The horror-proximate fantasy “Lamb,” which opens Friday in theatres, is the first feature by the Icelandic director Valdimar Jóhannsson (who co-wrote the script with the musician and novelist Sjón), and it plays more like a calling card, a display of professionalism, than an experience. There are only about twenty minutes of its one-and-three-quarter-hour running time that sustain any interest, thanks to a late-breaking twist of industrial-strength cleverness. The narrative trickery that sets up the story—and the sense of a setup is palpable throughout—results in a grossly oversimplified tale that reeks of cynicism. “Lamb” preens and strains to be admired even as it reduces its characters to pieces on a game board and its actors to puppets.
The subject of “Lamb” is a fantasy that’s planted with meticulous yet narrow attention to a realistic context. María (Noomi Rapace) and Ingvar (Hilmir Snær Guðnason) are a young couple on a farm in a remote part of Iceland. They grow crops (most prominently, potatoes) and they raise a few dozen sheep, which live in a barn a short walk across sloping fields from their comfortable and casual little farmhouse. Their workdays involve driving a tractor, leading the sheep through fields, schlepping hay for the sheep to eat, preparing meals, helping sheep give birth, tagging and logging the new arrivals. But their regular routine is disturbed by the barking of their dog near the barn; the couple go in to see what’s up with the sheep, and, looking surprised, note that one of the sheep has given birth without help. Taking the newborn in her arms, María brings it back to the farmhouse, where, wrapped in a blanket, it lives in a metal washtub. They feed it milk with a baby bottle and raise it in the house, dragging a crib from a storage area to a space next to their own bed, where the swaddled lamb will live.
Despite glimpses of the grand, mountainous Icelandic locale and of activities in the house and on the farm, “Lamb” offers virtually no characterization, no inner life, no substance. There’s nothing wrong with a mystery filmed from the outside, in which only observation of the characters elicits clues. But “Lamb” constructs its characters solely as clue generators; their identity is limited to their function. The gap between what the characters know (or, for that matter, who they are) and what they’re shown doing is blatant and frustrating; it makes the movie resemble pages of redacted testimony on which there are more stripes of black ink than legible text. It is, for instance, only a third of the way through the film that the lamb in question is revealed to be actually a hybrid of lamb and human—her head is that of a lamb, and her right arm is a lamb’s furry foreleg, but the rest of her body is humanoid. This fact, known instantly by the couple and weighing on them like some sort of grave matter, is kept a secret from viewers.
María and Ingvar name the ovine girl Ada (pronounced “ahda”), dress her in sweaters and pants, and raise her as their daughter. A few years pass. Ada is now a calm toddler, who walks upright; she doesn’t speak, but she understands what María and Ingvar say. Then the family gets a visitor—Ingvar’s ne’er-do-well brother Pétur (Björn Hlynur Haraldsson), a former rock musician, who is rudely dumped from the trunk of a car onto their property by a trio of people whom María and Ingvar assume are his creditors. María and Ingvar are surprised that Pétur has returned, which is to say that he used to live or visit there; it’s never made clear, but this is in any case the first time he’s been there in years, and thus the first time that he meets Ada. His skepticism about the couple’s decision to raise her takes on an especially bitter and menacing edge, for reasons that are only very belatedly and very thinly suggested to the viewer (but are instantly obvious to all three adults). María and Ingvar fear that Pétur is going to do something to harm Ada or otherwise get rid of her, and this air of fear and menace—combined with Pétur’s efforts to spark an affair with María—drives the drama.
There is nothing anywhere in the film to suggest what María and Ingvar are thinking. For the first ten minutes, they don’t say a word. When they’re shown reading or writing, the substance is neither seen nor heard. When they finally do speak to each other, it’s to exchange banalities. They say nothing of substance about their daily lives or immediate concerns—for instance, not a word to each other about Ada’s unusual form, about any practicalities that it entails, about the significance to them of her presence. Something has been out of whack in the household (hint: the crib in the storage room) but, much as it’s in the forefront of the couple’s minds, even in their activities, the information isn’t dropped in the film until very late, and then only as a virtual onscreen Post-it. (In a prime example of the director’s cagey, shticky way with information, even the protagonists’ names are dropped late into the story.)
Physical labor is dispatched in similarly emblematic ways. Do María and Ingvar sell the sheep? Butcher the sheep? It’s never shown, or even suggested. Their isolation—do they have any friends, any other relatives, any visitors who might also register surprise at Ada’s unusual form? None that are seen, and the story appears to span about five years. Pétur’s skepticism regarding the couple’s raising of Ada is similarly dispatched in a hollow sentence or two. The silences that follow the scant, merely informative dialogue are stupefying silences in which characters are conspicuously turned empty, as if by directorial fiat. Even the movie’s images are stultifyingly retentive, offering information in serenely decorative form and even cutting the best elements—its rare closeups of Ada and of sheep—to merely indicative snippets.
In part, the frustration that “Lamb” elicits is a function of the craft that obviously went into its making. The problem is that all of the evident thought was channelled narrowly into making sure that the story sticks its landing. Far from considering the implications and possibilities opened by its story, the film’s careful organization stifles them. Without any loose ends—and without any conceptual or stylistic audacity behind its sparseness—“Lamb” appears cut off not only from its characters’ inner lives but from the inner life of its creators. Films of humanoid hybrids are having a moment: Julia Ducournau’s “Titane” is also currently in theatres, and the director follows the implications of its fantasy premise to wild extremes; what it lacks in the overt voicing of its characters’ subjectivity it furiously and splendidly makes up for with the director’s own teeming inner worlds and visionary imaginings. “Lamb” reduces fantasy to an excuse and imagination to a product. To my surprise, it won the Prize of Originality in the “Un Certain Regard” section of this year’s Cannes Film Festival. This, and its over-all acclaim, offer a grim view of the state of the art house. If awards it must get, give its twenty twisty minutes an Oscar for Best Live Action Short and be done with it.

51,ZHO_Doc1_SpeedRacer,ZHO,Action,Positive,Speed Racer,"Speed Racer opens with the young boy, Speed, sitting in a classroom, drawing pictures of exploding vehicles, making engine-like noises and fantasizing about driving in a race.
Before we know it, we're in the equivalent of that fantasy, the boy's daydream spread across the big screen with all the technological wizardry Hollywood is capable of.
The first effort from the Wachowski brothers since their The Matrix trilogy, Speed Racer is inspired by the 1960s Japanese anime TV series. And the movie never gets far away from that feeling of a pre-adolescent racetrack daydream.
Speed is the younger brother of Rex, a driver who competes against cars backed by an evil corporation – until he disappears and is presumed dead.
The movie quickly moves ahead to the point where Speed (Emile Hirsch) is now grown up and a race car driver for real, bent on avenging his brother's death.
Against the opposition of his father Pops (John Goodman), who manufactures racing cars with the help of an ace mechanic and who fears another family fatality, Speed enters a brutal cross-country car race and then makes a climactic appearance in the Grand Prix.
Here we have the hoariest of formulae – an innocent opposed by sneering villains in a contest of skill and courage – brought to life with the most technically sophisticated, avant-garde, post-ironic touches.
Such contradictions in the movie abound. This is a futuristic video- game world in which Speed's mother (Susan Sarandon), known only as Mom, still makes pancakes for her family's breakfast and uses her woman's touch to calm down Pops.
(The movie does nod to feminism when Speed's girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci) takes over the wheel for a brief time.)
Technology in this world may advance, but a young man still has to prove he's a man. Speed gets conflicting advice in this regard. Royalton, the corporate genius (Roger Allam) tells him, ""Are you ready to put away your toys and grow up?"" By toys he presumably means comic books, video games, racing cars and even movies like Speed Racer.
Pops, on the other hand, seems to think his son can keeps his toys as long as he uses them properly.
""I saw my son become a man,"" he proclaims at the end of the movie. ""I saw him act with courage and integrity and drive the pants off all the other racers on the road.""
Lest anybody think racing is just an amusement for the masses, Speed tells Royalton, ""For Pops, it isn't just a sport, it's way more important than that. It's like a religion. In our house major sponsors are like the devil.""
If religion isn't a serious enough comparison, how about art?
""I go to the races to watch you make art,"" Mom tells Speed. ""And it's beautiful and inspiring and everything that art should be.""
There is no necessity for anybody to take this seriously. More interesting is what on earth the Wachowski brothers are up to with this bombardment of the viewer's eardrums and retinas with noises, colours and lights. The racing sequences are almost unwatchable at times, like a flickering series of subliminal stimuli.
The colours are certainly gorgeous, right down to the bright red lipstick of the women. The flashing blues, reds and yellows are reminiscent of the interiors of gambling casinos. Like these interiors, the movie is totally cut off from the ""real"" world. We see mountains and deserts during the cross-country race, but they are clearly CGI products with comic book touches added, such as a vulture perched on a peak. We see the spires and towers of a futuristic city, but we have no idea of the time and place of this film.
What is completely familiar is the overwhelming impression of speed. It's not just the racing cars. ""Our vertically integrated plant is the fastest in the world,"" boasts Royalton.
In its complete artificiality, its embrace of cartoon images, its abolition of distance and perspective through constant, instantaneous movement, the movie seems poised to say something about the world we live in. It seems about to reflect back to us our actual experience. It seems to suggest we are all speed racers.
The movie, unfortunately, doesn't make that leap from sensation to art, but it suggests fascinating possibilities for moviemakers interested in using the latest techniques seriously to explore the world – the fairyland we have made with our technology.

52,ZHO_Doc2_SpeedRacer,ZHO,Action,Positive,Speed Racer,"When I first saw this with my Very hard to please grandparent, I was 10 and look likely like my profile pic. The experience is one I only remember as uncomfortable, but particularly for things like the kid flipping the bad guy off. A moment I love rewatching now as its one of the few tonal shifts that really lands. But I have severe social anxiety, and so I didn't even really watch the movie as a kid, I just survived through it. But on rewatching it as randomly remembered it two years a go, specifically cause I wanted to see how bad it would hold up especially given my first impression. Yeah, Then I actually watched the movie, and the whole time I couldn't stop finding things I love about it. Its overly cheesy but that kind of gives it charm, except that kid ughhh. Not the worst, but he was this movies Jar Jar. Really, please give this movie a try and specifically actively Try to not enjoy it. I promise, within the first 15 minutes you'll get what I'm saying, and by 45 you won't be capable of turning it off. Or maybe this will be relatable, remember when you were a kid and you played with cars and planes with stupid crazy physics and impossible drifting that just made it cooler? Yeah, this movie is that experience you had as a kid except in a somewhat silly but generally fun lighthearted movie rather defined by its surprisingly good cinematography, stylistic choices, and what CGI they had at the time. And yes, where its not so hot as some scenes literally look like they stole some Cat in the Hat background CGI, but again, at least for me it kinda makes it more fun to watch. It's a look back at my past, like playing on a gameboy without a backlight and finding that amusing even though that's an inconvenience, why would you feel happy to not have something? We just like and need to reflect on our past to enjoy the present. Really, it is a good bad movie, except after prob 14~15 watches in 2 years I can tell you it's one that gets way more good than bad, and the main flaw is really just that you need multiple watches to really understand what's important and even happening at times, as a kid all I remember is CGI overload and there were races :'}. But rather controversially, I actually think the simplicity and universality of the patht the movie follow, and why the protagonist does what he does, though void of much tangibile character change, His goal of essentially just doing what you love, not caring what people think about you because of it, and even fighting through a broken system rigged against you to win. And when he wins, man its like the characters, while simple, gave the ability to really embody the IDEA of a mother or father, the Meme or architype, all the same in the end, and the bad guy is that guy whos your boss's boss's boss's and he's actually legitimately evil. So this rare very genuine feeling mass applicability and appeal this movie has really has me stunned as to why it was forgotten so quickly. No its not perfect, doesn't mean I'm not gonna watch it just cause I'm thinking about it. See ya!

53,ZHO_Doc3_SpeedRacer,ZHO,Action,Positive,Speed Racer,"Watching ""Speed Racer,"" the new summer lollapalooza from the Wachowski brothers, is like being force-fed a Costco-size bag of your favorite candy. For half an hour, taste buds you didn't know you had are firing in delirium, stoked by the movie's outrageous visual razzle-dazzle. Then you hit that spot in the bag where you know you should stop, but the movie keeps going. You feel more and more bloated; the movie keeps going. At a certain point, you may wonder if the movie's eating you. It doesn't end so much as vomit the audience out. That's entertainment, I suppose, or an experience, or a night out at the movies on acid. In ""Speed Racer,"" millions of dollars and billions of computer cycles have been expended creating a digital wonder-world simulacrum - an unimaginably amped-up, CGI-enhanced live action version of the beloved 1960s Japanese anime many of us remember from US airings on upper-dial broadcast and cable stations (Channel 56 in Boston for me, a half-eaten Space Stick in my hand).
The show, created by Tatsuo Yoshida, was in the mold of Osamu Tezuka's groundbreaking ""Astro Boy"": flat, fast, catchy, hilariously dubbed in all italics. Boy car-fanatic Speed Racer drove his Mach 5 against colorful opponents with hidden tire-knives, while girlfriend Trixie, parents Pops and Mom, little brother Spritle, and their pet chimp Chim-Chim screeched and swooned in the stands. Wonderful at 4 in the afternoon when you should be doing homework, but is there a movie in it?
The Wachowskis - still trying to match ""The Matrix"" - respond by building a universe out of pixels and aiming for a massive sugar high. The skies are a cobalt digital blue here, the clouds on loan from Teletubbyland. The racetracks, blissfully, defy all engineering logic, and the cars flip and careen with 800-horsepower abandon (producer Joel Silver has dubbed the action sequences ""Car Fu""). The time period is the 1960s seen through the nostalgic GAF View-Master of a 21st century graphic designer - it's future retro. The sensibility is Hot Wheels on industrial steroids. My inner 7-year-old was having atrial fibrillations.
There are people here, sort of. ""Speed Racer"" drops human actors into its breathless visual schema like drops of water on a hot griddle: Emile Hirsch as Speed, Christina Ricci as Trixie, Susan Sarandon and John Goodman as Mom and Pops. Hirsch is appropriately wooden - any trace of his ""Into the Wild"" passion has been sandblasted off - and Ricci appears to have lost more than 50 percent of her body weight; she's all chin and mischievous saucer-eyes. The movie's the wayward grandchild of ""Tron,"" the 1982 Disney film that doodled primitive computer graphics over actors like Jeff Bridges.
The intentionally banal plot barely merits a mention, but here goes: Speed resists the enticements of a swishy, omnipotent tycoon (Roger Allam, channeling late-period Tim Curry) and schemes to expose him with the help of the not-so-mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox of ""Lost,"" looking dandy in his bondage mask), Japanese racer Taejo (Rain), and the dauntless Inspector Detector (Benno Fürmann). It's a corporate power fantasy about the evils of corporate power, basically; an irony the filmmakers flatten in their race to the finish.
""Speed Racer"" screeches to a halt every so often for boilerplate inspirational speeches - reprised toward the end in a goofy, greatest-hits montage - and for cutesy slapstick involving Spritle (Paulie Litt) and the chimpanzees playing Chim-Chim (less amusing if you credit rumors of animal abuse on the German shooting locations).
Mostly, the Wachowskis rev the movie's motor in geometrically increasing RPMs, building inexorably to a climax that can only be described as NASCAR Zen orgasm. Aiming to replicate the experience of the anime on a metastasized scale, ""Speed Racer"" unsnaps the characters from the frame and lets them deliver their lines on floating multiple planes of action, constantly wiping this way and that like cars playing chicken on a crowded freeway. It's enthralling, and then it's exhausting, and it never lets up.
On the levels of technical craftsmanship and pure eye-candy, ""Speed Racer"" is some kind of triumph of the will. It has a knowing foot in pop art as well - the movie could be a Roy Lichtenstein canvas using pixels instead of zipatone dots. It's also thunderingly, proudly empty in a way that prompts either total submission or thoughts of resistance. The movie demands you be a glutton for sensation and then has the nerve to ask why you're not hungrier.

54,ZHO_Doc4_SpeedRacer,ZHO,Action,Positive,Speed Racer,"The narrowing line between live action and animation is obliterated spectacularly in ""Speed Racer,"" the Wachowski Brothers (""The Matrix"") eyepopping update of the 1960s manga and anime TV series created by Tatsuo Yoshida. The Wachowskis have whipped up a 136-minute silly symphony of fluorescent colors, gravity-defying car races and cartoonish villains, all served up in a fluid, dreamlike style as sophisticated as the storyline is aggressively childish. This is a movie aimed squarely at the family audience—if the characters' names Mom Racer and Pop Racer (John Goodman and Susan Sarandon) weren't tip-off enough, the scene-stealing pet chimp should give you fair warning.
 
The gifted race-car driver Speed (Emile Hirsch, looking almost as lean as he did in ""Into the Wild,"" but more clean-cut) is the pure sportsman in a corrupt world of fixed races, dirty drivers (whose cars come equipped with lethal weapons) and multimillion-dollar corporate sponsors. It's a sign of Speed's purity that he turns down a sponsorship offer from the ruthless, money-worshiping head of Royalton Industries (Roger Allam), who responds to this rebuff by threatening to ruin both Speed and his family's proudly independent Racing Motors company. Lest there be any doubt that the ""Matrix"" creators, former indie filmmakers working in the heart of the studio system, see this as a parable of their own careers, Mom Racer tells her talented son, ""You're an artist … What you do is beautiful and inspiring.""
 
""Speed Racer"" creates a timeless, visually seductive world suspended somewhere between the pop '60s and the sci-fi future. Its biggest disappointment, strangely enough, is its raison d'être--the races themselves. They lack suspense. The danger of creating a videogame world, where the limitless freedom of CGI replaces the laws of physics, is that the competitions lack any real sense of risk. These flying, flipping racing cars, seemingly impervious to metal-crunching collisions, belong more to the world of Tom and Jerry or the Road Runner than they do to ""The French Connection"" or ""Bullitt."" (Even the races in Pixar's ""Cars"" seemed more down to earth.) ""Speed Racer"" is sweet and flashy and often fun, but its thrills are oddly abstract—more esthetic than visceral. It's the colors you remember, not the crashes.
Curiously enough, David Mamet's ""Redbelt"" tells exactly the same story as ""Speed Racer,"" albeit in a style that couldn't be more different. His hero, Mike Terry (Chiwetel Ejiofor), is another sportsman of unshakable principles, a teacher of Brazilian jiujitsu forced to confront a corrupt world of fixed fights and money-grubbing mixed-martial-arts promoters. Instead of CGI, Mamet prefers hand-to-hand combat and the sharp chop of his trademark macho dialogue. But his vision of the pure and the good is not far removed from ""Speed Racer""'s anticorporate (and corporate-sponsored) message. Like Speed, Mike is Mamet's portrait of the artist battling for his integrity in a fallen world. The writer-director overloads his tricky plot with backstabbing Hollywood skullduggery—his hero is lured into the movie world when he saves the skin of a movie star (Tim Allen) in a bar fight—creating mysteries that never get satisfyingly explained in his surprisingly Hollywoodish third act. But thanks to Ejiofor's wonderful performance--his easy, commanding body language wordlessly convinces you of his character's nobility—and Mamet's knowing take on the arcane world of Brazilian jiujitsu, ""Redbelt"" never loses its muscular hold on your attention.

55,ZHO_Doc5_SpeedRacer,ZHO,Action,Positive,Speed Racer,"Speed Racer offers a crazy, turbo-charged mix of cartoon kitsch, gamer action, and a wild new way to think of - and look at - movies. But like a kid who's had totally too much candy (and there's one in Speed Racer), inevitably a crash is involved. Not just a wheel-spinning pileup on the track, but the kind of physical and mental collapse that comes from two-hours-plus exposure to kaleidoscopic digital imagery, zooming motorway mayhem, and dialogue that's all snap, crackle and cool.
Based on the 1960s Japanese animated TV series, and brought to the screen in a primary-colors splash of live-action, CG, and green-screen effects by Andy and Larry Wachowski - in their first directing job since 2003's Matrix sequels - Speed Racer makes absolutely no effort to root itself in the real world.
Instead, the universe of Speed Racer offers futuro cityscapes and neon-limned architecture, and race arenas that look like Las Vegas gone wild.
Meanwhile, the suburban homestead of the Racer clan - Speed (Emile Hirsch), little brother Spritle (Paulie Litt), Mom (Susan Sarandon), and Dad (John Goodman) - is a populuxe pastiche of midcentury modern and 21st-century tech, with a paint chart that'll blow your head off.
I can't imagine what this thing does to your retinas in Imax - and Speed Racer opens on close to 100 such mega-format screens (including UA King of Prussia, locally).
Hirsch - last seen in the 180-degrees different Into the Wild - plays the talented young driver haunted by the memory of his older brother, Rex, a racing champ who went down in a blaze of crumpled metal and scandal. With the support of his parents (a father who designs race cars, a mother who makes PB&Js), the eager encouragement of his pipsqueak sibling and a pet chimp, and an assist or two from a trusty Aussie mechanic (Kick Gurry), Speed takes to the track, shunning a lucrative sponsorship deal from the yellow-toothed tycoon E.P. Arnold Royalton (Roger Allam).
While Royalton plots and schemes to defeat and humiliate Speed, Speed's girlfriend, Trixie (Christina Ricci), provides counsel - and go-get-'em grins and modelistic poses. And then there's Racer X (Matthew Fox), a masked figure who gives guru sound bites. For example: ""You don't climb into a T-180 to be a driver. You do it because you're driven.""
In a nod to its origins, Speed Racer features a punky Japanese rival driver played by the Asian pop star Rain, his dishy girlfriend Horuko (Yu Nan), an Asian industrialist (Hiroyuki Sanada), and a nifty ninja kickfest - one of the few action set pieces that don't involve careening down the track, or defying the G-forces in a cross-country car rally.
The brothers Wachowski are at their inventive best spinning narrative details with stop-and-start montages - there's an explanation of the identity of Racer X near movie's end that works with the economy and visual dazzle of a classic silent-screen sequence. And there's really no ""acting"" to speak of in Speed Racer - it's more like mugging for the camera, a steering wheel prop in hand, with the knowledge that several thousand digital renderers will fill in the blanks. But Hirsch manages to convey some angst (""I'm caught in a tailspin - I'm so confused right now"") as he turns his head in profile, his modified Elvis pompadour about to be encased by the crash helmet with the big M on it. That's for Mifune Motors, by the way, from the original Japanese 'toon.

56,ZHO_Doc6_SpeedRacer,ZHO,Action,Negative,Speed Racer,"MAYBE every generation gets its own “Tron.”
“Speed Racer” comes to us from the creators of “The Matrix,” and as my cerebral cortex was reeling from the onslaught of its jelly-belly colors and “Lucy in the Sky” graphics, I wondered if there was some parallel universe where it might be considered an entertaining experience. Maybe Japan?
This adventurously awful film is awful in many ways at once.
It is, like a Ferrari poking across East 42nd Street at rush hour, fast yet slow. It is futuristically retro. Its attention span is measurable in microseconds, yet it runs more than two hours. And it spent a trillion dollars imitating the look of a 10-cent cartoon from the primitive ’60s – artistically, the Cro-Magnon era. I was initially awed by its splendors. But when I’d had my fill, there was still an hour-45 left.
Not to whine, but by the end, my eyeballs were on fire.
Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch of “Into the Wild”) comes from a family with a large carbon footprint. His dad, Pops (John Goodman), makes fast cars, assisted by Mom (Susan Sarandon). His older brother, a champion driver himself, dies young. Perhaps he couldn’t bear living a moment longer knowing that – with the last name Racer and parents who were willing to use Speed as a given name – they saved it for the next kid and stuck him with “Rex.”
Vowing to carry on Rex Racer’s Earnhardt-esque legacy, Speed hits the racetrack in the opening minutes for a zoomy action scene in which he has a chance to break his brother’s records. Much like the other big set pieces in the movie, the race blasts colors and shapes all over the screen. This could well be the most dazzling thing you’ve ever seen – or it could make you long for the relative serenity of Saturday night at the disco. Either way, it’s hard to stay interested when the race keeps breaking off into flashbacks.
This movie’s motto is cut to the exposition – or the monkey. Speed Racer has a little brother at home who is prone to getting in “comical” situations. I fence the word between quotation marks because the film does. No one is likely to laugh at the squirt as he (for instance) is awed by the sight of a candy display or attacks a ninja by adhering to his calf.
Every time we check in on the scampering of the l’il tyke and his pet chimp – 20 minutes could have been saved by eliminating them – the racing thrills seem diminished by the jokey context. The Wachowski brothers call their movie motorized kung fu – “car fu” – but the monkey makes it more like Jar Jar Fu. This is the costliest piece of camp ever manufactured.
Speed is offered a sponsorship by an evil CEO from the Royalton Corp., who uses his stable of talent in a scheme to fix races that affects the price of oil. The CEO spends about 10 minutes explaining this in a scene that has all the narrative pull of the commodities pricing chart in the Financial Times.
Instead of joining the dark side, Speed joins forces with his girlfriend (Christina Ricci) and former rivals Taejo (played by the Korean pop star Rain) and Racer X, a character who has the misfortune to be played by the monotonous Matthew Fox. He’s costumed in one of the shoddiest outfits modeled by a comic-book type since the Riddler pranced around the 1960s “Batman” TV show in green polyester pajamas with question marks printed on them. Racer X, whose true identity is shrouded, looks like a crossing guard at a school for dorks.
The racers set off on a cross-country rally against cheating rivals who try to harpoon Speed’s tires or send him skittering off an icy cliff. But each time Speed has an answer: He pushes a button, and the car sprouts shields out of its hubcaps or drops its wounded tires and instantly inflates new ones.
Spectacular as this sequence is, with awesome digital landscapes ranging from desert to Brandenburg Gate, it’s basically a video game fed by hyperactivity instead of interactivity. The movie makes you crave a streamlined story, interesting characters and a joystick.
"
57,ZHO_Doc7_SpeedRacer,ZHO,Action,Negative,Speed Racer,"""Speed Racer"" is not just the latest blockbuster. It's the latest thing in blockbusters. The Wachowski brothers (""The Matrix"") fill the movie with so many new ideas about how to make pictures that it soon becomes fun just to watch those ideas whiz by, even the bad ones. All the same, if this action extravaganza represents the future of movies, it's going to be a sad, dead and awful future.
The proposition at work here is whether it's possible to make a movie almost entirely out of flash, commotion and bursts of color. The Wachowskis don't come close to proving it, but they try harder than anyone has ever tried. They take some empty source material - a visually stilted, emotionally stunted cartoon from a generation ago - and stuff it with the best actors they can get and the splashiest effects they can devise. They turn actors into puppets and cinema into a video game. It's ghastly, but they do it on a grand scale.
The fact is, like the toxic gas suspended over a northern New Jersey sunrise, poison can be beautiful. It's gorgeous here: The live action is fed through some computer process, so that every visual pops out. Red is the dominant color, but not just red, but a candy apple red that's so bright and vivid, it all but jumps off the screen and sits in your lap. In an early scene, the young Speed rides in a car with his older brother. The upholstery is red, and the sky is a mix of unearthly dark blue sky and white clouds. It's so pretty that for a minute, it doesn't matter what they're saying. The experience is like walking into your first carnival.
This can't last, but the opening shows what the Wachowskis wanted to do, not for a minute, but for a whole movie: to pound the audience into a delighted stupor. To give people a bacchanalian feast of sights and sounds, with a mere handful of straight scenes for audiences to purge their senses in preparation for the next orgy. Ultimately, the experiment fails, in that the experience becomes numbing, not energizing. But when a movie can make even a bottle of peanut butter look beautiful - and when whole sequences feel like you just put on new glasses after years of being nearsighted - that's something.
Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) is a racing prodigy with a tight family, a mom played by Susan Sarandon and a dad played by John Goodman, not to mention a little brother with a chimpanzee. Speed has a big-eyed girlfriend named Trixie (Christina Ricci), and the sight of Ricci trying to emulate the mannerisms of a cartoon character is one of the more disturbing things in movies this year. That she does it well - Ricci does everything well - makes it only worse. What a constrained and dreadful conformity for a vibrant and eccentric talent.
The central conflict of ""Speed Racer"" is that a corrupt, billionaire tycoon, Royalton (Roger Allam), wants Speed to race for him. Speed won't do it, and so the tycoon sets out to destroy Speed and his family. Speed's only recourse is to work his magic on the racetrack, and so there are lots of racing scenes. Lots and lots and lots of racing scenes. Cars fly, flip, drive up the side of icy mountains, do cartwheels and burst into flames. These scenes come close to straight-up animation, but they're more like watching a video game - not like playing a video game, but like watching other people play, and for a very long time.
There's a scene in which one car's tire has a sword and another car's tire has a shield, and the two tires duel, as the cars race down a mountain road. If that sounds entertaining, boy have I got a movie for you.
Along the way, the Wachowskis come up with new things. In one sequence, several drivers are talking to each other as they race. Rather than cut to each of them, the Wachowskis more or less lift them from the background into the foreground, as though maximizing a computer window each time one speaks. That's an ugly technique, but something else, similar, is much better: Instead of cutting to people commenting on the action, they sometimes just show their heads floating across the screen as they speak. At one point, several heads crowd the frame, each making comments, all of them voices in Speed's head, intruding on his peace. It's not a bad way to convey that idea.
Yet in the end, most of what the Wachowskis devise is used to ill effect. Who needs to see an actor standing at the center of a blue screen, with stands of animated fans cheering in his direction? That looks as fake as old-time rear projection, and in about 15 minutes, it will seem just as old-fashioned, too.
There's a scene in which Speed's mother (Sarandon) comforts him by saying that what he does ""behind the wheel has nothing to do with business,"" but that he's truly an artist. The irony is that every actor in this movie is just collecting a check. Speed may be all about art, but ""Speed Racer"" is all about commerce.
Yet someday, real artists may come along to use some of the techniques that the Wachowskis are developing. Then things will get interesting.

58,ZHO_Doc8_SpeedRacer,ZHO,Action,Negative,Speed Racer,"After the debacle of the Matrix trilogy - in the final third of which the directors' reputations declined exponentially, like a batting collapse in English cricket - the Wachowski brothers are back. But their minds are clearly more frazzled than ever. The deafeningly loud and stroboscopically flashy film they have brought us is a feature-length version of the Japanese anime series about a super-fast racecar driver called Speed Racer. That is: his first name is Speed and his surname is Racer; Speed is what Mr and Mrs Racer have called him and it does not appear to be a nickname. His elder brother's first name is merely Rex, which appears to indicate that his parents believed that racing was the younger sibling's destiny.
Anyway, Emile Hirsch, an actor with a kind of young Elvis beauty, plays Speed, who races in the weird and wonderful sci-fi arenas in this Japanimated alternative-reality world, the cars clattering and careening madly around, often in the diagonal ""Tokyo Drift"" style, sometimes achieving vertical takeoff, sometimes apparently able to whizz straight through other cars like ghosts. Roger Allam plays Royalton, the evil corporate bully who wants to crush indie-minded racers such as Speed and his mechanic dad Pops (John Goodman). Christina Ricci plays girlfriend Trixie, with whom Speed has a weirdly platonic, almost sibling relationship, and Matthew Fox, from TV's interminable Lost, plays the mysterious masked Racer X. Speed also has a tyke-ish kid brother, who in turn has a pet chimp; they are both so irritating I wanted to tie them to the track and run them over in the nearest Ferrari.
Everything takes place in a cartoony, Day-Glo, digitised universe, with all the actors performing in front of a green-screen. The oranges and blues and greens and reds are too intense, as if on an old-fashioned television with the contrast dial turned up too high. It's like watching a 3-D movie without the 3-D glasses, and this in fact is the kids'-TV visual style that Robert Rodriguez once experimented with in his Spy Kids period.
It's often baffling. Some of the actors are Australian. Roger Allam's character, though an evil Brit, appears also to be German. Go figure. It's also occasionally intriguing in an exotic and bizarre way, though the speed scenes don't have the mad chutzpah of the contra-flow highway chase sequence from Matrix Reloaded. There is a very dreamy moment in which the cars seem to attempt a massive loop-the-loop section of track, which is suddenly viewed as it were in long-shot, with the distant metal ring surreally juxtaposed with a stately flamingo.
Sometimes it's strange in an, erm, not-good way. Christina Ricci's face in this movie has an unearthly quality, as if the Wachowskis have found some way of disassembling every molecule of her body and reformulating it as digital pixels. Her skin looks like a pioneering bio-plastic mix being produced somewhere on the Planet Zog.
You have to be 12 to like it, and I have to say there is little or nothing here to remind us why we were all quite so excited about The Matrix. But there's nothing to rule out Andy and Larry Wachowski returning in the future with something to astound us once more.
"
59,ZHO_Doc9_SpeedRacer,ZHO,Action,Negative,Speed Racer,"Wachowski Brothers' movie tries for a family-values focus but veers into frenetic, sometimes cheesy effects.
Don't see the new Wachowski Brothers movie ""Speed Racer"" if your memories of that '60s Japanese cartoon show are less than fond. Also don't see it if you'd rather play a video game than be trapped inside one. And don't go expecting a ""Matrix""-style experience.
Maybe that last warning is not quite accurate. The Wachowskis, of course, were the masterminds behind the ""Matrix"" trilogy and, try as they might to reverse course and make a candy-colored family-entertainment lalapalooza, they're still courting nightmarishness. ""Speed Racer"" is so garishly straightlaced that it's positively surreal.
I was not one of those boomers who spent my dewy years parked in front of the TV screen shouting, ""Go, Speed Racer, go!"" I would like to think that this defect in my upbringing does not disqualify me from passing judgment on a movie that certainly does not need my help on its run to riches.
But the last time I checked, a family entertainment movie was supposed to entertain the entire family. For the sake of their kids, most parents have learned to endure the pap that passes for family fare these days, but the 135-minute ""Speed Racer"" may have set the bar on what parents can endure.
The irony is that ""Speed Racer"" prides itself on being a movie about bedrock family values. The family that races together stays together – sort of. And the Racer family lives and dies for racing. Pops (John Goodman) is a race-car designer, and his two eldest sons, Rex (Scott Porter) and Speed (Emile Hirsch), are demons on the track. Another son, the pipsqueak Spritle (Paulie Litt, who looks like Goodman's Mini-Me), cheers them on. Even their obstreperous pet chimp Chim-Chim gets in on the act. (Can a chimp be a ham?) Mom (Susan Sarandon) is the calming influence holding everything together.
When a big bad racing tycoon (Roger Allam, resembling a cross between Christopher Hitchens and Al Gore), tries to snare Speed's talents and is rebuffed, the Day-Glo movie suddenly gets all moralistic. Speed goes it alone, the little guy who refuses to knuckle under to corporate interests.
This is a rather odd message coming from a big-studio Hollywood movie designed to kick off a $1 billion franchise. What's even odder is that the Wachowskis think their bug-eyed Grand Prix hoo-ha functions as a fable about the importance of family. For that to be the case, you'd have to accept the Racers as something more than a gaggle of human-scaled cartoon characters. The Wachowskis are reaching for ""heart"" in this movie – a quality that was noticeably AWOL in the ""Matrix"" movies – but their own hearts aren't in it. They're too wound up by the new Sony F-23 HD cameras and the (sometimes cheesy) CGI effects.
""Speed Racer"" is so hyperfrenetic that, in the end, you wonder if the Wachowskis aren't trying to pull off an elaborate hoax – a deranged techno fantasia posing as retro-ish family fare. Grade: C- (Rated PG, for sequences of action, some violence and language.)
"
60,ZHO_Doc10_SpeedRacer,ZHO,Action,Negative,Speed Racer,"Evil is not a primary color. That is the point of the Wachowski brothers' video-arcade treatment of ""Speed Racer,"" insofar as one can be determined. Blue, you can trust. Red and yellow, black and white -- they're all decent visible wavelengths. It's purple you have to watch out for.
This is notable only because whatever information that passes from your retinas to your brain during ""Speed Racer"" is conveyed through optical design and not so much through more traditional devices such as dialogue, narrative, performance or characterization. Like the animated TV series that inspired this movie, you could look at it with the sound off and it wouldn't matter.
""Speed Racer"" is not a feature film in any conventional sense -- although there is nothing so conventional in today's marketplace as a corporate product based on a campy vintage TV show that is developed for extremely brief exhibition in multiplexes on its way to more appropriate platforms such as DVD and video games, which provide the principal justification for its manufacture in the first place.
Neither is ""Speed Racer"" a commercial avant-garde film (though fans of the Wachowski brothers may wish to make such claims), unless you still consider Laserium shows of Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"" to be cutting edge. (Lights! Shapes! Colors! Motion! Money!) And there's nothing terribly adventurous these days about Eisensteinian montage treated as if it were William S. Burroughs' ""cut up"" technique -- with digital clips randomly scrambled like pixelated confetti.
Nor is it some kind of subversive commodity, unless the outré strategy of pandering to a low-brow, retro-nostalgic crowd can be considered anything but business as usual in 2008. The faux naivete on display here -- right down to the imitation-fruit-flavored FDA-food-dye coloring -- is both shamelessly quaint and shamelessly cynical.
For a certain generation of American kids, ""Speed Racer"" was our introduction to the lo-fi animated form now known as ""anime."" At the time, we just thought it was cheapo Japanese animation: flat, static, dubbed into badly translated English and barely ""animated"" at all, given that the frame only seemed to change approximately two times per second and the ""moving"" backgrounds were made up of about four cyclically repeating drawings instead of the eight or so we were used to seeing in Hanna-Barbera cartoons. The faster Speed went, the slower the sequence of backgrounds. Wow.
To us, this show was just filler between after-school reruns of ""Gilligan's Island"" and ""The Munsters."" We watched it because it was on, and it was in color.
Now the Wachowski brothers (of the ""Matrix"" movies) have spent $100 million on a mixture of photography and digital animation and called it ""Speed Racer."" They have captured (almost) all the chintziness, inexpressiveness and incoherence of the TV show in two hours and nine minutes, or about two hours too long, give or take. Yet some of us would just rather re-rent ""Tron"" (1982), which was not only a more immersive, dimensional and original take on the Commodore 64 video-graphics aesthetic, but also funnier and more exciting.
The live-action components of ""Speed Racer"" include Speed himself (Emile Hirsch, consigned to anonymity again after a breakout performance in ""Into the Wild""), who lives with his Mom (Susan Sarandon), Pops (John Goodman), mischievous little brother Spritle (Paulie Litt), pet chimp Chim-Chim (Kenzie and Willy) -- as well as, apparently, his mechanic Sparky (Kick Gurry) and his gal-pal Trixie (Christina Ricci). They all love Mom's pancakes.
Speed once idolized his big brother Rex Racer (Scott Porter), who died in a fiery car crash as idolized big brothers named ""Racer"" will sometimes do. Rich, evil, purple-clad industrialist Mr. Royalton (Roger Allam, as Tim Curry) woos Speed with a lucrative offer, but when the hotshot turns it down in favor of sticking with Pops, Royalton threatens to destroy all Racers. Fortunately, the mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox, displaying fewer emotions than Jack on ""Lost"") zips in to help out.
As an elementary schooler, Speed is afflicted with foot-tapping hyperactivity and ADD, and so is the movie. A lot of fluorescent, 7-Eleven-tinted images flash by, any of which could easily be removed or re-arranged without significantly disrupting the film's continuity, because it has none. If you can determine the spatial relationship between Speed's Mach 5 (or Mach 6) and any other race car for more than a few consecutive seconds, then good for you. As on the TV series, the pictures don't seem to move so much as repeat -- movement with no momentum. Transitions are handled with wipes in which large closeups pass from one side of the screen to the other without ever getting anyone anywhere.
If non-pixel illumination was used in the (mostly green-screen) shooting of the movie at all, it appears to have been black light, which gives everything a phosphorescent, psychedelic-poster sheen. At various times, the visuals resemble ""Blade Runner"" reinterpreted by Roger Dean (of Yes album cover fame), ""The Jetsons"" rendered by Maxfield Parrish, or a bag of Skittles designed by Shag.
""Speed Racer"" is a manufactured widget, a packaged commodity that capitalizes on an anthropomorphized cartoon of Capitalist Evil in order to sell itself and its ancillary products. Corporate partners in the venture include General Mills, McDonald's, Mattel, Topps, LEGO and Target, who have furnished no promotional consideration for mention in this review.

61,DOE_Doc1_Cruella,DOE,Comedy,Positive,Cruella,"Of all the Disney villains in history, there are none quite so devious as Cruella De Vil. Royal traitors like Jafar and Scar take the prize for most ambitious, but there’s a particular black heartedness to planning the murder of a hundred adorable puppies simply for something nice to wear. A coat which, by all accounts, Cruella would have likely forgotten about or thrown out the moment she was tired of it. 

So she threw it out? The coat made of my children? Okay.
There’s no sin more original than that, so it’s easy to understand why you’d want to make a movie about that person. Why ‘Cruella’ decides to tell the story about such a villain with a sympathetic view? Your guess is as good as mine. Still, that’s the tale that is told in the live action ‘Cruella’ in which Emma Stone plays a relatable young fashion designer with a bit of a mean streak.

Early in the movie Cruella’s life as a young girl named Estella, shows that mean streak in its infancy. She’s hot tempered and will get herself into trouble as naturally as a dalmatian wears its spots. Rarely though is her bad action unfounded. Her methods are extreme but the film always roots her reaction in empathy. Cruella is a protagonist you can easily get behind, especially given her storied past.

Soon after, Estella becomes Cruella proper, and unfolds the mystery of her past, while making an explosive entry into the London fashion scene. Standing in her way is Emma Thompson’s The Baroness. Whereas the Cruella we all know and love would announce her presence by storming into a room and shouting at the top of her lungs, the Baroness has a much more somber approach, while being just as soul crushing. Think Miranda Priestly meets Nurse Ratched, and throw in a british accent for good measure. It’s a combination that’s riveting to watch, especially when the two Emmas go head to head. Not to mention their punk rock accompaniment, as the film puts its 1970s setting to good use with an fun and energetic soundtrack.  

The revenge story of the decade in ‘Love Actually 2: Both Sides Now’
Their battle of wits plays out with some delicious verbal sparring, and their performances deserve acclaim. Still, the real heavy hitter in this film is Academy Award winning costume designer Jenny Beavan, whose previous work includes ‘Mad Max: Fury Road’. The sheer volume of outfits worn by Stone and the rest of the cast, is matched only by the level of detail on each. The designs are the subject of some of the films most iconic shots, like when Cruella is carried off by a garbage truck and the 40 foot train of her dress, made entirely out of discarded clothing, follows behind her. 

Visually, ‘Cruella’ is striking and impressive. It helps to keep you engaged with the film, especially when its more distracting elements emerge. The film’s cg visual effects are perhaps the most egregious. Cruella has two canine companions that are unfortunately not as polished as the rest of the film and stand out in the worst way. For a film series that owes its entire existence to dogs, you’d think they would at least do them justice on the big screen. "
62,DOE_Doc2_Cruella,DOE,Comedy,Positive,Cruella,"As candidates for image rehab go, 101 Dalmatians' Cruella de Vil poses a particularly vexing challenge. The lady is most famous for trying to make coats out of stolen puppies — vile stuff even by villain standards, and difficult to explain away. So the new Cruella hardly bothers to try, choosing instead to tiptoe around it in killer stilettos.

Cruella, a character once memorialized in song as ""an inhuman beast,"" is reimagined as Estella (Emma Stone), a fashion genius who's not so much evil as misunderstood and maligned — not unlike Tonya Harding in director Craig Gillespie's last film, I, Tonya. Her backstory is framed as a more unhinged Devil Wears Prada, with Emma Thompson filling the role of the boss from hell. (In fact, The Devil Wears Prada screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna gets a ""story by"" credit here.) As a prequel, it's half-baked nonsense. As an excuse for the two Emmas to trade ever-bitchier quips and ever-more-outrageous outfits, it's a ball.

But Cruella needs to make a few stops before we get there. In its first half, the film skews more sweet than spiky, charting her journey from birth to grade school to a budding criminal career. Young Estella finds a family of sorts in fellow misfits Horace (Paul Walter Hauser, a cheerful scene-stealer) and Jasper (Joel Fry, a low-key heartthrob), and the three grow up picking pockets together in 1970s London — often with the help of their beloved dogs Buddy and Wink, because Cruella cannot emphasize enough that Estella is not the anti-canine monster you remember from those other movies.

It's not until Estella lands her dream job working for a high-fashion designer called the Baroness (Thompson) that she turns heel into Cruella, and even then it takes several plot twists to get her fully there. When she does, though, it's worth the wait. Estella is a role Stone could play in her sleep, cute and clever and easy to root for. Cruella, on the other hand, feels like Stone stretching her wings. With the help of a slinky walk, an extra-husky voice, and costumes to die for (oh, we'll get there), Stone refashions herself into the diva we never knew she had inside her.

And still she's eclipsed, intentionally, by Thompson, who not only matches Stone's Cruella smirk for smirk and insult for insult, but makes it look effortless — she'll ruin a person's whole life with less thought than she puts into her lunch order. Liberated from the burden of trying to appear even remotely relatable, Thompson plays up the Baroness's terrifying iciness; she is to this movie what Cruella herself was in the Dalmatians movies, which I suppose means she'll be due for her own revisionist prequel in about two more reboot cycles.

The most purely pleasurable stretch of Cruella comes in its middle, when these larger-than-life figures battle for headlines with increasingly elaborate gowns and the stunts to show them off. (This film takes place in a universe where one designer upstaging another is considered front-page news, and I want to go to there.) The Baroness's dresses are stunning in their own right, all luxe fabrics and elegant silhouettes, but it's in Cruella's that costume designer Jenny Beavan truly outdoes herself.

Cruella's designs are deliberately alienating, even ugly, and get edgier as she falls further into her wicked side; at one point, she literally turns trash into couture. They're outfits dreamed up by a woman who cares less about looking beautiful or tasteful than in making you look, period, and they represent as strong a statement about the character's renegade spirit as anything in Dana Fox and Tony McNamara's script or even Stone's performance.

These clothes are the boldest element of a movie that otherwise wears its supposed punk-rock influences like a kid discovering Hot Topic for the first time. Fun though it is, Cruella defaults too frequently to the safe and obvious: You can tell immediately that this is the kind of movie that's going to have the Rolling Stones' ""Sympathy for the Devil"" on the soundtrack, and lo and behold, there it is. Even the script struggles to leave well enough alone, padding its 135-minute run time with not just an extensive voiceover but multiple scenes in which Estella recaps recent plot points, and Dalmatians references that feel more obligatory than organic.

Then again, these are choices that make perfect sense for a family-friendly Disney crowdpleaser —which is what this actually is under all that jet-black eyeliner, even if Cruella and Cruella would prefer you to forget from time to time. Seen in that light, stacked against the studio's other recent live-action remakes, reboots, prequels, and sequels, it stands out as a pleasant surprise. Like the fashionista who gave it its name, Cruella is less interested in retracing old visions than dreaming up new ones, having a good time, and looking fabulous while doing it. And also like Cruella, it succeeds with flying colors."
63,DOE_Doc3_Cruella,DOE,Comedy,Negative,Cruella,"“It’s time to make some trouble. You in?” reads one of the posts promoting Cruella, Disney’s prequel-meets-reconsideration of the classic One Hundred and One Dalmatians villain. The line is in keeping with the film: It’s slick and witty and teasingly imprecise about what “trouble,” in this context, might entail. Previous incarnations of Cruella de Vil—including the 1961 animated film that gave us a song dedicated to her vileness—have paid fealty to the character’s outlandish fiendishness: This is someone who will attempt to murder puppies in order to make outerwear. The new version, which tells of Cruella’s life as a young fashion designer, both complicates and flattens the existing stories. Played with off-kilter aplomb by Emma Stone, the young Cruella is a hustler, a skilled self-promoter, and an influencer. She is not evil; she is merely complicated. She is a creature of 2020s America who happens to reside in 1970s London.

Cruella is the latest entry in the thriving genre of villain revisionism. The field includes lightly fictionalized reconsiderations of nonfictional events (works such as Confirmation and The People v. O. J. Simpson); documentaries such as The Clinton Affair, Lorena, and Framing Britney Spears; and retellings of old tales (Wicked, Maleficent) from the villain’s point of view. The genre is not new, but it is flourishing in an age shaped by the internet and fluent in the language of postmodernism: It tells the story about the story. It is deeply concerned with the totalizing power of authorship. It understands that villainy, as a category, is imposed—and that, in a culture that tends to prioritize reductive myths over complicated truths, the label can be its own kind of injustice.

Disney’s latest film is both an apotheosis and a nadir of the form. It goes out of its way to complicate, to relate, to correct. It takes a character so evil—so delightfully depraved—that she is named after the devil himself, and promises that she, too, can be rehabilitated. Its impulse toward retrospective empathy, however, strains credulity. (When a reassessment depends on the murderous capabilities of a dalmatian named Genghis, perhaps it has gone too far.) The Cruella you might know from earlier iterations is all but unrecognizable. Her defining cruelty has been switched out for the demands of glossy, girlboss feminism. Cruella is often fun to watch—it features some fantastic performances, some excellent lines, and some dazzling clothes—but its cavalier reversal of its core character cheapens the very idea of a corrective narrative. It takes a quintessential villain and nuances her character into oblivion.

Here is one simple way to render your villain instantly sympathetic: You make her the victim of trauma. Cruella begins, as many Disney stories do, with a child witnessing the death of a beloved parent. In this case, Cruella blames herself for the tragedy. Orphaned, she makes her way to London, where she takes up with two boys (this is how Jasper and Horace, Cruella’s eventual henchmen, enter the story). The three support themselves through thievery; she puts her great design skills to work creating elaborate costumes that enable their grifts. Everything changes when Jasper, recognizing her talent, gets her a job at a high-end department store. That leads to a job with the Baroness, the apex predator of London’s fashion scene. Cruella quickly discovers—and, warning, here are some spoilers—that the Baroness was responsible for her mother’s death. Driven by a desire for revenge, which might also be a desire for justice (the film is unclear on this crucial distinction), Cruella becomes a fashion star intent on displacing the Baroness. Heists and society balls and operatic plot twists ensue.

At no point, in this film based on 101 Dalmatians, does Cruella put dogs’ lives under threat. She makes some winking jokes about killing dogs and, for that matter, people. It is crucial to the film’s project that she never follows through. This Cruella is “bad” but not evil, and much depends on the difference. Instead, the cruelty in Cruella is outsourced: The villain is the Baroness, played with razor-sharp hauteur by Emma Thompson. She is calculating and cutting (sometimes literally: She nicks Cruella with a fabric cutter and, enchanted by the blood rather than abashed by it, orders staff to procure a fabric in the same color). She says things like “You’re helpful to me, is all. As soon as you’re not, you’re dust.”

The Baroness is emblematic of the film’s frenzied effort to have things both ways. The original Cruella is a great villain in part because her evil is so delightfully two-dimensional, so transcendentally cartoonish. She utters deliciously demonic lines (“Poison them! Drown them! Bash them! Drop them on their head! Got any chloroform?”) about adorable puppies. But Cruella, having argued that its main character is fundamentally good, cedes that depravity to the Baroness. As for Cruella, the traumatized orphan? She is seen scrubbing toilets (her job at the department store, it turns out, is janitorial) and being belittled by an imperious manager. The bids for sympathy are heavy-handed. How will Cruella finally break bad? Unclear. And not the point.

Another way that the film complicates its compassions: Cruella, in this rendering, is not one person but two. The character’s most defining physical feature—her starkly split-colored hair—has a psychological upshot. She is both Cruella (who is “born brilliant, born bad, and a little bit mad”) and Estella (who loved her mother and is essentially kind, if rebellious). This is a well-worn trope: Cruella/Estella is a version of Clark and Kal-El, Arthur and Joker, Jekyll and Hyde. But the bifurcation is so muddled that Cruella herself has to constantly clarify which of her alter egos she is embracing at a given moment. “I’m Cruella,” she will say, to her colleagues and the fourth wall. “Are you Cruella or Estella?” other characters will ask.

In some stories, the alter ego can be a way of exploring the elemental idea that people have dual, and sometimes dueling, capacities for goodness and badness. Here, though, the trope is used in much the same way that childhood trauma is: as a plot device, and as a way of making Cruella a character who offers something for everyone. Is Cruella good or bad? She is both. She is neither. She is exceptional. She is relatable. After a while—Cruella has a two-plus-hour running time—all the whiplash begins to look like indifference. The film’s efforts to frame its protagonist as a feminist antihero take the form of easy currency. Helen Reddy’s “I Am Woman, Hear Me Roar” is referenced unironically. In one scene, the Baroness utters the line “I choose me.” The whole thing can read, at times, as a game of corporate-feminist Mad Libs made corporeal.

“Each film is only as good as its villain,” Roger Ebert once observed, and the older Dalmatians films show why. Their stories have been elevated by Cruella’s delicious deviance. In her recent book, Women and Other Monsters: Building a New Mythology, Jess Zimmerman quotes Jeffrey Jerome Cohen, the dean of humanities at Arizona State University: “The monster dwells at the gates of difference,” he notes, in one of the insights that inform his seminal book Monster Theory. Monsters, Zimmerman argues, “separate acceptable from unacceptable, what’s allowed from what is not. Their monstrosity is deviation blown up to exaggerated size—the mythic equivalent of ‘if you keep doing that, your face will stick that way.’”

This is part of the visceral thrill of cinematic villainy. Villains tend to be much more entertaining to watch than heroes because their embrace of aberrance can be cathartic: They acknowledge the constraints imposed by cultures that are narrow in their empathies—and then studiously ignore them. Many of Disney’s greatest villains are coded as queer for this reason. (The Little Mermaid’s Ursula was inspired by Divine, the famous drag queen.) These characters dwell at the gates of difference and, crucially, have no interest in residing anywhere else.

Cruella nods to that transgressive power—and also reduces it. The queer character here, Artie (John McCrea), is not a villain but a friend of Cruella’s who happily agrees to serve as one of her assistants. Several other people in the film, two of them characters of color—including Cruella’s childhood friend Anita Darling (Kirby Howell-Baptiste), a main character of 101 Dalmatians—are similarly cast as cheerful agents of Cruella’s will. For a movie premised on corrective vision, these treatments are notably myopic. Cruella adopts The Queen’s Gambit idea of success; its plot assumes that everyone in Cruella’s world will happily drop what they’re doing to help her exact her revenge (or is it justice?). The film insists that her success is success for anyone who has been marginalized. She is an outsider, after all. Her clothes suggest the avant-gardism of Vivienne Westwood and Alexander McQueen. And yet: “I want to be like you,” she tells the Baroness. “You’re a very powerful woman.” So Disney has given us an allegedly punk antihero whose defining goal is to be respected within the establishment.

Every age gets the Cruella it deserves. The Cruella of the 1990s, an era whose mass culture was inflected by feminist backlash, was made monstrous not just by her murderousness, but also by her acute disinterest in marrying or mothering. (“Puppies, darling,” coos Glenn Close, infusing the role with maniacal glee. “I’ve no use for babies.”) The Cruella of the current moment—frenzied, flattened—is an icon for a time that finds the slogans of “empowerment” easy and the substance of empowerment hard. The film embraces the glib condescension of the idea that every villain must be, somehow, misunderstood—that a woman can’t be purely evil, that she must have a softer side, that her currency is her beguiling relatability. Watching this sumptuous revision, I longed for the classic Cruella: vain, vapid, willing to kill puppies, and never feeling the need to explain herself."
64,DOE_Doc4_Cruella,DOE,Comedy,Negative,Cruella,"As the saying goes, hurt people hurt people—or in this case, puppies. Cruella is the latest film in a recent barrage of villain origin stories that attempt to humanize antagonists by inventing past trauma. And as with other mononymous prequels, including Maleficent and Joker, Cruella leaves us wondering why. Part heist, part mystery, the movie is fun, stylish, and over the top (in mostly a good way), but it struggles to prove that it’s more than a muddled cash grab. Buried under couture looks and a pop song–riddled soundtrack is a film attempting to say something edgy about women’s genius being stifled and the futility of playing by the rules. Instead of achieving this goal, Cruella romanticizes girlbosses who treat those around them poorly in order to claw their way to the top. Just because a movie leaves audiences with unanswered questions doesn’t mean it needs a prequel. And just because a villain is a woman doesn’t mean she needs to be redeemed.

Set in the ’60s and ’70s, Cruella first introduces viewers to the vampy fur obsessive during her childhood, which is, of course, tragic. Born Estella (Tipper Seifert-Cleveland) with naturally two-toned hair, the future puppy-napper is a goodhearted but erratic and strong-willed child. Her mother, Catherine (Emily Beecham), gives her the nickname “Cruella,” and while she recognizes her daughter’s talent for fashion design, she also encourages her to suppress her wild side in order to stay out of trouble. Predictably, Estella ignores her mother’s advice and is expelled from school, setting off a chain of events that end in disaster. Catherine dies in a much-mocked scene involving—you guessed it—dalmations, and orphaned Estella begins a life of petty crime after befriending two young pickpockets. Ten years later, Estella (Emma Stone) is still living with her comrades Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser).

Though the three are getting by as thieves, Estella still dreams of breaking into the fashion world. She gets her chance during a zany mishap at the Liberty department store where she works, when she catches the eye of renowned, egomaniacal designer Baroness von Hellman (Emma Thompson), who offers her a job. This is when the prequel really begins: Estella slowly transforms into Cruella as she learns more about the Baroness, discovers truths about her own past, and unapologetically embraces her talent. Cruella is undeniably entertaining, and there are plenty of bright spots, but with a run time of more than two hours, it’s about 30 minutes too long. The writers use that extra half hour to insert tidbits from Dodie Smith’s 1956 novel, The Hundred and One Dalmatians, and introduce other familiar characters. In Cruella, Estella knows journalist Anita Darling (Florisa Kamara at age 12, and Kirby Howell-Baptiste as an adult) from school, just as she does in Smith’s book, and songwriter Roger Dearly (Kayvan Novak) can be heard singing Mel Leven’s “Cruella de Vil” from the 1961 animated movie One Hundred and One Dalmatians.

The main cast’s performance is also a highlight: In Cruella, as in The Favourite, Stone proves she’s good at being bad, Thompson is delightfully deranged as the Baroness, and the rest of the actors are clearly having a blast. The needle drops are crowd pleasing, albeit a bit much (I rolled my eyes when Blondie’s “One Way or Another” began playing over a montage of Cruella’s subversive fashion moments). And the costumes by Oscar-winning designer Jenny Beavan are as fabulous as those familiar with her work expected them to be. But when it comes to the plot, the movie begins to fall apart. In an Associated Press interview, Thompson describes the film as a “redemption story going backwards.” If the prequel was intended to redeem its namesake as Thompson says, it misses the mark. The movie doesn’t quite know who it wants this new Cruella to be. Is she a villain? An antihero? An anti-villain? In transforming her from an innately evil millionaire to an orphan who has independently overcome obstacles through inborn genius and hard work, Disney—one of the largest corporations in the world—is telling on itself.

More important, most people with difficult childhoods don’t become puppy killers. In fact, no part of the past Disney has created for Cruella indicates she will eventually skin dalmations, and the movie never explicitly explains why she despises them. Instead the film repeatedly indicates that despite her mom’s death, she not only tolerates but actively likes dogs. Although the movie intends to illuminate her motivations, they remain remarkably unclear. The ending, in particular, is a head-scratcher. Cruella offers more filler than useful information, and it feels like a prequel to a prequel, setting the stage for additional trauma to come. (Both Stone and Thompson have said they would do another movie to fill in the gaps, but sometimes it’s best to let sleeping dogs lie.) It’s also difficult to make sense of the film’s distorted politics. In the same AP interview, Thompson says that Cruella tackles “the idea of a woman being ruthless in order to release her creativity.” Sounds like some girlboss nonsense! She goes on to quote her character, who tells Cruella, “If I cared about anyone or thing, I might have died like so many brilliant women with a drawer full of unseen genius and a heart full of sad bitterness.”

The movie is full of faux-feminist capitalist platitudes such as this, and it’s unclear how viewers are supposed to receive them. The Baroness is abusive and sociopathic, but she believes gender-based oppression is real. Cruella follows in the Baroness’s footsteps to become similarly egotistical and murderous, but she had a hard childhood and has a gay friend, Artie (John McCrea). Are we supposed to clap? Despite these missteps, the New York Times declares that “If you set aside the dognapping and puppy-skinning plots (which are, admittedly, hard to overlook), Disney’s version of Cruella has always been a bit of a feminist fantasy.” In addition to the fact that you can’t brush off animal abuse (Cruella’s entire schtick), bad behavior doesn’t become feminist simply because a woman is the perpetrator. Like The Queen’s Gambit, Cruella also falls into the white feminist trap of using characters of color to facilitate a white woman’s journey without attempting to develop their interiority. At one point, Cruella storms into Anita’s office and tells her old friend, who in this version of the story is Black, “I want you to help me tell them who I am.” Presumably this is meant to be a girl-power moment, in which two women team up for a greater cause, but it’s really just about Cruella’s self-aggrandizement.

The Disney villain cinematic universe seems to characterize feminism thusly: When men are abusive, it’s the patriarchy; when (white) women are abusive, it’s empowerment. But no matter how you slice it, girlbosses are just…bosses. It’s fine to allow some antagonists, including women, to be irredeemable. There are plenty of interesting stories about legitimately misunderstood women to explore on the big screen—Lilith and Medusa come to mind. And, heck, as entertainment writer Abby Monteil tweeted, there are even other compelling women side characters in the same franchise who could use origin stories. Ultimately, Cruella is a Disney movie: It’s amusing and light—not necessarily trying to present a cohesive worldview or do much more than make money. But this cinematic tradition of retroactively excusing these characters’ atrocious behavior—or, worse, peddling it as feminism—feels out of touch. If a woman is bad, let her be bad."
65,DOE_Doc5_Cruella,DOE,Comedy,Negative,Cruella,"Cruella is Disney’s latest attempt at exploiting the studio’s library of animated classics in the live-action format. Here, the focus is a reimagining of 101 Dalmations‘ iconic villainess Cruella de Vil. However, no longer is Cruella the greedy, vain, petty, odious, repulsive and abusive aristocrat who is obsessed with fur and mistreats animals. She’s now an orphaned anti-hero on a quest for revenge against the woman who wronged her. Cruella becomes a fashionista vigilante with a punk-rock attitude.

Craig Gillespie’s take on Cruella de Vil is not the backstory for any existing version of the character. This is not the origin of the live-action version portrayed by Glenn Close, or Betty Lou Gerson’s version from the 1961 animated classic. It’s a top-to-bottom reimagining of the character. In past adaptations, Cruella has had no redeeming qualities whatsoever. As portrayed by Emma Stone, Disney’s new live-action version of Cruella has been bleached and shed of her amoral qualities and malicious center.

From a young age, Estella’s mean streak is characterized as a rebellious nature toward uptight authority figures and using extreme measures to take revenge against bullies. One incident too many get Estella expelled, and she and her poor mother, Catherine (Beecham), are forced to relocate to London. Unfortunately, a visit to a lavish fashion party at Hellman Hall that Cruella sneaks into ends in disaster and leaves Estella an orphan. She inexplicably finds her way to London where she falls in with local small-time crooks Horace and Jasper. Together they form a makeshift family unit and run two-bit thievery and cons over the years. Now adults, Jasper (Fry) and Horace (Hauser) encourage Estella to follow her dreams of becoming a designer as she’s destined for greater things.

Eventually, Estella’s creativity gains the recognition of one Baroness von Hellman, who virtually runs the world of haute couture in London. Ultimately, Estella finds her way into the Baroness’ inner circle. A connection to Cruella’s past puts her on a path of revenge to bring the Baroness down, so Cruella channels her naughty side into that of the fashion world’s wild card, Cruella. As Cruella, Estella makes a show of upstaging Baroness’ clothing line debuts, taking part in raucous displays of fashion-themed performance art. However, the ruthless Baroness is not one to have her spotlight stolen and is determined to crush her new fashion rival.

Cruella‘s strongest attribute is undoubtedly Emma Stone’s charismatic performance. She wears some stunning costumes and has an impressive presence here. Director Craig Gillespie does well in allowing Emma Stone to take center stage and letting her go wild. Much like the film, Stone’s performance is infused with a British punk rock attitude that, at times, is fun and exciting to watch.

Unfortunately, while Cruella certainly looks lavish and stylish, the substance of this story is lacking and is not justified for an overly-long cinematic experience. Now that Cruella, Horace and Jasper have been reimagined as the heroes of this story, they are lacking in the more unsavory qualities that would potentially find them at odds with the audience. In turn, that makes the central trio rather boring.

For example, Estella adopts a stray dog she names Buddy. Horace has a one-eyed pet chihuahua named Wink, who partners up with the group on their heists. Horace is completely devoted to his friend Wink and dotes on him like a son. They might be con artists and thieves, but deep down, this trio has hearts of gold. Any hint of nastiness from Estella is half-hearted, or part of her character arc in learning to trust her true friends and “family.”

This version of Cruella is only “bad” in a very loose sense. Jasper acts as the moral center and conscience for Cruella throughout the movie; and well, it’s all rather revolting. The meanest act Cruella commits is when she wrongly snaps at poor Jasper and Horace after she becomes too invested in her quest for vengeance. A “good” Cruella de Vil, who acts as the hero of the story, one who has to learn her moralistic lesson like a typical Disney protagonist, is boring. These characters simply do not work as the “good guys.” They are not interesting or compelling heroes.

Director Craig Gillespie and his fleet of five writers simply could not come up with a compelling idea for why there needs to be a nearly two hour and fifteen-minute story of a golden-hearted Cruella, Jasper and Horace getting back at a loathsome fashion designer. Even multiple connections made to the animated Disney version of One Hundred and One Dalmations are rather forced and pointless. Emma Stone’s performance does make this at least marginally more entertaining than the awful Maleficent films, but the story does not fare much better.

Once the narrative makes it clear this is a brand-new Cruella, virtually indecipherable from any past takes, it’s hard to stay invested in this story. At the very least, Maleficent operates under the premise that it’s the “true story” behind the legend of Sleeping Beauty. Cruella offers no such premise. There’s little justification to root for Cruella, Horace and Jasper now, other than the fact that they are the underdogs getting back at a rich, bourgeois aristocrat, who is the true villainess of the story.

The film’s only other bright spot is Emma Thompson, who interestingly enough, shares more qualities with Cruella de Vil than this movie’s version of Cruella. Even a talented actor such as Mark Strong, who plays a thankless role as the Baroness’ butler John in this film, looks rather bored as if he’s simply going through the motions.

Despite some minor, superficial visual similarities, this is Cruella in name only."
66,DOE_Doc6_Cruella,DOE,Comedy,Positive,Cruella,"Where Disney has struggled to find much inspiration or success in their recent live-action reimaginings of the studio's animated classics, Craig Gillespie's Cruella hopes to turn this train around with a dark yet incredibly campy look at the iconic 101 Dalmatians villain. Focusing on the origin story of Cruella de Vil (Emma Stone) and specifically the relationship she has with fashion mogul Baroness von Hellman (Emma Thompson) who is tied to the death of Cruella's mother; Cruella stands as a genuine reimagination of the classic villain that builds towards something new by using the established lore of the character rather than exploiting it for a cheap momentary gain. 

Before one can dive into the substance within Cruella, it is important to note the packaging in which the product arrives in. Where many of these live-action Disney adaptations struggle to translate the aesthetic and world of the original animated film to the realm of live-action with some such as Aladdin and Dumbo ultimately becoming complete messes in tone and style. Cruella however doesn't just build a competent sense of tone but a confident one. Blending queer camp with a punk rock industrial bite, Cruella creates an original aesthetic that compliments both the story and the strengths of the team behind the project. Nearly halfway through the year, Cruella easily stands out so far when it comes to departments like production design and costume design with a true sense of artistry felt throughout. The only piece of the technical puzzle to sometimes disappoint would be the CGI which often can look awkward and forced, but that is far from enough to ruin the accomplishments that surround it in the technical departments.

The casting within Cruella also carries a sense of skill and thoughtfulness which can be felt in the final result. Where Emma Stone enters a role with big shoes to fill following the iconic and over-the-top rendition Glenn Close gave the performance in the other popular live-action version of the story, Stone brings her own devilish charm to the performance that brings together cruelty and charm in a surprisingly competent package. Stone might not always be likable, but she always demands attention and controls the screen with her presence in a way that almost redefines what one could expect from Stone as an actress. In this sense, Cruella feels as if it clearly is taking inspiration from director Craig Gillespie's previous feature I, Tonya which also demanded empathy and understanding for the ever-controversial figure of Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie) without completely erasing her demons or guilt. On the sidelines Joel Fry, Paul Walter Hauser & John McCrea bring the majority of the comedy and morality to the feature being the only group of characters that feel rather morally pure without ever taking away from the more gritty and mature sides of the feature. In direct opposition to Stone stands Emma Thompson who also has a sense of wickedness to her performance that is felt through every line delivery and glance she gives.

These elements all come together to make the voice of Cruella feel rather powerful and successful but the biggest question surrounding the film was if its message was going to be worth sharing. So many of these Disney remakes have felt hollow and empty but Cruella is different. As mentioned earlier with the comparison to I, Tonya, at the very least Cruella creates an engaging story of a young woman seeking revenge and closure for her past and at the most creates an exploration of chosen family and not letting one's bloodline determine their destiny. Where nothing within Cruella feels that revolutionary or impactful, this depth is enough to captivate audiences surprisingly well for the film's longer 134-minute runtime and feels worthy enough to be put onto the big screen. The screenplay however does leave some to be desired. Specifically within the transformation from the overall innocent Estella and more cruel Cruella, there is a switch that isn't fully justified and specifically, the complications in the relationship between her and her friends as a result does feel a bit forced. Being a Disney feature there also is bound to be plenty of moral complications within the soul of the feature. It doesn't take much digging to find a mental illness reading of the film which feels rather problematic and where the LGBTQ+ representation within the film does feel less offensive than previous efforts such as Avengers: Endgame and Onward, it still leaves a laughable amount to be desired and the idea that it would be touted once again as being something of substance is genuinely quite revolting.

Where Cruella might not be anything close to a masterpiece, especially in the lineup of Disney live-action remakes this clearly falls towards the top of the list. Stylish and personable, it is incredibly easy to get lost within Cruella's world and have a fun time with the characters and camp that exist within the film's runtime. For those wanting a fun return to the theater or simply are willing to pay the premium price to stream the film through Disney+, Cruella stands as a solid enough recommendation and is sure to become a fan favorite over the coming years."
67,DOE_Doc7_Cruella,DOE,Comedy,Positive,Cruella,"“Cruella de Vil, Cruella de Vil, if she doesn’t scare you, no evil thing will…”. This ditty in Disney’s 1961 animation 101 Dalmations leaves little room for nuance as it introduced one of its most enduring villains. Whether hand drawn, or in the form of Glenn Glose’s 90s portrayals, Cruella de Vil is a narcissistic, psychotic baddie whose main goal is to skin puppies for a coat. 

It was deemed strange, then, when it was announced that Emma Stone would be starring in a prequel focusing on the character’s early days. Disney had achieved some success with Maleficent, which retconned Sleeping Beauty’s story into something a bit more sympathetic to the antagonist. However, Cruella is different. To make her sympathetic would surely mean stripping away a lot of the character’s appeal, and of course there’s the question that haunts any prequel – do we really need to know how a villain became so villainous?

I, Tonya director Craig Gillespie knows something about telling the story of a hated figure. He takes us back to the 1960s, where a young, brilliant child called Estella can’t seem to suppress a dark side, which her mother calls Cruella. Following a tragic accident, Estella finds herself orphaned and takes up a life of crime in London. Ten years later, an adult Estella (Stone) lives off her wits with partners in crime Jasper and Horace (Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser), but never gave up on her dream of being a fashion designer. 

She gets a big break when she accidentally catches the eye of Baroness von Hellman (Emma Thompson), the head of a prestigious fashion house who is as vindictive as she is brilliant. However, as the pressures of her new career and revelations from the past come to light, Cruella begins to surface and create a whole lot of trouble. 

Set primarily in the 70s, Gillespie puts together a chic film with jaw-dropping costumes and a soundtrack that includes everything from Nina Simone and Dusty Springfield to Iggy Pop and The Clash. As she glides around in a couture dreamland, two very clear sides of our lead’s personality are created – Estella and Cruella. Estella’s journey helps explain how we got to the infamous Disney villain, creating explanations for her behaviour, but not excuses. It’s clever, but makes the first hour drag a little as you wait for the fun to begin. The trio’s schemes are repetitive, and the exposition occasionally throttling. Even Stone seems to acknowledge it – “there’s lots more bad things coming, I promise” she says in her semi-regular narration.

At around the hour mark she walks into her secret base as the character we recognise, ready to fulfil that promise. It’s a fabulous moment that picks up the pace. Stone has much more fun as Cruella than she did as Estella, and so do we. The filmmakers seem to get the message that we’d rather laugh with a villain than cry with a victim, and so while there is some depth added to her story, there are enough delightfully evil moments to sustain the audience. 

The plot is a bit muddled, with obvious influences that are never fully realised. When it works, though, it’s a delight, combining Gillespie’s visual flair with Stone’s endless charm. Sequences such as Cruella’s publicity stunts are chaotic and utterly gorgeous, with the Oscar winner giving it everything as she throws out wonderful one liners (“I’d like to remind you that I’m doing this all in heels”). 

Thompson is equally brilliant, channelling some Miranda Priestly-like menace, but with just a suggestion of silliness that makes it fun. She can barely contain her glee as she orders around a busy design floor and dismisses Estella as a “grubby girl”. She’s perfect for this movie, and provides a platform for Stone to shine. 

Elsewhere, Fry and Hauser are sweet and funny as Cruella’s lackies (although Hauser’s cockney accent is a bit Mary Poppins). Jon McCrea is a breath of fresh air as Artie, a genderfluid designer Cruella falls in with; while there’s no official coming out, the character is a solid example of how to present an unambiguously Queer presence in a mainstream film without resorting to stereotypes. Mark Strong is present as The Baroness’ right-hand man, a role that feels a bit slight for someone of his stature.

Cruella wanders somewhat, but resists the temptation to rewrite history and make its anti-hero sympathetic. Instead, we have a kind of family friendly Joker – a retro tale of a misfit searching for identity, before giving into the madness. Did we need to know how Cruella became such a devil? Probably not. Then again, darlings, it was a lot of fun. "
68,DOE_Doc8_Cruella,DOE,Comedy,Positive,Cruella,"f there are some familiar notes in Craig Gillespie’s film Cruella, blame Meryl Streep and Heath Ledger. When films feature flamboyantly demanding female bosses or flamboyantly homicidal maniacs, then Streep’s and Ledger’s work in The Devil Wears Prada (2006) and The Dark Knight (2008), respectively, loom large. Though both Emma Stone and Emma Thompson are fantastic in the Cruella, they cannot help but create characters under the imposing shadows of Streep’s Miranda Priestly or Ledger’s Joker.

But even if there are some derivative points in Cruella, the latest in Disney’s mining of its vaults for live-action renditions of its animated classics, the film is an excellent crime caper and origin story of the iconic titular character. Taking its cues from the original source material, The Hundred and One Dalmatians by Dodie Smith as well as Clyde Geronimi’s 1961 animated feature, Gillespie’s vision is far darker and stylized – an homage to 1970s London when high fashion and punk slammed into each other, making the city the fashion epicenter of the world.

Though set in the ’70s, the aesthetic isn’t devotedly accurate, so the sartorial look of the film has a general span of late ’60s to early ’80s, with heavy influences of Vivienne Westwood, Alexander McQueen, Patricia Field, Betsey Johnson, and Anna Sui. It’s a kaleidoscope of fashion that leaves viewers a bit dizzy from the cavalcade of imaginative outfits that Stone and Thompson wear throughout the film. (Costume designer Jenny Beavan deserves the lion’s share of credit for the film’s critical success.)

Cruella‘s brilliant soundtrack does a great job of scoring the film, with music supervisor Susan Jacobs dipping into some choice songs that perfectly accompany the action: whether it’s David Bowie’s rocking “Boys Keep Swinging”, Nancy Sinatra’s hypnotic “These Boots Are Made for Walkin’’, or Judy Garland’s tremulous “Smile”, the music is a key component in manipulating audiences’ reactions to the actions. The Rolling Stones’ psychedelic rock of “She’s a Rainbow” does a gorgeous job of scoring the montage of Cruella coming of age, as well as, impishly buttressing scenes of her prodigious talent at petty theft, as she breezes through the streets of London, collecting lucre from unsuspecting victims on buses.

Working off a script by Dan Fox and Tony McNamara, the origin story of Cruella De Vil is a sad one, suitable for Gillespie’s Tim Burton-esque interpretation of the story. Born to a poor, but loving mother (Emily Beecham), young Cruella – born Estella – has a troubled childhood that is marred by tragedy that leads the young Estella to become an orphan. She finds kinship with two child grifters – Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser) – and the three grow up to become expert pickpockets and petty thieves.

The brilliant, fashion-obsessed Estella is an extraordinary criminal, but she wants more. Through the kind machinations of Jasper, she lands a job at the iconic department store, Liberty, which is handily near Carnaby Street, a major inspiration for the film’s look. Starting from the bottom (there’s an amusing montage of Stone’s Estella cleaning toilets and schlepping trash to the alley set to the Zombies’ “Time of the Season”), she pines to do more, hoping to insinuate herself in the tailoring department.

After a drunken night of cleaning the store, she stumbles into a window, rearranging the stiff, stodgy vision of the window dresser, Malcom McLaren’ing the whole thing. Though the store’s oily manager wants to fire her, fashion giant Baroness von Hellman (Thompson), sees vision and brilliance in Estella’s work and hires her on the spot.

What follows is a pitch-black comedy that plucks inspiration from such disparate sources like Carol Reed’s Oliver (1960), the aforementioned Devil Wears Prada, David Bowie, the Sex Pistols, and Alex Cox’s Sid and Nancy (1986). Once the plot’s major twist is unveiled, we’re watching a duel between Stone and Thompson, and the two divas revel in their roles, chewing scenery and striking dramatic poses and just being super fabulous.

Stone – slight inconsistency with her accent notwithstanding – does a masterful job of filling out the spidery concept of Cruella. As her character’s grasp on sanity loosens, Stone is able to masterfully portray her emotional fraying. During the film, she essentially must play two characters – the meek, dutiful Estella and the unhinged Cruella – and does so with aplomb, ably showing Cruella’s increasingly bleak hold on her sanity and morality.

As Cruella’s nemesis, Thompson marches through the role like a haughty, self-possessed drag queen. Like Stone, Thompson is given a rack of fabulous costumes, each more stylized and ridiculous than the rest; the sharp tailoring of her outfits reflects her imperious, queenly attitude. With her snappy reading of the lines, Thompson comes off as terrifying. Gillespie gifts the actress with some great closeups to allow for her to do some great emoting, using her beautiful yet expressive and rubbery face to convey a million variations of contempt, anger, or contempt, in a single acrid curl of her lip or flare of a nostril.

But the brilliance of Stone and Thompson presents an interesting scenario for viewers: who does one root for in a film like Cruella? An increasingly violent and horrifying anti-heroine or the evil villainous antagonist? Both actresses do enough to flesh out the characters, so that they don’t come off as merely one-dimensional cartoons – and Stone’s Cruella has a tragic, Dickensian back story that always informs whatever diabolical shenanigans she gets herself into. But the script seems to struggle with who the audience should relate to. At certain points, the empathetic and warm performances of Fry and Hauser as her family-cum-henchmen mean that they are the most likable and endearing characters. Their early scenes with Stone are sweet but soon their interactions become menacing and disturbing as Estella’s transformation into Cruella means she lashes out at her friends, treating them cruelly, abusing their loyalty.

A film like Cruella tells its story with arresting set pieces and there are some jaw-dropping scenes staged beautifully. When Cruella begins to orchestrate elaborate ways to scoop and usurp the Baroness’ dominance on the fashion scene, the audience is treated to some visually eye-melting scenes – many of which amp up the fashion aspect of the film (arguably, the film’s strongest suit). The scenes are staged with stunning ingenuity, reflecting the brilliance behind the character’s ability to steal focus away from the Baroness.

At one fashion show, for example, the Baroness makes a grand entrance, looking fabulous, only to be upstaged by a virtuoso Cruella, who is deposited at the foot of the red carpet, by a garbage truck, tumbling out in a tangle of tulle, before emerging in a gorgeous gown with an impossibly long train. To top off that spectacle, she quickly exits the scene, holding on to the back of the departing truck, letting the train unspool dramatically, leaving the poor Baroness whimpering in its wake.

In another incredibly shot scene, Cruella sets up a booby trap for the Baroness, secreting moth larvae into a vault that is storing a collection of precious gowns. Once the vault is opened, thousands of moths emerge fluttering everywhere, causing extras to dash in a panic. The Baroness, to her credit, was impervious, standing ramrod still as the tsunami of bugs washed over her.

So much works for Cruella that when it doesn’t, the faults stand out. Gillespie is committed to telling his story in a dark, stylized manner, having Cruella adopt a Sid Vicious/Adam Ant posture, which works fabulously. As she descends into madness, her outfits begin to reflect her further embrace of evil, and it’s glorious to watch such an extravagantly awful villain emerge.

However, because this is a Disney property, there are moments when the script pulls back and it hedges its bets. For example, we’re led to believe that at one point, Cruella killed a pack of dalmatians to make a fabulous coat (but she doesn’t – a surprisingly disappointing narrative retreat that rings false); we’re also assured a number of times, that Cruella isn’t interested in killing her nemesis, just humiliating her, which doesn’t feel wholly consistent with the character’s feeling of hot vengeance. Also, the family unit between Cruella, Jasper, and Horace endures despite her increasingly cruelty and awful behavior. Thus, the affection begins to feel forced towards the end, as the power imbalance grows between Cruella and her two friends (who devolve from partners to henchmen). But these are minor quibbles, because the over all experience of watching Cruella is a thrilling and stylish one."
69,DOE_Doc9_Cruella,DOE,Comedy,Negative,Cruella,"“It’s not hatred that’s important, it’s the desire to annihilate,” says a character in 101 Dalmations (1996), describing the one quality a villain must inspire in order to be successful. The titular character of Cruella, an origin story for that film’s antagonist, evokes neither. One of its many, many needle-drops is The Rolling Stones’s ‘Sympathy For The Devil’ but even after two hours and 14 minutes, the film comes nowhere close to painting her as one. Instead, she’s reimagined as a sympathetic character who’s lived a hardscrabble life, loves dogs and misses her dead mum fiercely. Are we really meant to root for the same woman who’d go on to skin puppies? Cruella attempts to be several films at once — a heightened glimpse of the fashion scene, a heist movie, a revenge tale — and isn’t half bad at any of them, only hurt by its insistence on serving as an origin story for this well-known character. What could’ve been a gripping narrative about a woman gradually giving in to her darker impulses is undercut by its need to tie into a family-friendly Disney property. 

Cruella’s initial narration plays out like an odious stepmother gleefully reading out a particularly dark fairytale to the children. “Don’t worry, we’re just getting started. There’s lots more bad things coming, I promise,” she coos at one point. While the benefit of hindsight can contextualise a story, Cruella (Emma Stone) uses hers to rewrite the narrative. She’s adamant that signs of her genius are apparent from an early age, despite little visual evidence, and attributes schoolyard brawls to feminist underpinnings, rather than mere childish rage. Some bits of her backstory, like how she got her ‘Cruella’ moniker, are convincing. Others, like her mother’s death, a laughably absurd sequence, less so. The people in Cruella’s orbit behave as though they know they’re characters in a film. Her friends, Jasper (Ziggy Gardner) and Horace (Joseph MacDonald), are scrappy and precocious, her mother is ever-ready to cater to her whims. This characterisation only makes sense when viewed through the lens of an adult recalling childhood memories. 

Director Craig Gillespie’s kinetic camerawork works best in a scene in which he swirls around the interiors of a department store that the now-adult Cruella’s begun working at, only to finally arrive at her, scrubbing a toilet floor, one level down. In a nice touch, the film has ditched its fairytale atmosphere. A few scenes later, however, it opts for a heaping of The Devil Wears Prada instead, once Cruella begins working for Baroness von Hellman (Emma Thompson), an exacting fashion designer whose words drip with perpetual disdain. The two Emmas play wonderfully off each other, with Thompson delivering commands and praise with equal measured relish. The costumes, by Oscar-winning designer Jenny Beavan, are stunning.

The film, however, flies off the rails when Cruella does. The arc of a woman uncovering a tragic secret about her past and subsequently deciding to self-sabotage, pushing away those closest to her, makes narrative sense on paper but induces total tonal whiplash onscreen. Stone leans full-tilt into the maniacal ‘Cruella’ alter ego, complete with a hokey accent and garish white face paint. Taking her cues from All About Eve (1950), in which an interloper closely attempts to replicate her idol’s lifestyle and gradually steal it away from her, she plots to bring down the Baroness. Only her plans involve showing up at places the Baroness is at and…being better dressed than her?

The cruel and manipulative Baroness is really the character more suited to a villain origin story. Cruella is still unlikeable, but her offences pale in comparison to the Baroness’s capacity for inflicting torment, the older woman’s jagged edges softening Cruella’s by comparison. The film, already overstuffed, becomes a slog to sit through once the two begin their game of one-upmanship. By the end, it’s not so much a clear-cut origin story as it is a muddled, too-long franchise filler, unable to provide insight into why Cruella began skinning animals for fashion in the first place. She’s still all bark, no bite."
70,DOE_Doc10_Cruella,DOE,Comedy,Negative,Cruella,"An overblown and unnecessary waste of $200 million, Disney’s Cruella encapsulates everything that is wrong with modern studio moviemaking and the IP-driven approach that the Mouse House is responsible for cultivating.

Some time around the late 2000s, Disney decided that it no longer wanted to make movies with modest budgets, and that instead, it would devote all its resources to producing only tentpoles. And so it set about purchasing everything from Lucasfilm to Marvel, and then, eventually, all of Fox. And while this plan has proven to be very successful, it is solely responsible for the franchise-heavy filmmaking that most studios are now focussing on.

Cruella, a prequel to the live-action 101 Dalmatians (itself a remake), is a film that absolutely nobody was asking for. And yet, it exists. The recent announcement that a sequel had been greenlit is only partially a clever PR move by the company, which is in the middle of a public legal tussle with Scarlett Johansson. Mostly, it’s an indication of just how tragically the industry has driven itself into a creative corner. A sequel to Cruella is apparently a more attractive proposition to the studio than something that costs half as much but would be doubly memorable.

Because in the two-odd months since I watched this movie, it has all but evaporated from my mind. The only thing that has resisted the pull of irrelevance is the performance of Paul Walter Hauser. He is, perhaps, this generation’s Steve Buscemi or John Goodman, equally comfortable at playing supporting roles as he is at playing leads.

He is the standout performer in Cruella, a film that stars two Emmas with three Oscars between them. As the comic relief character Horace, Hauser goes hard, settling on a semi-deadpan that is not only regularly funny, but also made me wonder why director Craig Gillespie didn’t ask the rest of the cast to match his energy. Instead, Gillespie blows what seems like the majority of the film’s budget on endless needle-drops and CGI dogs.

The inherent goofiness of the plot demands a certain level of camp, but neither Cruella the film nor the character is willing to commit. Instead, Gillespie aims for a faux-edginess that wears off almost immediately. To compensate, he has characters say things like, “You have a bit of an extreme side,” to Cruella’s face, as if the film is afraid to actually show just how extreme her cruelty can be. As it turns out, she’s just an oddball dealing with a traumatic past — a routine-enough backstory, but for Disney, positively risque.

Emma Stone delivers a strangely distant performance as Estella/Cruella, who runs away to London after her mother is gruesomely killed by a bunch of dogs in the opening sequence. She’s immediately taken in by a couple of kids who live by themselves in a loft that looks it like would probably cost millions of pounds. The two boys invite Estella to join their merry band, and together, they hustle their way up the social ladder.

Some years later, the trio, now having developed a strong platonic bond — this is a Disney movie, so romance isn’t allowed to complicate their dynamic — Estella finds work at the city’s most prestigious fashion label, where her talent is immediately spotted by the owner, Baroness von Hellman (Emma Thompson).

What unfolds is a cross between The Devil Wears Prada and The Favourite, and to understand the level of complacency that went into creating this movie, all you to know is that Disney actually enlisted Aline Brosh McKenna and Tony McNamara to contribute to Cruella’s script. Do these names ring a bell? Well, McKenna wrote The Devil Wears Prada, and McNamara co-wrote The Favourite. It’s almost a miracle that Todd Phillips’ name doesn’t pop up in the credits, because along with those two films, the next biggest reference point seems to be Joker.

Like a shoddily-stitched dress, the film comes apart at the seams roughly halfway through, when Estella decides that she no longer wishes to be a pushover, and becomes a villain instead. What? How? It’s bizarre. One minute she’s a sorry little person who wants to be noticed, and in the next, she’s announcing her transformation into a flamboyant figure named Cruella by putting together a punk rock show in the middle of the street.

It feels a little unearned, and frankly, it would’ve worked better had Estella’s about-face been reserved for the film’s final act, you know, like Joker. But by suddenly turning her into a largely unsympathetic character, not only does the film undo the groundwork that it had laid in the past hour, but it also leaves you wondering what to feel for the remaining 60 minutes (it’s a long movie, you guys). Are we supposed to magically forget what we just watched, or are we expected to actually root for this rude person who seems to have invaded the movie? Because there’s very little similarity between Estella and Cruella, even superficially.

For all its pretend-punk rock spirit, Cruella is probably one of the most conformist-minded studio pictures this side of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Remember, if costumes alone made a good movie, then Sanjay Leela Bhansali would’ve been the world’s best director. Cruella isn’t as unbearable as Bhansali’s films, but it simply isn’t compelling.



"
71,SAV_Doc1_TheMatrixResurrections,SAV,Sci-Fi,Positive,The Matrix Resurrections,"There’s a scene early in the The Matrix Resurrections where Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves), a wildly successful video game designer, sits around a table with his development team to talk about a follow-up to his visionary game The Matrix, which he’d based around his own distant dreams. As Anderson’s minions geek out about the project, they talk about the legacy of this game that has become a cultural phenomenon. How it’s about trans politics. Or crypto fascism. Or capitalist exploitation. And how, if they were to revisit this world, it couldn’t be just another reboot. Welcome to The Matrix: Into the Metaverse. 
The ambivalence co-writer/director Lana Wachowski feels about returning to the science-fiction trilogy she wrapped up with her sister, Lilly, nearly two decades ago, is so obvious in The Matrix Resurrections that she’s made it part of the narrative fabric. If you’re asking the questions, “Why another Matrix? And why now?,” rest assured that Wachowski is puzzling over them, too, right out in the open. There are cynical commercial reasons for the project: The Wachowskis haven’t had a hit since the trilogy, only a string of cult items like Speed Racer, Cloud Atlas, Jupiter Ascending, and the Netflix series Sense8. And we’ve entered an era where there’s a dwindling market for any big-budget movie that’s not based on preexisting IP—which, of course, means that the original Matrix would not get made today, but the demand for another sequel is high. 
But it would be unfair to assume iconoclasts like the Wachowskis are chasing a quick money grab, as ungainly and superfluous a prospect as a sequel to a trilogy might appear to be. For people across the sociopolitical spectrum, The Matrix was a defining moment, a red-pilled accounting of a world—our world— that felt radically destablized, evolving past the point where it could be controlled—or even understood. There have been indications that the Wachowskis are more sympathetic to the film being embraced as an expression of trans identity than as a touchstone for alt-right dipshits—as evidenced by Lilly’s now-legendary clothesline of Elon Musk and Ivanka Trump on Twitter—but there’s also a general sense that the significance of the trilogy had gotten away from them. A new film could wrest it back, and perhaps become an updated vessel for technical wizardry and philosophical nuggets.
That’s the idea, anyway. The reality seems even simpler: Lana Wachowski loves her characters as much as the films’ admirers do, and wants to see them revived, so much so that this sequel’s dense narrative architecture is built around their reunion. Those other rationales are more thinly supported, as a smattering of fresh insights float around in the film’s conversational soup, and the action sequences mostly evoke a sense of déjà vu, albeit with a notably shocking new element in the grand finale. There’s too much thought invested in creating The Matrix Resurrections to dismiss it as mere fan service, but fans getting serviced is not exactly a minor side effect of the experience, either. The film struggles to justify its existence.
Opening in the cozy, false, lame-o environment of the Matrix, the film finds Mr. Anderson, the man we know as “Neo” or “The One,” leading a simple yet troubled life as a gaming guru. His memories of the world as it really is—the one controlled by the Machines, who extract energy from humans like batteries—have mostly been relegated to dreams that he shares with his analyst (Neil Patrick Harris). But Anderson can’t stop thinking that he recognizes a woman  at the coffee shop named Tiffany (Carrie Anne-Moss), who looks like the person we know as Trinity, only she has kids and a dopey husband named Chad. All gets explained when young agents, led by Bugs (Jessica Henwick) and a refashioned Morpheus (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), bring him out of the Matrix and back into the grubbier realm of the truth. 
The Matrix Resurrections has a long wind-up before it delivers the pitch, which can’t entirely be blamed on the need to re-acclimate us to a world that took three films and a lot of explaining to establish. Wachowski spends an inordinate amount of time ruminating on her own creation rather than moving it forward to the uncharted territory—which, in its way, puts the film in line with the new phase of Marvel movies like Spider-Man: No Way Home and the paralyzing self-awareness that has gone along with it. But this remains that rarer of things: A personal vision writ extremely large, with a still-singular graphic splendor and juicy themes of identity, consent, and the limits of conspiratorial thinking. Whatever Easter eggs viewers might find here are at least laid by the White Rabbit. "
72,SAV_Doc2_TheMatrixResurrections,SAV,Sci-Fi,Positive,The Matrix Resurrections,"“The Matrix Resurrections” is something unusual: A reluctant sequel. An early scene has Neo (Keanu Reeves) back in the simulated reality of the title with no memory of having saved mankind over the course of three 20-year-old movies. Or, rather – stay with me here – in this new Matrix reality, he has sublimated those memories into the creation of three wildly successful videogames, also called “The Matrix” and also 20 years old. And now Warner Bros. wants a reboot videogame, with him or without him, and the hero’s beaten-down weariness at reviving past glories apparently mirrors the disgust that “Matrix” directors Lana and Lilly Wachowski felt when they heard that the real Warner Bros. was planning to go ahead with this very movie – with them or without them. (Since Lilly Wachowski had other commitments, her sister ended up directing “Resurrections” solo.) The entire sequence is a stiff middle finger to the suits in the front office as well as a moment so cubically meta that it just about eats its own tail.
Eventually, Neo gets his groove back – no, I won’t spoil anything in the way of details – but Reeves’ middle-aged exhaustion is part of the warp and weft of the new movie, much as it was in last year’s “Bill and Ted” reunion. With one exception, the action sequences in “Resurrections” are plentiful but perfunctory, as though Wachowski were fulfilling a contractual obligation. Instead, the movie’s pulse resides with the characters and the feelings that flow between them. This Neo doesn’t really care about being the Chosen One anymore. He just wants to get Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) out of that Instant Pot the machines keep humans in. Back in the Matrix, Neo and Trinity have never met yet they’re still somehow connected at a molecular level, and there’s a nice little coffee shop scene between the two as they puzzle hesitantly over their attraction – it’s a charged, emotionally erotic moment more real than anything else in the movie, in part because the two actors, both in their mid-50s, have some mileage on them.
Is Lana Wachowskis sabotaging her own film? Not really, but you can tell she’d rather spend time with the humans. Jada Pinkett Smith returns, under unfortunate old age make-up, as resistance leader Niobe, and there’s a new character, a blue-haired rebel named Bugs (Jessica Henwick) who more or less functions as the film’s Han Solo. The great guru Morpheus has been recast – or reconstituted, or something – as a younger figure played by the charismatic Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (HBO’s “Watchmen,” “The Trial of the Chicago 7”). The other rebels are given grace and individuality, while the chief antagonists are played by deft hams: Jonathan Groff (George III in “Hamilton”) as the rogue Agent Smith and Neil Patrick Harris as Neo’s cagey therapist. It’s the latter villain who speaks most mischievously of how this latest iteration of the Matrix has been designed to pander to consumers hooked on gunfights, explosions, and slo-mo “Bullet Time” — which is Lana Wachowski’s way of telling us what she’s not interested in.
There is a great deal of gunplay in “The Matrix Resurrections,” of course, and it may be intentionally funny that the bad guys shoot so many rounds without hitting a goddamn thing while the good guys hit their mark every time. The movie is violent but bloodless in a way that appears to be purposeful; the one scene where you actually feel the horror of what’s happening involves dozens of Matrix citizens throwing themselves off ledges and out of windows in an effort to “bomb” the heroes. Leaping off a precipice is a recurrent theme in this movie, and the people to trust are the ones who are most afraid to fall.
Another recurrent theme is the importance of choice and how, when presented with two options, there’s always the possibility of choosing a third. Look, either you care deeply about the “Matrix” movies – meaning you were probably between the ages of 15 and 30 when the first one came out – or they mean little to you. Or you’re like me and you find the whole series and its what-is-reality dorm-room philosophizing enjoyably silly. (It helps to be a Keanu fan, which we very much are in this house.) The first group stands to be perplexed by the new film, but casual fans may appreciate it as a way of dispensing with the whole blue pill/red pill nonsense and exploring the other avenues available. “The Matrix Resurrections” may be the first non-binary blockbuster."
73,SAV_Doc3_TheMatrixResurrections,SAV,Sci-Fi,Positive,The Matrix Resurrections,"The second and most recent sequel to the game-changing 1999 blockbuster “The Matrix” happened 18 years ago. That’s a long time to hang tough for a third follow-up. And yet “The Matrix Resurrections,” the last Warner Bros. movie to debut simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max (we’ll have to wait 45 days for streaming in the future), is counting on our loyalty.
Good luck with that. Audiences can be fickle what with Marvel and DC Comics-inspired epics distracting us with Avengers, Lego Batmen and multiple webslingers from the Spider-Verse. To most millennials, Keanu Reeves isn’t Neo, the chosen One to save humanity from rogue machines. He’s John Wick, a fresher, fiercer man in black.
And yet “The Matrix Resurrections,” directed by a wowza Lana Wachowski for the first time without her sister Lilly, still holds us in its tantalizing grip. If you’ve never seen a “Matrix” movie you may have to resort to a syllabus and a highlighter to get hip to this one. Or you could just jump down the rabbit hole and go with the flow. This movie is a stone-cold trip.
Among the new characters is a dynamite Jessica Henwick as Bugs, as in Bunny, a purple-haired cyber-anarchist from the real world (or is it?) who wonders why someone is using the old Matrix code to mess with the new one.
That would be Reeves as Thomas Anderson, the creator of three “Matrix” video games that are so hot another sequel is demanded. A resistant Anderson, still in recovery from a suicide attempt, mopes around San Francisco with no memory of his past as Neo. His therapist (a cheeky Neil Patrick Harris), ominously stroking a black cat, steers him through the mental muck.
Wachowski inserts clips from “The Matrix” trilogy to ease us into Laurence Fishburne’s Morpheus morphing into uber-cool Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Hugo Weaving’s Agent Smith into a saucy and sinister Jonathan Groff as a corporate honcho who knows reboots sell even if no one can figure out whether the games are about capitalist exploitation or gender transition.
Count nothing out, even in a movie where the fight scenes seem secondhand—nothing can match the OG Neo bending his body to the trajectory of a bullet—and the philosophical mumbo-jumbo ties itself in knots of tangled self reflection. There are mirrors everywhere.
What saves “The Matrix Resurrections” from its own meta traps is the love connection between Neo and Trinity. I know, they both died in the second sequel, 2003’s “The Matrix Revolutions,” which no one liked, but sellable product never dies, not in Hollywood.
It works out great this time. Plus, it’s a kick to see scrappy beauty Carrie-Anne Moss back as Trinity. OK, when we first see her she’s Tiffany, a wife and mother with a thing for motorbikes. Still, something is triggered when Tiff and Mr. Anderson run into each other at a coffee shop.
And you know what? Reeves and Moss, both in their 50s, are funny, touching and swooningly romantic icons of cool. Their ferocity and feeling carries over to the inevitable moments when Neo and Trinity are reunited in battle in the simulated world of the Matrix.
In her fourth flight into alt-reality, Wachowski again skewers a narcotized sphere where humans dull our senses on a loop of numbing diversions. In Matrix terms that means they’re swallowing the blue pill of contented ignorance instead of the red pill of unsettling truth.
The protracted climax of vroom, vroom, vroom numbs us as well. But behind the action chaos is a powerful plea for love on a planet that’s forgotten how to nurture it. If Wachowski is “painting the sky with rainbows,” as one character puts it, she’s not doing so to deny real-world violence but to defy it. That gust of hope makes “The Matrix Resurrections” worth cheering."
74,SAV_Doc4_TheMatrixResurrections,SAV,Sci-Fi,Positive,The Matrix Resurrections,"After 22 years, Lana Wachowski returns to the Matrix – a simulation programme designed to deceive humans while their bodies are harvested in amniotic vats for energy. In 1999, Lana and her sister, Lilly, created a cinematic masterpiece that has since evolved and mutated into a branch of philosophy unto itself. From right-wing conspiracists to scholars of trans* theory, the Wachowskis’ authorial hold on The Matrix as a concept has largely slipped away.
A lot has changed for Lana and Lilly in the last two decades. After completing The Matrix trilogy, they co-directed several ever-expanding movie worlds, from Speed Racer to Jupiter Ascending, which felt like an auteurial sandbox for the pair. While they have their fans, most of these subsequent ventures have flopped at the box office and made a Wachowski project a precarious investment. Will their ideas fly and land safely, or will they fall flat on the pavement?
The process of gender transition both Wachowskis underwent during this period has invited reassessment of their early work. Of course, with The Matrix it’s all a matter of perspective – the blue pill thinkers may only just be catching on, but for those of us who took the red pill long before it was cool, the transness of these films has always been self-evident. It’s always been about seeing beyond the binary and unlocking the infinite possibilities offered in that space.
That’s where the fourth film, The Matrix Resurrections, starts off. We live in a blue pill society. Even Neo downs his blockers by the bottleful, shutting out the trauma of diving down the rabbit hole and, like Alice, accepting that it was just a dream. Readopting his dead name, Neo experiences the events of the first three films as flashbacks, receiving Cognitive Behavioural Therapy from his analyst, played by Neil Patrick Harris.
Like many artists, Neo has been projecting these elusive traumas into a video game called The Matrix, something akin to the MMORPG the Wachowskis created after the films to continue the story of Zion. It’s the game that made his name and that everyone knows him for, and after making three instalments, he’s been trying to develop an original game called ‘Binary’ that will take his ideas in a new direction.
These conversations at the start of the film simmer with self-knowing irony. Neo has a meeting with Smith, a version of Hugo Weaving’s arch-nemesis from the original films, now played menacingly by Jonathan Groff. He tells Neo that Warner Bros want him to go back to The Matrix, to develop what the fans want, leading to a montage of developer meetings mocking everything from ‘bullet time’ to guns and philosophical allusions set to the psychedelic soundtrack of ‘White Rabbit’ by Jefferson Airplane.
Coming from any other filmmaker, this could be cringe-inducing. But the Wachowskis are such private individuals, who rarely make any public comment on their personal lives or interpretations of their films, that this feels like a long pent-up final word. It’s hardly surprising that Lilly hasn’t wanted to be a part of this new film – she’s left it in the past, and if Neo’s experience is deliberately evocative of what the Wachowskis have been through, then it’s clearly required a lot of personal strength to dig up their past in this way.
The Matrix Resurrections is a heartbreaking depiction of the damage binary thinking can have, especially on trans* people. But it’s also a beautifully optimistic film which constantly affirms the reality of non-binaryness, and the improvement in quality of life breaking free from our social chains can have. No character is identical in the real world and in the Matrix – every aspect of gender presentation, such as hairstyle and clothing, differs for everyone, a form of switching explored much more explicitly now than it could have been at the turn of the century.
That doesn’t mean the blue-pill thinkers won’t have a great time with The Matrix Resurrections. It’s stunning to watch, a neon-infused matte finish crafted by cinematographers Daniele Massaccesi and John Toll that shows off the improved action choreography and special effects in exciting new ways. And while Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburne don’t reprise their roles as Smith and Morpheus (there are a hundred canonical reasons why which there simply isn’t space to delve into here), it’s a nostalgic delight to see Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss once again kicking sentinel butt.
But this isn’t a film for them, as much as they like to think the world was created for their benefit. Unlike the eye-rolling fan service of recent franchise reboots like Star Wars or Ghostbusters, no reference is made in The Matrix Resurrections without an essential narrative purpose. It’s such a rich and original tapestry of world expansion that it will no doubt be analysed as intensively as the original films by scholars for years to come. Once the premise is established, and Lana’s had her self-referential fun, buckle your seatbelts for something completely different.
Reeves and Moss are magnificent at resurrecting Neo and Trinity, and they blend exquisitely into Lana Wachowski’s matured style of filmmaking. It’s wonderful to see the influence of her interim projects on this one – David Mitchell, who wrote the novel Cloud Atlas and collaborated on the writing of the Wachowskis’ groundbreaking Netflix series Sense8, assisted with the screenplay along with Aleksandar Hamon. And their Cloud Atlas co-director and composer Tom Tykwer brings a lavish update to Don Davis’s score that heightens the film’s atmosphere at every turn.
Collaboration is an essential part of the Wachowskis’ filmmaking, and while Lilly isn’t present here, this isn’t a lone effort from Lana. There’s a unique warmth that permeates the screen of love for what everyone is doing, and their deep personal investment in this project seldom felt watching a blockbuster. That includes a smattering of Sense8 alumni, as well as Groff and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II who bring refreshing takes on their classic characters.
The Wachowskis love to celebrate newcomers, and Jessica Henwick is sublime as Captain Bugs. Having had a number of small roles in other franchises, her lead turn here keeps The Matrix feeling fresh and alive. The centring of female and non-binary characters in the film feels special and inspires so much hope for the future of cinema. As with all of her work, what Lana Wachowski has achieved in The Matrix Resurrections feels genuinely revolutionary."
75,SAV_Doc5_TheMatrixResurrections,SAV,Sci-Fi,Positive,The Matrix Resurrections,"The word that kept coming to mind while watching The Matrix Resurrections was “echo.” Not déjà vu — not the spooky sensation of having dreamt or lived something already without being able to account for when or where it happened. But echo: in which you know the origin, you can pinpoint the source, and yet here it comes, boomeranging back, somewhat the same as before, but also different. Distorted. 
A case in point: the return of familiar characters, like Morpheus and Mr. Smith — unforgettably played by Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving, respectively — but without those actors. (This is no spoiler; we’ve known since at least last year that Fishburne hadn’t been invited back for this sequel.) And a plot, meanwhile, that winkingly replays the story we already knew, almost beat by beat, with an awareness that only heightens the sense of revision. This is a movie that’s playing out in its own, disruptive present tense, looking back on its past self with curiosity and also skepticism. Unsurprisingly, this gets literalized: Minutes into the movie, a crew of familiar characters looks on from a distance as the opening scene of The Matrix replays itself… sort of. And throughout Resurrections, quick, cutting insertions of the previous Matrix movies jut their way into this new movie, sometimes in the form of memories, or maybe-hallucinations; other times grafted onto a literal screen, a torn curtain of sorts, like they’re a scene from a movie — which, so far as we’re concerned, is what they are.
Most ominously of all, we get the return of déjà vu itself, which was once a mere harbinger of some revision in the code of the so-called Matrix, a bit of cleverly conceptual world-building incited by the appearance of a black cat — less of an outright, midsequence info-dump than a brief pause in the action for a tiny info-leak, all of it whittled down into the form of a random animal. Now, in Resurrections, Déjà Vu is the name of an actual black cat. And that cat belongs to the therapist of Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves), a man recovering from a suicide attempt and very much still working through it. Anderson’s therapist wears glasses with bright blue rims — a singular, unmistakable blue, an unmissable echo retrieved from the franchise’s gnarled world of symbols and codes. An echo: the same, different. And consistent in this fact: It is a harbinger of something amiss in this world.
The Matrix Resurrections is a movie that knows you know its legacy — knows that the language and iconography of The Matrix (“red pill,” “bullet time,” “The Oracle,” “The One”) have seeped into the culture, into our minds, even if we somehow haven’t seen any of the previous movies. It also knows that this is the 21st century. Which means that much of what felt novel or prescient about the world of that first movie — with its allegorized, cyber-savvy world-within-worlds, its riffing on the idea of digital selves — has come to define human experience as we currently know it.
So an early scene in which Thomas Anderson and a woman named Tiffany (Carrie-Anne Moss) sit down to coffee works whether you know the significance of this encounter or not. Here are two people — he a famed game designer of a smash-hit called The Matrix; she a wife with three kids who, in her free time, loves riding and fixing up motorcycles — tiptoeing around the question of whether they know each other. Whether they’ve met before. Why it is that the heroine of the Matrix game, a cyber-creation named Trinity, looks so much like Tiffany. The emotional motor of the scene is this unspoken affinity, recognizable whether you know the backstory or not (or can remember the labyrinth of detail and philosophy that burdened the trilogy’s unfairly maligned, but still flawed, sequels). Likewise, the fact that the coffee shop itself is named not Stimulate, but “Simulatte,” is probably not lost on you. It’s seemingly all right there, right on the surface. Yet the sentiments it inspires in us, the audience, feel drawn from some deeper abyss.
It’s wonderful. It’s also how so much of the Wachowski universe — whether we’re talking about The Matrix and its offshoots or their other, more embattled, but equally fascinating subsequent projects — has tended to work. (Even in those cases where it doesn’t totally work). Lana Wachowski directed Resurrections alone, yet the juice — familiar from the siblings’ collaborative projects — remains that peculiar genius for mixing the sentimental and obvious with the subliminal, the hypersymbolic with the just-out-of-reach. And the central accomplishment of Resurrections is in how deftly, even movingly, it nails the chemistry of this mix. 
Resurrections opens with a gambit that should feel a little more tiresome. Suffice it to say, a franchise wrought of an explosion of seemingly binary ideas about choice (free will versus fate being the primary axis) and identity (whether “digital” or material) has already, as if by accident, set itself up for a late-coming sequel in which everything that came before is material for meta-reflection. Enter, again, Thomas Anderson: video-game designer — architect, you could say, of a game called The Matrix. Do I really need to proceed? Resurrection was co-written by Wachowski and novelists David Mitchell (whose Cloud Atlas the Wachowski sisters adapted back in 2012, with Halle Berry and Tom Hanks in tow) and Aleksandar Hemon, both of whom collaborated with the Wachowskis on the beloved Netflix series Sense8. So cleverness in the conceit is even more apparent now than it was in the first movie. The vibe of Resurrections is not so unlike the iconically playful opening of Wes Craven’s Scream 4, which practically shouted “We know you know how the story goes” — and then doubled, tripled, quadrupled-down on that knowledge with a nesting-doll nimbleness, a sense of humor about itself and about the fact of sequels, about our cynicism toward their utter non-necessity beyond making more money.
In Resurrections, as in Craven’s movie, Lana Wachowski doubles down and, similarly, wins us over with a pointed sense of intention. But the intention, here, is more of a mixed bag of sentiment. I’ll leave the finer details of the story to the movie. But much of what was built and sustained in the previous films — the utopia it imagined, the love made possible — is now gone. The new cast (headlined by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Jessica Henwick, Jonathan Groff, Neil Patrick Harris, Priyanka Chopra Jonas; with great additional work by the crew of the not-but-almost Nebuchadnezzar, played by Eréndira Ibarra, Max Riemelt, Brian J. Smith, Toby Onwumere) offers up a series of performances that play like avatars of those buried origins, just as Jada Pinkett Smith and Lambert Wilson (reprising their roles as Niobe and the Merovingian, respectively) signal just how much has changed since we last dove into this world. There are even Easter eggs, of a kind: for example, Chad Stahelski — the John Wick director who was once Keanu’s stunt double in The Matrix — makes an appearance here as “Handsome Chad” (the details of which are, like most things, better left unspoiled). 
I’ll give this much away: Abdul-Mateen plays a character named Morpheus, and very early on, the actor — who seems to be having the time of his life — playfully nods to Fishburne’s classic performance before setting up the entire movie to concede that there’s no neat return to the once-was. Time has passed. People have changed. Even Thomas Anderson.

In another, lesser movie, much of this would be easier to write off as fan service. I doubt either Wachowski is above that; their fans, even the fans who’ve misused their ideas, are crucial to the way their work has been sustained in the mainstream over time. But one of the wonderful turns of Resurrections is how thoughtfully it interrogates these bits of return. Thomas Anderson sits through business meetings in which his own work on The Matrix (the video game) gets repeated back to him by young, boardroom-creative types — because the company that owns his company, Warner Brothers (ahem), has demanded a sequel. And these young guns start mouthing off about what the originals “mean.” Crypto-fascism, they say. Trans politics, they say. Anderson becomes the frustrated artist who endures other peoples’ reads on his work: has the legacy of that work shouted back at him. 
It isn’t that those interpretations are wrong. The Matrix — the movie — absolutely speaks to its moment. It secured the sibling auteurs’ widespread cultural endurance in a late-Nineties culture exhausted by the promise of white-collar capital (see also: Office Space, released the same year) and furthermore sensitive to the steady leak of metal, data nerdery, and outsiderness into the postmodern mainstream. And it absolutely bears an essence that spoke to, still speaks to, the trans community, whose read on the movie as a digital-era trans allegory — in which people can shed their names and the embodied selves they present to the world in favor of exploring their gender identities online, from behind the relative safety of digital avatars — precedes, but was later validated by, Lilly making the trans metaphor explicit. (The character of Switch, it should be remembered, was conceived as a trans character. Warner Bros. nixed the idea.) And as for the dilemma of the “red pill” and what it now means — well, its salience cannot be denied. But nor can the irony, which speaks to the slippery capaciousness of what the Wachowskis pulled off, of seemingly opposing groups all latching onto the same metaphor to their own ends.
This is a lot of baggage for a sequel made two decades later to wrestle with. Rather than wrestle full-on, Wachowski has given us a movie that most astutely reminds us of something Lilly once said at the GLAAD Awards in 2016: “While the ideas of identity and transformation are critical components in our work, the bedrock that all ideas rest upon is love.” Resurrections is a love story — between Neo and Trinity, obviously. Resurrections plays like a spin on the preceding Matrix trilogy that could only have come on the heels of projects like Cloud Atlas and Jupiter Ascending, in which the Wachowskis leaned further and further into their loving strangeness, their woo-woo theatrics and sentimentality, their conceptual ambition. It is a Matrix movie that could only have come with twenty-plus years of hindsight — and insight. 
I was moved, impressed — far more than I expected to be. The emotional engineering of The Matrix Resurrections is exacting and rapturous. It initially feels corny. Then Jonathan Groff’s character, like Keanu’s, becomes who he “is,” and the hallucinations and denials of the movie’s early stretch have the veil ripped off. The fight scenes, even when they’re knowing rehashes, are finely tuned and psychologically astute for much of the movie — until the ending. Which is a rush of sincere feeling matched to handsomely choreographed action, bodies thrown asunder with the wave of a hand, others turned into sentient bombs. Like its predecessors, Resurrections has a way of imploding its multiple dimensions of meaning while also offering up a satisfying straight story. In the end, it all rests on a choice not unlike that which every character on the good side of this franchise’s fight has to face before delving into this other world. It’s a choice about who to be. It’s to the movie’s great credit that when the story tells you the fate of the world rests on this choice, more than ever before, you believe it."
76,SAV_Doc6_TheMatrixResurrections,SAV,Sci-Fi,Negative,The Matrix Resurrections,"It’s unusual for a series lasting four movies to follow the consistent downward trend evidenced by The Matrix cycle. The first movie, 1999’s The Matrix, started things off with a bang. Sadly, the first sequel, 2003’s The Matrix Reloaded, was merely ordinary. The conclusion of the original trilogy, 2003’s The Matrix Revolutions, was disappointing and bloated. Now, all these years later, along comes The Matrix Resurrections, and it proves to be not only a soulless attempt to exhume a buried franchise but a turgid slog. Perhaps the biggest surprise is that, given nearly two decades to develop and refine a narrative, this is the best they could come up with?
Having struggled through the seemingly endless 150-minute spectacle, I’m still not sure why it exists. The point seems to be to find a way to resurrect the two main characters who died in The Matrix Revolutions, Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss). There’s no rhyme or reason to a lot of what happens and, because it’s apparently possible to bring characters back to life, any potential suspense is effectively neutered. As eye candy, the action sequences retain some pizzaz but the “uniqueness” of their presentation has long since lost its flavor. The directorial stylings of Lana Wachowski (working without her previous partner, sister Lily) are largely indistinguishable from those of Michael Bay.
In the early going, The Matrix Resurrections offers some intriguing possibilities as it enters a meta rabbit hole. After a prologue that introduces a new character, Bugs (Jessica Henwick), and a new iteration of an old friend, Morpheus (now played by Yaha Abdul-Mateen II), we are reunited with Thomas Anderson (Reeves). We know he’s Neo but he doesn’t. He’s a game designer whose mega-successful, breakthrough trilogy, called The Matrix, has made him a geekdom celebrity. He’s in the process of designing a new game but he’s increasingly distracted by flashbacks. When he meets a woman, Tiffany (Carrie-Ann Moss), the connection is instantaneous. They feel they know one another, but the reason remains elusive.
Of course, it turns out that Thomas Anderson’s world is inside The Matrix. Neo and Trinity, who died at the end of the third movie, have been physically resurrected and exist in special pods. The movie never makes a compelling case why they couldn’t have been left dead. Of course, when Thomas starts to wake up and realize who he is (taking the red pill, of course), everyone inhabiting the Matrix suddenly wants him dead, including The Analyst (Neil Patrick Harris), whose seeming niceness makes him an effective megalomaniac. In a surprising twist reminiscent of Terminator 2, old nemesis Agent Smith (Jonathan Groff) has become an unexpected ally. This might have been more meaningful had Hugo Weaving returned. With a different face, Smith is as anonymous as his name suggests.
The ending represents one of the biggest, messiest, most incoherent orgies of meaningless special effects in any recent would-be blockbuster. I had no idea what was going on. Powers are gained (and lost) for no particular reason. Everything blows up. People fly (and fall). Neo throws his arms out in front of himself so often that it becomes comical. Perhaps I wasn’t paying close enough attention. Perhaps if I had been more invested, I would have understood. Perhaps the filmmakers should have given me a reason not to mentally check out before the halfway point.
Movies like this – continuations of long-dormant franchises that have gone dark for a good reason – should not be made. A few of them make money but most are ignored. Relying on nostalgia is an uncertain game as the makers of the latest iterations of Predator, Alien, and Ghostbusters (to name only a few) have learned. It takes more than bringing back Keanu Reeves (who is now better known as John Wick) and Carrie-Ann Moss (who has moved primarily to TV shows) to do the trick, and the gaping holes left by not featuring either Laurence Fishburne or Hugo Weaving (except in flashback clips) results in disappointment. Yaha Abdul-Mateen II and Jonathan Groff are imposters and we keep waiting for the real actors to make an appearance. They don’t, of course (Fishburne was never approached and Weaving had scheduling conflicts), and the possibilities offered by a true reunion are dashed.
After the release of The Matrix Revolutions, I wondered whether fans would have been better served by allowing the open-ended conclusion of The Matrix to stand. Now, two decades later, I’m certain that’s the case. Instead of enhancing the overall experience, expanding the universe, and extending the narrative, the sequels have proven that the sparks of creativity and originality evident in The Matrix were anomalies. The Matrix Resurrections is a waste of time and money. For fans of the series, it’s a betrayal that deserves to be ignored and forgotten as soon as possible."
77,SAV_Doc7_TheMatrixResurrections,SAV,Sci-Fi,Negative,The Matrix Resurrections,"Red pill or blue pill? Reality or illusion? 
When “The Matrix” debuted in 1999, those zeitgeist-y questions felt like reactions to our burgeoning tech anxiety. In addition to being a clever story and fun action movie, “The Matrix” reminded us that we needn’t be tethered to computers. That simulated realities can render us passive and oblivious. That we’re being exploited at the hands of suits and software.
More than two decades later, those messages seem at once hyper-relevant and hopelessly naive, particularly as the “redpill” symbolism, as it’s called, has been co-opted by the far right. That’s certainly not the franchise’s fault, and here it’s redeployed in good faith as the script explores the gray areas outside seemingly binary choices.
What hasn’t changed is the visual aesthetic of “The Matrix,” from its goth-lite costumes and weightless kung-fu throwdowns to its colorful cast and self-aware, big-picture concepts. It’s a pity so many of these come off as arbitrary in the sequel/reboot, “The Matrix Resurrections,” which arrives Dec. 22 in theaters and on HBO Max.
A charming, still-compelling Keanu Reeves returns as protagonist Neo, a.k.a. hacker-turned-messiah Thomas Anderson. He not only survived his apparent death at the end of 2003’s “The Matrix Revolutions,” but was plugged back into the grid and a meek programming job inside his simulated world, where the events of the first three films are downplayed as a video game trilogy.
Neo’s memories of it — and ours, as seen in flashbacks to previous movies — root the film in its pop-culture context and influence (see the good-hearted but hegemonic “Free Guy,” among countless others). When Neo’s mundane daily loop is intruded upon by strange dreams (memories and/or premonitions, of course) and the insights of his therapist (a delightfully sharp Neil Patrick Harris), he realizes reality isn’t what he thought — especially when a face from the past (Trinity, played by Carrie-Ann Moss) suddenly reconnects with Neo.
Neo’s boss in the Matrix (Jonathan Groff) also reveals himself to be the A.I. villain Smith, who’s got his own designs inside The Matrix. He joins a refreshed ensemble that includes an alternate, “modal” Morpheus — formerly Laurence Fishburne, and now the dashing Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. Jessica Henwick, who opens the movie as new character Bugs, is another welcome addition and the potential future of the franchise. Jada Pinkett Smith also returns, however weakly, as freedom-fighter-turned-leader Niobe.
Watching Neo evolve from reluctant to full-throated hero is familiar but satisfying, even as scenes feel disconnected from one another. The stark contrasts between the “real” future-apocalypse and the cozy, mindless Matrix renders the idea of rabbit holes moot, having already discovered the bottom.
The winks are constant, generating an awkward flow of meta references that are as thuddingly artless as they are shallow. You can feel director and co-creator Lana Wachowski straining against her corporate masters. The script’s mentions of parent company Warner Bros. aren’t potshots but product placement — and ones that might mean something if there weren’t so many Matrix callbacks in the Babel-tower of intellectual property known as “Space Jam: A New Legacy.”
It undermines the supposed universality of Io, the replacement city for the liberated people city of Zion. There, freed from their energy-harvesting pods and illusions, they inhabit an English-speaking steampunk paradise that will undoubtedly be invaded by evil robot Sentinels in later films. Lots of action-figure options here.
The interminable dialogue in “Resurrections” indicts social division, as animated by technology and media, and the sentient bots and zombie-like “sheeple” weaponized against noble causes. Tech-bros aren’t just jerks, they’re literally destructive entities. Office buildings, dingy apartments and alleys provide no respite from the onslaught of symbolic authority (cops, SWAT teams, Agents). Silhouettes and window/water-puddle reflections and mirrors are inescapable. “Get it?!” the movie constantly asks.
Trenchcoats, sunglasses and a numbing shower of point-blank, slow-mo shell casings also feel miscalculated, not so much cool-looking as depressingly rote. Like most fetishistic gun violence, they add little while smearing the momentum with chopped-up editing. Are there any actual life-or-death stakes here?
The plot of “Resurrections” is meant to dazzle and intrigue with a sense that it’s all a bit over their heads, and that certain questions won’t be answered for now. That’s both condescending and empty, a down payment on our future interest when we’ve barely engaged with this object.
The question isn’t whether this movie was necessary. It wasn’t. Like the second and third Matrix entries, it never justifies its existence beyond padding its parent’s pockets and bringing back familiar faces. It’s whether its interrogation of what’s genuine says anything useful or, at least, entertaining during this dark moment in U.S. history. It doesn’t."
78,SAV_Doc8_TheMatrixResurrections,SAV,Sci-Fi,Negative,The Matrix Resurrections,"""The Matrix Resurrections,"" the fourth chapter in the reality-bending sci-fi action series and the first in 18 long years, is a major malfunction, a confusing, muddled, painful meta-commentary on ""The Matrix"" wrapped up in a visually sluggish, directionless misfire. Say what you will about the ""Matrix"" movies — our collective memory has all but wiped the second and third chapters in the series from our mainframe, and rightfully so — but their action has never looked or moved so flatly.  
Writer-director Lana Wachowski, working for the first time without her sibling Lilly Wachowski, spends half of the movie wink-winking at ""The Matrix's"" place in pop-culture lore and the other half delving into a love story, with a whole lot of head-spinning blabbity-babble tying the two parts together.
Along the way, all the things expected out of a ""Matrix"" movie that once made the series a marvel of cyberpunk and techno-cool — the glitchy computer graphics, the kung-fu fight choreography, the gravity-defying and boundary-pushing action sequences, the black leather fetishism — feel dashed off or incomplete, like someone picked up the phone line while the dial-up internet was still connecting. Red pill or blue? Take whichever one gets this debacle over quicker. 
The immortal Keanu Reeves returns as Neo, but first off he's back to being Thomas Anderson, living in a staid reality where he's the creator of a wildly popular trilogy of groundbreaking video games called, you guessed it, ""The Matrix."" This series of films, er, video games shaped the way we looked at reality in the late '90s and early '00s, and now Warner Bros. (checked by name!) is looking to reboot the series to cash in on its popularity, with or without its lead designer. Basically, it's a whole lot of talking about the influence and radicalness of ""The Matrix,"" inside the realm of a ""Matrix"" movie. (Think of it as Lana Wachowski's version of ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare,"" the 1994 ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" entry where reality folded in on itself.) 
This alternate universe allows for exactly one good inside joke: a ""Matrix""-inspired franchise of coffee shops named Simulatte, complete with trickling black and green characters logo. (That's good — credit where credit's due.) It's at Simulatte where Thomas spots Tiffany (Carrie-Anne Moss), a mom with a couple of kids and a husband named Chad, to whom he has a connection he can't quite place his finger on. Before you can say, ""it's Trinity, bro!"" we're plucked back into the Matrix, the grungy world that's designed to look like the cold metal of a gun chamber that's ruled by machines who use humans as batteries, and the world as we know it is all a grand simulation.
Except things inside this Matrix aren't quite the same as they once were. Morpheus is now played by ""Candyman's"" Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, and it's not really explained why he's no longer in the form of Laurence Fishburne, who can currently be seen in Peacock's ""MacGruber"" series. (That's not to say Fishburne chose one project over the other, it's just to state plain facts of where Fishburne can and can't be seen.) And Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith is nowhere to be found, here Smith is played by ""Mindhunter's"" Jonathan Groff, and he's Thomas' boss at the video game company, cracking the whip on him to get going on that fourth installment.
A smarmy Neil Patrick Harris is on board as Thomas' therapist, known as the Analyst, and Christina Ricci — who starred in the Wachowski's ""Speed Racer"" — shows up for one scene and then never again. 
Bouncing around inside and outside of the Matrix, Wachowski liberally sprinkles footage from the previous films into the mix like a ""Rocky"" montage. (The old footage is sometimes meant to represent clips from the video games, which makes no sense.) 
The engine driving ""Resurrections"" is the reunion of Neo and Trinity, and the path to getting there involves at least one very long monologue by Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith), which might explain things if it wasn't so impossible to follow. 
Having navigated ""The Matrix"" through three previous installments, audiences know better now than to expect clear, concise plot lines from a ""Matrix"" film. (I'm still not even sure I have a firm grip on the first film, but I've got about 75-80% of it down.) But where earlier installments could be leaned on for cutting-edge action sequences — even the second chapter had that bananas freeway chase — the action here is mostly ho-hum, been-there-done-that recreations of earlier stunts. Even when characters run up and across walls and come back down to fell an opponent, which happens a lot here, it's nothing special, and it's never shot in a way that makes it a wow moment. It's mostly an ""oh, OK"" moment. (The wow moments never truly arrive, though the climax comes closest.)
It's not surprising that ""The Matrix Resurrections"" doesn't rewrite history or blow minds; the Wachowskis struggled even in 2003 to bring coherence to its follow-ups, and the team's most recent films — 2012's overblown ""Cloud Atlas"" and 2015's abysmal ""Jupiter Ascending"" — were large-scale disappointments. 
""Resurrections,"" though, is the first movie that finds Wachowski overtly looking back, and she reflects a potentially fraught relationship with the series and its success. It's as if she's writing off ""The Matrix,"" and she makes it all too easy to join her. ""Resurrections"" is a hard crash back into reality. "
79,SAV_Doc9_TheMatrixResurrections,SAV,Sci-Fi,Negative,The Matrix Resurrections,"Complicated in the best of times, ""The Matrix Resurrections"" is simply convoluted, a collection of flashy digits that don't add up to much of anything. Although director/co-writer Lana Wachowski slyly comments on the commercial nature of the undertaking and it's nice seeing Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss reunited, the better plan in hindsight might have been to completely reboot the system.
Instead, Wachowski has conjured a film that falls into its own kind of strange nether realm, mixing nostalgia and self-referential callbacks with what feels like a redo of fundamental elements, without satisfactorily explaining (despite scads of exposition) how we got from the earlier trilogy to here. Although the previous ""Matrix"" sequels marked a steep decline from the freshness of the original, compared to this film's missteps all is forgiven.
Spoilers are understandably a concern with this sort of eagerly anticipated genre movie, but the one benefit of ""Resurrections"" is that it's not entirely clear what there is to spoil.
As the trailer has revealed, some time has passed, and Neo/Thomas Anderson (Reeves) has moved on, while Moss' Trinity harbors no memory of him. Clearly, there's been a glitch in the program, one that will require drawing him back into the previous worlds he occupied and introducing characters to function as his guides.
The principal additions are Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as a new version of Morpheus, Jessica Henwick (""Iron Fist""), Jonathan Groff and Neil Patrick Harris, with Groff enjoying perhaps the juiciest of those parts and clearly relishing it. Wachowski has also included several cast members from her Netflix series ""Sense8"" in smaller roles.
At its core ""The Matrix"" has always been anchored by its grand love story, with Trinity's faith (assisted by prophecy) having helped Neo embrace his messiah-like destiny. While that remains, the film is so chaotic even their storyline proves uninvolving through no fault of the stars.
So, what's left? The stylized action, stunt work and look, which felt more distinctive way back in 1999. While there are a few visually striking moments, those sequences are offset by puzzling ones, like a massive close-quarters fight that makes it difficult to discern who's doing what to whom, blunting any excitement.
The film actually conjures its most memorable elements relatively early, which includes an amusingly meta reference to the nature of sequels and even to Warner Bros., which is releasing the movie (and like CNN, a unit of WarnerMedia). That dialogue sounds almost apologetic, and it takes on a different meaning after absorbing the film in its entirety and realizing how uninspired the whole exercise feels.
""I'm back where I started,"" Neo says, sounding as mystified as he did when Morpheus opened his eyes the first time, while perhaps inadvertently summing up one of the structural flaws.
Yes, reboots and revivals are inevitable, and more than most, any ""Matrix"" sequel was likely to be polarizing. Still, that first rush of enthusiasm can ebb quickly, which is what happens here. Because while ""Resurrections"" again offers a choice between the red pill and blue pill, the one thing that won't be necessary -- especially for those choosing the home-viewing option -- is a sleeping pill."
80,SAV_Doc10_TheMatrixResurrections,SAV,Sci-Fi,Negative,The Matrix Resurrections,"When George Lucas chose to prolong his Star Wars trilogy with 1999’s The Phantom Menace, he did so with the knowledge that there was intense fan demand and, crucially, more story to tell. That’s not the case with The Matrix series, whose original (premiering the same year as Lucas’ prequel, and stealing much of its thunder) remains hugely influential for its bullet-time effects and red pill simulation-theory fantasy, but whose severely underwhelming sequels ended both its tale and widespread franchise interest.
Thus, The Matrix Resurrections (Dec. 22, in theaters and on HBO Max) arrives on a wave of middling excitement due to a lack of perceived purpose. As it turns out, there’s good reason for that attitude: devoid of its trademark style, action and depth, it’s a pointless follow-up that falls back on cheeky self-referentiality in order to justify its existence.
Most of The Matrix Resurrections’ meta shenanigans are confined to its early going, highlighted by corporate bigwig Smith (Jonathan Groff) explaining to his game-designer business partner Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) that Warner Bros is going to make a fourth installment in their hit The Matrix video game series with or without their participation, so they may as well get on board with the project. Anderson’s video game smash is, as one might expect from this set-up, based on the events of the first three Matrix movies, although we never see the actual interactive title; instead, it’s depicted as literal scenes from the cinematic works of Lana and Lilly Wachowski. No matter. What’s front-and-center during these initial passages is game developers dissecting the many things (bullet-time, metaphors, ultra-violence) that made the franchise so popular in the first place.
This plays as more gratingly cutesy than clever, but at least it adds a temporary new wrinkle to a well-worn template. As directed solely by Lana Wachowski (who co-wrote the script with David Mitchell and Aleksandar Hemon), The Matrix Resurrections wants to play with the nature of Anderson’s reality, which he himself is struggling with, mainly in therapy sessions with an analyst (Neil Patrick Harris) that focus on a prior suicide attempt born from his guiding belief that The Matrix is less a product of his imagination than a memory. As if that weren’t enough of a mystery for the film to spin, it also presents us with a prologue vision of a badass named Bugs (Jessica Henwick) who, while in the Matrix, has a run-in with an agent (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) that leads them to Anderson’s old apartment. In the blink of an eye, Abdul-Mateen II’s character is revealed to be Morpheus, the true-believer played by Laurence Fishburne in the initial trilogy. But even that’s not quite right; talk of modals and programming imply he’s some sort of synthetic variation on Fishburne’s guru.
The Matrix Resurrections moves at a blistering clip from the start, and there’s some exhilaration to be had from being bombarded with names, faces, facts and scenarios that feel like alternate-universe takes on bedrock Matrix material. Yet beneath its bewildering surface, Wachowski’s film remains a predictable contraption predicated on the unavoidable fact that Anderson really is Neo, and that he’s somehow found himself re-imprisoned in the Matrix by Earth’s machine overlords. How that scenario came to be—given that Neo apparently died at the end of The Matrix Revolutions—isn’t explained until much later into the two-and-a-half-hour runtime. More frustrating, though, is that the answer to this question is handled as hastily as everything else in this muddled saga, which has a fondness for explaining convoluted post-Revolutions events with great big gobs of semi-coherent exposition.
Anderson eventually embraces his inner Neo, thereby facilitating the film’s trips to the “real world,” where humans now live in a giant metropolis that’s far more advanced than their previous safe haven Zion. As before, every time The Matrix Resurrections departs the Matrix for this grim mecha-planet, all traces of wonder, liveliness and thrills promptly vanish; the best that can be said about red-pilled humanity is that it appears to have gotten over the impulse to stage embarrassing cave raves. Thankfully, Neo spends less time in this realm—which is overseen by a familiar face in so-so old-age makeup—than he does partnering with Bugs and her crew on a mission to free Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) from enslavement. This requires unhooking her from her gooey hose chamber as well as opening her eyes in the Matrix, where she’s living as a wife and mother whom Anderson semi-stalks at a coffee shop called, wink-wink, Simulatte.
While some of this might have read as crafty on the page, in practice, The Matrix Resurrections is an unwieldy beast that itself has forgotten what made its sci-fi reverie unique and captivating in the first place. From Bugs (who’s named after the Looney Tunes bunny), to the sound of Jefferson Airplane’s “White Rabbit,” to the sight of an Alice in Wonderland book—not to mention the literal looking-glass portals through which Neo and company now leap (phones are so 1999)—Wachowski hammers home her allusions. She does likewise with her thematic preoccupations with binaries (free will and destiny, fact and fiction, conscious and unconscious, desire and fear) and with the overarching notion that stories become real when they profoundly stir one’s heart and mind. These elements aren’t dramatized as much as bluntly articulated in between fleet martial-arts skirmishes and massive shootouts, and they strain to lend these proceedings a modicum of import.
In the process, The Matrix Resurrections ditches just about everything iconic about the franchise. Gone are the elaborately and immaculately choreographed combat set pieces, here replaced by borderline-incoherent herky-jerky action punctuated by a plethora of slow-motion shots. Even more sorely missed is Hugo Weaving’s overly enunciating Agent Smith, the embodiment of the entire affair’s evil, as well as a measure of truly momentous dramatic stakes. While Groff and Harris do their best to put new twists on well-known figures, they—like everything in this unnecessary sequel—come across as wan facsimiles rather than rousing upgrades. Reprising their famous roles, Reeves and Moss are at least able to rekindle a bit of the romantic spark they once shared. Alas, for the most part, they’re envisioned not as complex flesh-and-blood heroes but as pawns for Wachowski’s whirligig wannabe-philosophical mayhem. Incapable of vitally expanding the series’ ideas and form, it’s a film that’s less the one than a zero."
81,LHM_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbeanTheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,LHM,Action,Positive,Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"In Graham Greene's novel The Heart of the Matter, Major Scobie invents a story for a young boy in hospital about ""a peculiarly ferocious lot of pirates who haunted the West Indies"". The nominal hero works for the British Government; the ""real heroes"", though, are the pirates. The boy laps it up; as does the anguished young woman in the bed beside him. Both enjoy the bit about lieutenant Batty Davis - ""so called because of his insane rages when he would send a whole ship's crew to the plank"".
Like Scobie, the writers behind Pirates of the Caribbean know how to amuse the afflicted - the disease, in our case, being a helpless need to catch the latest, wham-blam summer hit. That Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (both of whom worked on Shrek) have had to spin their story out of a Disneyland theme ride may strike some as an insurmountable hurdle (the ride takes 14 minutes; the film lasts 143). That their director is Gore Verbinski - responsible for last year's oafish remake of The Ring - may appal others. And yet, during the film's middle stretch at least, Pirates does the trick, harrying us through a breakneck tour of smoking ships, cobwebbed rigging, moonlight X-rays and one man's hurdy-gurdy grin. Set against the robotic tail-chasing of Charlie's Angels 2 or the dry, angst of Hulk, its roiling, liquid energy connects like a slap to the face.
Which is not to say that the plot is straightforward. Meet pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), ex-Cap'n of the Black Pearl. Jack's mutinous crew, led by pizza-faced, monkey-stroking Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), left Jack to die on a desert island so they could plunder a treasure chest of Aztec gold. But the jokes on them - the moolah was cursed and, d'oh, they've now joined the ranks of the undead. Knowing nothing of this, Jack arrives in British-controlled Port Royal. He wants to win back the Pearl, and thinks the HMS Interceptor, reputedly the ""fastest ship in the army's fleet"", can help him do it.
But wait, there's more... in the corsetted shape of pouty young Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), all set to marry poker-up-his-bum naval official, Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport). Instead, she tumbles into the drink, only to be rescued by Jack. And kidnapped almost immediately afterwards, by Barbossa's gang of ghouls. Desperate to get her back, Ms Swann's blacksmith beloved, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) joins forces with Sparrow and purloins the Interceptor. Will, it transpires, is the son of a Black Pearl pirate. Indeed, he holds the key to unlocking the Aztec curse. But can he trust Jack, or will the buccaneer prove a law unto himself?
Amidst this early confusion, Depp initially seems the most tiresome element of all. From Benny & Joon on down, the actor has long shown a penchant for these kind of ""counter-culture"" parts (pale freaks, tanned Gypsies - so long as they don't work in a bank, they're alright with Johnny).
Also horribly familiar is Depp's Brechtian, punkish desire to alienate us from the action, his determination to signal - via camp pouts, wacky accents, whimsical walks and childlike hand wiggling - that all is illusion (only Helena Bonham Carter, that other supremely self-conscious gothic babe, can out-do him at this game). Poor Depp. He's apparently unaware that what he mostly offers is a lifestyle model for wealthy slummers. Chocolat, anyone?
The shock is that in Pirates, at long last, someone calls his bluff. Halfway through the film, Orlando Bloom's blacksmith wonders aloud if undue exposure to the sun has made Jack Sparrow the way he is. He then mimics the pirate's dazed and confused posturing - in the process, nailing Depp's ""act"", too. Apparently, this scene was Bloom's idea, and it's a masterstroke. Tired of watching the elaborate show, he takes a poke at this pretentious clown; and with that battle won we, the Johnny-haters in the audience, are finally able to relax and get swept along.
Whether by chance or no, Jack's dialogue shows an instant improvement. In fact, his moral slipperiness becomes one of the film's chief pleasures. Whether trying to nuzzle Elizabeth when they're stranded together on an island, or flirting with Barbossa over the cursed gold, he gains a proper, sharp edge. Ultimately, Sparrow's what you might call a swinger - with just a dash of couch potato thrown in. Watching another miscreant get short-shrift from the authorities, he whispers cheerily: ""I want you to know, I was rooting for you."" Later, he reassures Elizabeth that, ""It would never have worked between us!"", and it's only half a joke. Errol Flynn's Captain Blood won the heart of a lady, not to mention a pardon from the government. Nothing with Jack is as clear-cut.
As played by Rush, Barbossa is almost as good - a riff on Peter Pan's Captain Hook, similarly sneery and time-obsessed. The other delight is Mackenzie Crook (Gareth from The Office), as Ragetti, one of the Black Pearl's barely human, ghastly-by-moonlight crew. Just looking at his face (already cadaverous and opal-pale) makes you smile. That, and the thought of him back in Gareth mode, telling his colleagues about life on a flash Hollywood set. On screen, he suffers a la Blackadder's Baldrick, noting of his false wooden eye that it ""splinters something terrible"". Off screen, you can all but hear him confiding: ""No offence to Mr Depp, but he wouldn't last five minutes in the territorial army...""
And so we leave the cinema happy, our heads full of Gareth and gangsters-at-sea. Context, of course, is all. Looked at from one angle, Pirates is worryingly similar to Martin Scorsese's woeful Gangs of New York. Glossy, bloated, phonily feminist and class-war-lite, they even share the same trope - ie a talisman, passed on from slain father to handsome, conflicted son. But where Gangs thought it was profound, Pirates harbours no such delusion. Bill the Butcher would make a perfect Disneyland dummy (roll up, roll up, let Bill take aim with his trusty knife) but I'm sure Daniel Day Lewis doesn't see it that way; Depp, by contrast, appears to have embraced middle-brow spectacle. What's the betting he's already signed up for the sequel?
Graham Greene saw Jack coming - the full-blown hero pirate; not a foil, not a do-gooder-in-disguise, but an extraordinary, decent criminal; equally naughty and nice. It barely matters that Greene's own film creations were more brutal (see that most indecent of pirates, Harry Lime). Engrossed in his own dark thoughts, Greene tossed a little revelation our way: sometimes the anguished world needs a bed-time story - one that children of all ages can enjoy."
82,LHM_Doc2_PiratesOfTheCaribbeanTheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,LHM,Action,Positive,Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"Year after year, lazy poster quotes try to convince audiences that the latest blockbuster movie is ""a rollercoaster ride"". Pirates Of The Caribbean does, in actual fact, have its roots in a theme park attraction — a slow-moving boat trip past richly detailed tableaux of lusty buccaneers and skeletons who breathed their last grasping for forbidden treasure; not the most likely base material to turn into cinema gold. But producer Jerry Bruckheimer proves yet again that he's a big-screen alchemist where sheer entertainment is concerned. Pirates Of The Caribbean is, without a doubt, the best blockbuster of the summer.
Director Gore Verbinski steers his ship through choppy commercial waters by keeping the romance, adventure and comedy on an even keel. If there's the slightest niggle to be had, it's probably that the swashbuckling sequences don't really lay down a challenge to the Zorros or Robin Hoods. But such cares are swept aside by a rollicking tale of pirate lore, with cursed treasure, secret identities and enough acts of betrayal and loyalty to keep the final showdown as sparky as the firecrackers in Blackbeard's whiskers.
It's also very funny. Shrek writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio spice up the pirate genre as gamely as they did fairy tales; but on the comedy map it's Johnny Depp's inspired turn as Captain Jack Sparrow that really marks the spot. Depp, arguing that pirates were the rock stars of their day, models his entire performance on Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones: it's there in every slurred vowel and every drug-fried wiggle of the head. There's an endearing dignity to Sparrow's hunger for fame. ""You are, without doubt, the worst pirate I've heard of,"" says one British officer. ""Yes,"" replies Jack, ""but you have heard of me."" Gloriously over-the-top, this performance is pitched only as high as the film's fun factor itself. In terms of physical precision and verbal delivery, it's a masterclass in comedy acting.
Depp steals the show, but leaves some plunder for Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, surely the sexiest young couple in British cinema — nay, the world. Orlando plays it straight but gets the girl; and if you think Keira looks good in a dress, wait until you see her running around in redcoat and breeches.
Others clearly having a ball while gigging in the rigging include Geoffrey Rush with his panto Captain Hook routine, and CG-eyed pirate Mackenzie Crook (from The Office). Without a previous formula to adhere to or franchise to maintain (the spin-off ride exists already), Pirates revels in its freedom to do its own thing. That said, its adventure style is indebted to the likes of Raiders Of The Lost Ark and The Mummy in its mix of matinée action and horror that won't send the kids shrieking from the room.
The ghostly figures on the Black Pearl are cursed to sail the seas in a state between living and dead. When they step into full moonlight, their rotting flesh and bones become visible adding a delightful shiver to proceedings. Best of all, Pirates is a film that prides itself on lively detail and top-grade craftsmanship, but doesn't take itself too seriously. That's a lesson that nearly every one of its blockbuster rivals would do well to take on board. Audiences aren't cajoled into feeling that they should be having fun; they simply are having fun because the movie is too."
83,LHM_Doc3_PiratesOfTheCaribbeanTheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,LHM,Action,Positive,Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"Having already played the greatest lover of all time, Don Juan de Marco, Johnny Depp now sets his sights on the second in line: Pepé Le Pew. In recent interviews, Depp has admitted to channeling two outsized personalities in his efforts to portray the rogue pirate Captain Jack Sparrow – the aforementioned animated skunk and Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards – and, indeed, the paw prints of both are all over Depp’s gleefully audacious performance. Raccoon-eyed, gold-toothed, and swinging with shoulder-length dreads like a weeping willow tree, Depp delivers his lines with the languor of an amiably stoned rock star, more swishy than swashbuckling, and the result is an absolute gas. Had Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl no other attributes, the sheer spectacle of Depp would be worth the cost of admission, but shockingly, his cheeky performance is just one bit of a booty bursting with goodies. What could have been a two-hour-long advert for a Disney theme-park ride (the, er, source material for the film) is in fact a rollicking adventure yarn, the most perfect realization of the ""summer movie"" to float down the pike in a good long while. Depp’s Captain Jack is a disgraced pirate, the victim of a mutiny that left him stranded on an island and his beloved ship, The Black Pearl, the property of an especially unsavory bunch led by Captain Barbossa (Rush). The renegade pirates happily pillage an Aztec treasure, but that booty comes with a curse that has doomed them to a life, as it were, of being undead. To reverse the curse, they must hunt down a gold medallion now hanging from the neck of the noble Elizabeth (Knightley), a fair maiden with some surprisingly forward-thinking ideas about corsets and classless love – the last one especially handy, given her crush on a humble blacksmith named Will Turner (Bloom). To cut to the quick: The pirates nab Elizabeth, and Jack and Will team up to get their bonnie lasses – Elizabeth and The Black Pearl – back. Pirates of the Caribbean has a blast getting to the big showdown, berthing periodically for some very scary set-pieces with the undead pirates (in moonlight, they turn in to impressively computer-generated skeletons), a cleverly choreographed swordsmen duel, and the kind of cracklingly corny dialogue you’d expect from a buddy flick. Buddies Will and Jack become, but everybody knows you can’t trust a pirate – especially one who looks like he might burst into a guitar solo at the drop of a (pirate’s) hat – and Jack’s shameless conniving provides the film with some very fun twists. Director Gore Verbinski has proven in his brief career to be a jack of all trades, hopping from children’s fare (Mouse Hunt) to screwball comedy (The Mexican) to horror (The Ring) in a few short years. Here, he brings the best of each of those genres to yet another – the swashbuckler. Verbinski fully commits to the inherent hokeyness of the genre, backed by über-producer Jerry Bruckheimer. With a résumé littered with such disposables as Con Air, Coyote Ugly, Pearl Harbor, and Kangaroo Jack, Bruckheimer – always eager to egg on the public’s thirst for bigger, louder, stupider – has done a scandalous amount of damage to contemporary cinema, but for once, his dubious talent for big-buck bombast is exploited for good rather than evil. Sympathy for the devil, indeed."
84,LHM_Doc4_PiratesOfTheCaribbeanTheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,LHM,Action,Positive,Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"There's a nice little 90-minute B movie trapped inside the 143 minutes of ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" a movie that charms the audience and then outstays its welcome. Although the ending leaves open the possibility of a sequel, the movie feels like it already includes the sequel; maybe that explains the double-barreled title. It's a good thing that Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp are on hand to jack up the acting department. Their characters, two world-class goofballs, keep us interested even during entirely pointless swordfights.
Pointless? See if you can follow me here. Capt. Jack Sparrow (Depp) has a deep hatred for Capt. Barbossa (Rush), who led a mutiny aboard Sparrow's pirate ship, the Black Pearl, and left Capt. Jack stranded on a deserted island. Barbossa and his crew then ran afoul of an ancient curse that turned them into the Undead. By day they look like normal if dissolute humans, but by the light of the moon, they're revealed as skeletal cadavers. Now here's the important part: Because they're already dead, they cannot be killed. Excuse me for supplying logic where it is manifestly not wanted, but doesn't that mean there's no point in fighting them? There's a violent battle at one point between the Black Pearl crew and sailors of the Royal Navy, and unless I am mistaken the sailors would all eventually have to be dead because the skeletons could just keep on fighting forever, until they won. Yes? The only reason I bring this up is that the battle scenes actually feel as if they go on forever. It's fun at first to see a pirate swordfight, but eventually it gets to the point where the sword-clashing, yardarm-swinging and timber-shivering get repetitious. I also lost count of how many times Jack Sparrow is the helpless captive of both the British and the pirates, and escapes from the chains/brig/noose/island.
And yet the movie made me grin at times, and savor the daffy plot, and enjoy the way Depp and Rush fearlessly provide performances that seem nourished by deep wells of nuttiness. Depp in particular seems to be channeling a drunken drag queen, with his eyeliner and the way he minces ashore and slurs his dialogue ever so insouciantly. Don't mistake me: This is not a criticism, but admiration for his work. It can be said that his performance is original in its every atom. There has never been a pirate, or for that matter a human being, like this in any other movie. There's some talk about how he got too much sun while he was stranded on that island, but his behavior shows a lifetime of rehearsal. He is a peacock in full display.
Consider how boring it would have been if Depp had played the role straight, as an Errol Flynn or Douglas Fairbanks (Sr. or Jr.) might have. To take this material seriously would make it unbearable. Capt. Sparrow's behavior is so rococo that other members of the cast actually comment on it. And yet because it is consistent and because you can never catch Depp making fun of the character, it rises to a kind of cockamamie sincerity.
Geoffrey Rush is relatively subdued--but only by contrast. His Barbossa, whose teeth alone would intimidate a congregation of dentists, brings gnashing to an art form.
Only the film's PG-13 rating prevents him from doing unthinkable things to the heroine, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), whose blood, it is thought, can free the captain and his crew from the Curse of the Black Pearl.
Elizabeth is the daughter of Weatherby Swann, the governor (Jonathan Pryce) of Port Royal, a British base in the Caribbean, and seems destined to marry Cmdr. Norrington (Jack Davenport), a fate which we intuit would lead to a lifetime of conversations about his constipation.
She truly loves the handsome young swordsmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), whom she met when they were both children, after spotting him adrift on a raft with a golden pirate medallion around his neck, which turns out to hold the key to the curse. Jack Sparrow takes a fatherly interest in young Turner, especially when he discovers who his father was ... and that is quite enough of the plot.
Bloom is well cast in a severely limited role as the heroic straight-arrow. He has the classic profile of a silent-film star. Knightley you will recall as the best friend of the heroine in ""Bend It Like Beckham,"" where she had a sparkle altogether lacking here.
Truth be told, she doesn't generate enough fire to explain why these swashbucklers would risk their lives for her, and in closeup, seems composed when she should smolder. Parminder K. Nagra, the star of ""Beckham,"" might have been a more spirited choice.
""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is ""based on"" the theme park ride at Disney World, which I have taken many times. It is also inspired (as the ride no doubt was) by the rich tradition of pirate movies, and excels in such departments as buried treasure, pirates' caves, pet parrots and walking the plank, although there is a shortage of eye patches and hooks.
The author Dave Eggers reportedly plans to open a Pirates' Store, complete with planks measured and made to order, and ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" plays like his daydreams."
85,LHM_Doc5_PiratesOfTheCaribbeanTheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,LHM,Action,Positive,Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"For those taking a global view of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, it's very easy to be cynical. This is, after all, cross-promotion at its most blatant. What could be more marketable that one of Disney's most popular theme park attractions? The name recognition is already in place - all that's necessary to complete the puzzle is a story that will fit the ride. But there are two reasons why jaded ranting isn't the best way to proceed with this review. In the first place, no one really cares. And, more importantly, this is actually an entertaining experience.
Pirates of the Caribbean is good, but not great. Swashbuckling adventures are few and far between these days, so it's a pleasant surprise to see one that is competently made. To add to the enjoyment, the movie never takes itself too seriously. If there wasn't so much action, it would be tempting to classify the production as a comedy. Alas, Pirates of the Caribbean runs for a good 30 minutes too long (the protracted battles with the undead, who cannot be killed, become repetitive), and the denouement is on the weak side. Taken as a whole, however, the movie represents solid fun. A word of caution to parents, however: the PG-13 rating is an indicator that certain elements of the movie are not for younger children. Proceed carefully with sensitive under-11 children.
Cap'n Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is a pirate who's infamous for his ineptitude. After rescuing a damsel, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), he finds himself being thanked by her father (Jonathan Pryce) and her would-be betrothed (Jack Davenport) while simultaneously being arrested for piracy. He escapes, but, after losing a duel with the heroic blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who pines for Elizabeth, he is sent back to jail. However, when the town comes under attack by the pirate ship Black Pearl, and its blackguard of a captain, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), kidnaps Elizabeth, Will springs Jack from prison so the pirate can help him retrieve his beloved. But Barbossa isn't interested in a ransom. He and his crew are cursed to walk the Earth as the living dead until a blood sacrifice can restore their humanity.
As was true with director Gore Verbinski's previous outing, The Ring, Pirates of the Caribbean oozes atmosphere. The humor keeps it from becoming too creepy, but there are still a few chills to be had. I was in some ways reminded of Sam Raimi's Army of Darkness, where there were lots of skeletons marching around, some of which were acting like the Three Stooges. Verbinski gets huge assists from cinematographer Dariusz Wolski and composer Klaus Badelt, who is responsible for one of 2003's few memorable musical scores. And, of course, we get to hear a few refrains of the memorable Pirates of the Caribbean anthem: ""Yo ho! Yo ho! A pirate's life for me!""
Pirates of the Caribbean belongs to Johnny Depp. Keira Knightley (now a familiar face in the wake of Bend It Like Beckham) and Orlando Bloom (The Lord of the Rings' Legolas, sans ears and blond hair) make a cute couple, and Geoffrey Rush is typically over-the-top as the bad guy, but the star of every scene is Depp. With several gold teeth in his mouth and beads in his hair, Depp plays the part with an engaging goofiness that sets the movie's tone. In one scene, Sparrow becomes blind drunk, but his behavior isn't all that different from when he's sober - a clear indicator of where Depp elected to take the character. Sparrow is a rogue through-and-through, and, although he may have a heart of gold, it's definitely tarnished. Take away Depp, and you're left with a derivative and dull motion picture.
As is mandated by the first rule of summer movies - sustain the action - Pirates of the Caribbean is wall-to-wall battles, chases, and fights. The only pauses are those necessitated by the need to advance the plot through exposition. There's lots of swordplay, including a lengthy and memorable struggle between Sparrow and Will. It's probably the best example of cinematic swordfighting since The Mask of Zorro. (It doesn't come close to the clash between Wesley and Inigo Montoya in The Princess Bride. In that movie, the actors did their own fencing. Here, it's clear from the obscuring camera angles that stunt performers were involved.) For those who are familiar with the amusement park attraction, most of the key scenes are included (although the hairy leg is missing), emphasizing the movie's tie-in nature. And, if you're dying to see another Disneyworld/Disneyland ride turned into a cinematic endeavor, there's hardly any wait at all - The Haunted Mansion is due out at Thanksgiving. Personally, I can't wait for Space Mountain."
86,LHM_Doc6_PiratesOfTheCaribbeanTheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,LHM,Action,Negative,Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"Oh, the irony! For years, movies have been getting faster and dumber, trying to keep ahead of computer games by becoming like theme-park rides.
Theme parks in turn fed off these movies, basing new rides on them, the dog chasing its tail.
Now Disney gives us the first movie based on a theme-park attraction - the venerable pirate ride at Disneyland - and it turns out to be slow and somewhat dull, as if it's trying to be something other than a good ride.
This pirate movie runs 143 minutes. It has about six endings before the blessed final one. If ever a movie called for speed and action, this is it, but Gore Verbinski (The Mexican) thinks he's doing Lord of the Rings on the Spanish Main.
Avast, ye scurvy scum and bring me the precious! Instead of a ring, the object of desire is a gold medallion minted by the Aztecs, but it functions the same way. A sword was definitely needed, but in the cutting room.
There's a reasonable movie buried in all the carry-on, but it's hardly a drama. The filmmakers think they can make it one by drawing it out. It's as if Verbinski is making two movies - one is a swashbuckler mixed with a ghost story, laced with humour and violent action.
The other is a bore - a love story between a headstrong and high-born beauty and a lowly swordsmith who doesn't know he's the son of a pirate. Both of them are gorgeous, of course, in an upper-class English sort of way, two youthful swans played by Keira Knightley (from Bend It Like Beckham) and Orlando Bloom (from Lord of the Rings). They don't generate much heat though, because the script has too many balls in the air.
There are three plot streams vying for our attention most of the time and each requires considerable screen time. The strategy is to spread the story out, to maximise demographic appeal. If you don't like this, maybe you'll like that, but this turns it into a film with no centre - a movie by committee. It's the kind of script you might see in any of the tired Disney traditional animations of recent years, and the writers do come from the Mouse workhouse.
Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio wrote Disney's Aladdin and consulted on Antz and Sinbad, but they also wrote Shrek, for DreamWorks, the computer animation that showed the way forward. Pirates ... has some of the charm and humour of that film, but too much of the old dead hand of Disney, too.
It's clear that Verbinski was trying to avoid the conventional, by the casting of Johnny Depp. The extent to which he succeeds is the extent to which the story stays focused on him.
Depp gives one of the oddest performances of his career as Captain Jack Sparrow, a working-class English buccaneer who's picaresque but shipless. He appears first at Port Royal, Jamaica, on the mast of a modest vessel that's sinking. He looks like a Rastaman, his hair braided and baubled with trinkets; his intelligent eyes are ringed with kohl. His walk is foppishly jaunty and his speech slurred, as though he's permanently pickled. The accent is a reasonable working-class London drawl.
Depp has said that he based his act on Keith Richard, reasoning that pirates in 1750 were the rock stars of their day, but there are moments when I thought he might have been channelling Ozzy Osbourne as well.
Whatever he's doing, it's hard to take your eyes off him - until he comes up against a world-class scenery chewer like Geoffrey Rush.
Our Geoffrey has the biggest hat and the worst teeth in the movie, as Captain Barbossa, the mutinous dog who stole Sparrow's ship, the Black Pearl. He commands a crew of blackguards with faces like death; that's because they are dead, or undead, cursed by the missing Aztec gold to wander the seas until the medallion is found. When the moon is full, they turn into computer-generated skeletons and the movie gets turned over to the byte counters and the machines that ate Hollywood.
The first 10 fights between the living and the undead may entertain, but these buccaneers do literally go on forever. They can't be killed, which somewhat takes the shine off the combat. All told, for me, the film's treasures remained resolutely buried."
87,LHM_Doc7_PiratesOfTheCaribbeanTheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,LHM,Action,Negative,Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is an amusement park ride at Disneyland, and now it's a movie based on the ride. Is this a sign of the apocalypse? No, but it does suggest a dearth of inspiration and portends a movie made up entirely of surfaces, filled with air -- a shell game with all shells and no pea.
That's about the size of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" (subtitled ""The Curse of the Black Pearl""), though the filmmakers run with the concept farther than might be expected. The sneering comic villainy of Geoffrey Rush, the boy-cake appeal of Orlando Bloom and some of Johnny Depp's most successful character work in years keep this ship afloat for most of its running time. But eventually the concept buckles under the heavy blockbuster treatment, becoming a monotonous, repetitive spectacle of endless shipboard sword fights and pirate ghosts in the moonlight.
The picture was directed by Gore Verbinski (""The Ring""), but the more significant credit is that of the producer, Jerry Bruckheimer. One of the very few producer-auteurs, Bruckheimer makes grand, spectacular movies (""Con Air,"" ""The Rock"") that, at their best, have a certain gut-level appeal. That appeal, which invariably has to do with the story, is the elusive part, and that's what is missing from ""Pirates of the Caribbean.""
Depp plays Jack, an 18th century pirate captain who washes up on an island port owned by the British, having lost his ship. Weather-beaten, with long hair, a mouthful of gold teeth and a braided beard, he looks like a dangerous freak, his glazed eyes deadened by all manner of depravity. Then he starts talking, rolling his head in an odd way, and mumbling half to himself, and we realize that he sounds familiar. It takes about 15 minutes to figure it out, but to save you the time: Depp is imitating Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones.
The story of ""Pirates"" involves a group of people, each of whom is trying to recover something. Jack wants to get his ship, the Black Pearl, back from Barbossa (Rush), the fellow pirate who commandeered it. Young Will Turner (Bloom), an earnest blacksmith, wants to rescue his sweetheart, the royal governor's daughter, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), who was kidnapped by Barbossa. Barbossa himself is hoping to use Elizabeth to recover his humanity. He needs her in order to break a curse. And, of course, Elizabeth wants to recover her freedom.
The essential problem of ""Pirates"" is that none of these quests has any visceral interest or impact, with the exception, possibly, of Elizabeth's quest for freedom. But in her case there's nothing she can do -- she's stuck on the ship. The movie instead concentrates on the effort of Capt. Jack to regain the Black Pearl, but why should an audience care if a pirate, who spends his life pillaging, has himself been robbed? Moreover, though everyone in the movie is intent on making sure that Barbossa is never able to break the Black Pearl curse that he and his crew are suffering under, it's hard to see what would be the harm in that.
As a result ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is an adventure without rooting interest and only spectacle to sustain it. Flash and dazzle do buy it some time. There is the handsome time-travel aspect of seeing red-coated British soldiers and the eeriness of watching cursed pirates turning into skeletons at the first sign of the moon. There is also something to be said for the sheer brazenness of the movie's embrace of the pirate film genre -- the faux rotting teeth on every bit player and the cartoonish pirate accents.
But eventually this medicine stops working, despite increased dosages. Elizabeth goes to stab Barbossa and the movie slams into something that looks like a musical number. The soundtrack cranks up and we're treated to minutes of heavily choreographed nonsense, with a group of pirates tossing up Elizabeth and catching her. That's the first sign of desperation in ""Pirates,"" and others keep coming. Eventually, the movie is reduced to scene after scene of living humans fighting skeleton pirates, but because skeleton pirates can't be killed, there's not much point in watching.
At least Depp and Rush are fun to watch, and so is Bloom, within the limits of the nice-guy role consigned to him. As Elizabeth, Knightley holds her own in this company so much that it comes as a real surprise that she's only 18. This has to be one of the most poised and adult-seeming 18-year-old actresses since Kirsten Dunst -- or Loretta Young."
88,LHM_Doc8_PiratesOfTheCaribbeanTheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,LHM,Action,Negative,Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"In a rational world, a big-budget film inspired by an amusement park thrill ride wouldn’t have a great deal of trouble living up to its origins. But this is today’s Hollywood we’re talking about, and everything is not what it seems.
The Disneyland ride Pirates of the Caribbean is a considerable treat, a brisk and thrilling entertainment experience memorable years after the fact. As director Gore Verbinski takes pains to accurately point out, it is “ingrained in our collective psyche.”
Verbinski’s movie, “Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,” loosely based on that ride, is not fated to be similarly enshrined. This noisy retread, a secondhand facsimile of a movie, is, except for the headache its boisterous sound level leaves you with, as forgettable as a bad day in the Disneyland parking lot.
The noise comes courtesy of producer Jerry Bruckheimer, who is apparently mandated by secret covenant to supply each of his films, even ones set in the 18th century, with the kinds of massive explosions more reminiscent of the siege of Stalingrad than a pirate ship attack.
While writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio are best known for the impressive work they did in “Shrek” and “Aladdin,” they were the opposite of inspired here, alternating tired humor with a veritable checklist of lumpy pirate cliches like talking parrots and references to Davey Jones’ locker. I know it’s all supposed to be tongue-in-cheek, but why isn’t anyone laughing?
Presiding over this cacophonous hubbub is filmmaker Verbinski, whose work on “Mouse Hunt” and “The Ring” have made him one of Hollywood’s favorite utility players, capable of middling work, neither embarrassing nor memorable, in any number of genres. While he’s far too slick to do anything objectionable, he also has trouble creating actual reasons to see films.
In fact, the only inducement “Pirates” provides for anyone to watch at all is Johnny Depp’s eccentric and quirkily amusing performance as temporarily unemployed pirate captain Jack Sparrow.
With piercing black eyes surrounded by kohl, beads in his hair, a beard with tiny braids and enough gold and platinum in his mouth to earn Dr. Rick Glassman, DDS, a credit for “Dental Special Effects for Johnny Depp,” the actor looks less the nautical outlaw than a thrift store refugee about to go clubbing in Hollywood. (Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones was Depp’s acknowledged inspiration.) But though his arch countercultural affect makes him come off as the least piratical of pirates, the captain is plenty good enough to get the job done.
Capt. Sparrow turns up in Port Royal, we gradually learn, looking for a way to catch up with his old ship, the Black Pearl, a vessel that has been taken from him by a mutinous crew led by the infamous Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), “a man so evil that hell itself spat him back.”
This gang, it turns out, have had a curse placed on them that turns them into the living dead, rascals whose bodies conveniently turn into computer-generated Industrial Light & Magic skeletons whenever they venture into the moonlight.
Oblivious to all of this are three of Port Royal’s handsomest young people, involved in a drama of their own. Comely Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the governor’s daughter, is the romantic target of the boring but powerful Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport), while she herself has an eye for the terribly shy sword-maker Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), a lad she has known since childhood.
Circumstances conspire to place Elizabeth in the power of Barbossa and his men, where she wears the kind of bodice-ripper negligees that would have horrified the sporty character the actress played in “Bend It Like Beckham.” Similarly Bloom, fearless in “The Lord of the Rings,” gets to play someone who is convincing both as a timid soul and a hero.
Though these leads are appealing, they are defeated by this thudding bulldozer of a film that spends far too much time on its huge supporting cast of pirates (nowhere near as entertaining as everyone assumes) and on bloated adventure set pieces that redound to no one’s credit. Released just too late for the Fourth of July, this is, fittingly, a would-be firecracker that just doesn’t go off."
89,LHM_Doc9_PiratesOfTheCaribbeanTheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,LHM,Action,Negative,Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"A bloated swashbuckler comedy inspired by a Disney amusement park ride and produced by the ‘king of crap’ Jerry Bruckheimer and, to add to its questionable karma, it is released by the family value people of Disney. It’s a theme park amusement ride big budget summer blockbuster geared mainly for kids. But it ignores their needs by being too long to keep their full attention. It’s directed by Gore Verbinski (“The Ring“) who has achieved status as a safe Hollywood type of director, but who has never made a film that caught my interest. He seems to take some wild rides to nowhere, yet his films never seem like they’re going anyplace or do they leave you much to think about. This one left me yearning to see an old-fashioned Errol Flynn pirate film, instead. If you’re going to do camp, you should learn how to make it nice and freaky like an Andy Warhol could do instinctively. Verbinski’s camp was a bore.
The roguish 18th-century pirate Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who looks more like a party-goer from the modern day Village’s Christopher Street, is made up with beads in his hair, eye-shadow, a beard spotted with tiny braids and enough gold in his teeth to stake a mining claim. Depp is the only film character whose performance I enjoyed and who drew my honest laughter. His quirky shtick and amusing way he inflected his words and made those nervous gestures of waving his hands at imagined dangers and his preening strut, kept me tuned into his comedy act. He also ended up as the only characterization that made sense, even though he was cast in the film’s most bizarre role. The other characterizations were either over the top cheesy like Geoffrey Rush’s or played within the confines of their role in a dull manner like the hero Orlando Bloom or played mostly for their physical agility like heroine Keira Knightley. None of the cast, aside from Depp, ever conveyed a sense that they were real people or that they helped the tongue-in-cheek aims of the story to work better.
Sparrow drops anchor in Port Royal after his island escape and plans to commandeer a British vessel to go after his nemesis Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). He also wants to gather a crew to help reclaim his ship — the Black Pearl. It seems the ruthless Barbossa stole the captaincy by leading a mutiny on Sparrow, and marooned the swishy pirate on a remote and barren island. But first Sparrow must rescue a drowning Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), who fell in the sea because her corset was too tight. Her prim father, Governor Swann (Pryce), gave her this new dress from London to wear for the uptight Commodore Norrington, who is aiming to propose to the unreceptive young beauty. But she’s in love with the upright blacksmith named Will Turner (Bloom), whom she romanticizes as a pirate. While sailing 8 years ago with her father on Norrington’s ship, they rescued the stranded youngster from the sea. While Will was unconscious on deck, the same aged Elizabeth stole the gold medallion he wore around his neck. She stole it because she was afraid the Brits would hang him as a pirate, as the regal young lady has fallen in love at first sight with a guy from the opposite side of the tracks and now suffers from unrequited love.
The wily Captain Barbossa has come to Port Royal to reclaim that medallion because he and his crew have been cursed for their evil deed of stealing the Aztec gold and betraying their pirate captain. They are now ghosts and need to retrieve the medallion and spill the blood of the pirate Will Turner over the treasure chest of Aztec gold in order to undo the curse. It turns out that the timid Will really does have pirate’s blood in him, as it was his pirate father who cursed the mutineers before they killed him.
Barbossa attacks the town of Port Royal and kidnaps the medallion wearing Elizabeth, when she tells him her name is Turner. The long middle-part of the film is smothered with a repetitive plot that makes things far too convoluted with multiple climaxes, as there are a number of plot points that dull down the action scenes and the comedy gets as woozy as Depp’s character. A myriad cast of pirates try to crack one-liners or enact tired skits to show their zaniness, though watching them turn to skeletons (courtesy of CGI-enhanced special effects) whenever the moon was out and wine pour through their skeleton bones was a good way to kill time before the expected sword play took place. It all leads to a typical Hollywood pirate showdown with Barbossa. To Elizabeth’s rescue comes the duty-bound Norrington and her doting father on one ship and in another the Sparrow and Will team are speeding toward Barbossa in a stolen Brit vessel. Will helped Sparrow escape from the brig only because he’s interested in rescuing his love and the pirate knows where she’s been taken. Will turns from timid to heroic when he realizes that he has pirate blood. The dishonest Sparrow stays in character by having ulterior motives in this rescue mission.
Many a pirate cliché from movie lore is attempted and any lame gag that the screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (“Aladdin” and “Shrek”) could possibly think of is loudly thrown into the mix that features: a talking parrot, a mute whose tongue was cut out, a peg leg pirate, a fake eye popping out of a socket, a monkey on the shoulder of a pirate, and a constant clanging sound of jewelry coming from the overdressed pirates. By curbing the violence in the action and going mostly for the goofiness, the film sails in its own murky waters. The only thing that kept it afloat was Depp’s gigantic screen presence. Without him, “Pirates” would have walked the plank without anyone caring. Depp’s odd performance should probably make this film live on as a cult classic and become recognized as a bad film that has a certain entertainment value that counters its tedium."
90,LHM_Doc10_PiratesOfTheCaribbeanTheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,LHM,Action,Negative,Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"If you think the title is long, wait until you see the movie.  At two hours, 23 minutes running time, a good guy captured by pirates should pray for a plank to walk that’s this long.  Gone with the Wind, which covered the Civil War and its aftermath, was only 55 minutes longer. Although you might find it hard to believe as you’re sitting through it, it does end eventually, and the proof is that I am actually sitting here writing this review.
Johnny Depp plays a constantly inebriated pirate captain (Jack Sparrow) in this tongue-in-cheek sendup of pirate movies.  Did we really need a sendup of pirate movies?  When’s the last time you saw one?  Who was in it?  Burt Lancaster?  Gene Kelly?  Errol Flynn?  What, Hollywood has nothing better to do than spoof a genre that’s been dead for fifty years?
And, please, if you’re going to do a spoof, make it intelligent.  People it with good actors.  Give it a good script.  Give it a story, for heaven’s sake.  Alas, Disney/Jerry Bruckheimer did none of these.  Oh, there are a couple of guys, Geoffrey Rush, who plays the dastardly Captain Barbossa, and another guy, who do pale imitations of Robert Newton as Long John Silver in Treasure Island, circa 1950, the quintessential cinematic pirate.  But, like this movie, they fall way, way short of Newton’s genius. 
In the unlikely event that you still want to see this, I won’t ruin it for you by telling the story (that’s a joke, son).  There’s Hitchcock’s mainstay, the McGuffin that the pirates need, and it’s all pretty silly, but that’s OK because this is a farce (and I don’t use that as a term of opprobrium; it’s meant to be a farce). But I will warn you that, except for Depp and Rush, the acting’s mediocre at best.  Keira Knightly, who did a workmanlike job in Bend it Like Beckham is mightily miscast here as the gorgeous damsel in distress, Elizabeth Swann.  She’s not gorgeous enough (she’s not gorgeous, period).  And the lines she’s given would put any actress to the test.  Depp’s besotted Captain Sparrow starts out humorous, but finally becomes tiresome.  I’m also offended by vacuous filmmakers who think it’s funny to show the harmless drunk.  Alcoholism is no joke, folks, and movies like this (and the worst of the loveable drunk genre, Arthur) trivialize a serious problem.  Hollywood, however, loves drugs; you’re not gonna breathe much if you hold your breath until Hollywood takes a stand against drug use.  Even though we don’t see him taking a drink until near the longed-for end, Sparrow’s constantly drunk, even when he’s locked away in jail.
This has a lot of mindless violence.  But that’s what you would expect in a pirate movie, unless it’s The Pirates of Penzance. Here people keep fighting dead people who can’t be killed.  They knew they were dead going in.  What’s the point?  And the fights take up about the last seven hours (OK, it just seemed like seven hours) of the movie.  One fight after another between a man and a skeleton.  Then there’s a fight between two skeletons.  There apparently aren’t any Basil Rathbones left in Hollywood because all the sword fighting is shot with Chicago-like quick cuts so you can’t see if any of these hunks can actually handle a sword.
This is apparently a big hit if you judge by numbers.  The only way I can explain this is to postulate that watching this after sitting through Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle, Legally Blonde 2, and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is akin to the relief you feel when someone stops hitting you over the head with a hammer and starts pinching you.  It’s good only in comparison with what came before."
91,IFV_Doc1_TheGrandBudapestHotel,IFV,Comedy,Negative,The Grand Budapest Hotel,"I'd be hard-pressed to think of many sequences in the movies better than the two minutes from Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums where Richie gets picked up at the Green Line Bus by his adopted sister Margot following a lengthy absence. It's beautifully composed, emotionally weighted, and punctuated with the best use of Nico in a sentence, ever. There's a rub there--my favourite Wes Anderson films are the ones that use music in this way; I ally him in my mind with artists like Sofia Coppola and, sure, Quentin Tarantino. I think the full potential of film is only really reached when all the elements that go into a movie--the seven arts, as it were--are used in concert. Wes Anderson, as he utilizes fewer and fewer pop songs in his films (his latest, The Grand Budapest Hotel, is his first without any), is losing emotional complexity as his hermetically-sealed, obsessive-compulsive dreamscapes become increasingly complex. Consider the moment from Django Unchained where our heroes ride into act two to Jim Croce's ""I Got a Name."" It's iconic, transformative; the scene has a quarter of its power without the agency of that song. Tarantino truly gets it. When Anderson opens The Darjeeling Limited with The Kinks' ""This Time Tomorrow,"" letting the scene play in slow-motion as Adrien Brody's character tries to outrun the ghost of his father, wow. I remember hearing about the introductory tracking shot of the research vessel in The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, how Anderson was possibly planning on scoring it with a Radiohead song (""How to Disappear Completely,"" if memory serves) and how that potential marriage gave me a shiver of anticipation. The farther Anderson falls into his navel, the clearer it is that he no longer gets what he used to get, swallowed whole by the grey beast solipsism. For The Grand Budapest Hotel, Anderson creates a doll's house once again: a country entire (after the last one's island) and a war to destabilize it. He harks back to end-of-the-empire fare like The Lady Vanishes, aping that picture's climax and then commenting a time or two on the idea that basic decency, today rare in the human species, was nearing its extinction generations ago, doomed by tradition and manners. It's the manners that Anderson's trying to excuse in his own work now, as if he knows it's all getting out of hand but, hey, isn't it better down here in the basement with the tin men I've painted to re-enact the little Bull Runs on this table? Just like that scale model of a Civil War battle, the outcome of The Grand Budapest Hotel is never in doubt--no matter the meticulousness of its simulacra--nor, as a consequence, do the tribulations of his tin soldiers have much emotional heft and attachment. Which is not to say that Anderson doesn't try to inject father issues into the tale of concierge par excellence M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) and his tutelage of ""Lobby Boy"" orphan Zero (Tony Revolori), which leads from one flashback to another and back to a mid-current where Zero, grown into F. Murray Abraham, relates his sweeping tale of ruin to a half-interested author (Jude Law) who grows into Tom Wilkinson writing a book--who grows into a statue of the author played by Wilkinson, to which a young woman pays her respects whilst reading, yes, The Grand Budapest Hotel. It's tempting to call this structure a series of nesting dolls, given the Eastern European suggestions of the settings and title, but doing so is as adorably twee and empty as The Grand Budapest Hotel itself.
In essence, the film is about Zero, who's at the mercy of detailed list-maker and taskmaster M. Gustave, losing his innocence when an aged spinster (Tilda Swinton, terribly wasted) dies, leaving her nasty son (Adrien Brody) and her nasty son's nasty henchman, Jopling (Willem Dafoe), in a rage once it's discovered that M. Gustave offered carnal comfort to dear mother in her last days. Fiennes finds humanity in Anderson's character sketch, as does newcomer Revolori. The rest is all just carefully-posed eccentricity, the very manifestation of hipsterism and all the weariness that implies. It's affectation without authenticity, unseemly Francophlia with only real love for the opportunities for affectation such an affliction provides. I'm fascinated by the division between the audience that adores the Wes Anderson before The Fantastic Mr. Fox (where he first tasted the fruit of absolute, monolithic control over a production) and the audience that adores him after. I find there's little crossover. There's not a ten-minute stretch in The Royal Tenenbaums I can watch without weeping--it's the truest emotional conduit I have to my grief for my father's death and the ruin of our relationship before it. Yet there's not one moment The Grand Budapest Hotel (or Moonrise Kingdom before it) that moves me even in a basic way: not when Anderson dedicates his film to suicidal Austrian playwright Stefan Zweig, not even when he mocks up an Egon Schiele line-drawing to introduce an idea of subversion into his hermetic universe. Two moments from the film define Anderson for me now: the first is when M. Gustave is called a ""faggot"" and ripostes upon a subsequent taunt that there's a logical gap between assignation of that term and his having fucked someone's mother. (An observation answered with, ""Well, you're bisexual."") It's not funny, because it's trying hard to be cute and then also pithy and then also political and self-aware, and it's impossible for so many things to simultaneously occupy the same space. The other moment is the reveal of Harvey Keitel, shirtless, in one of the endless parade of cameos--and how poor Harvey can't seem to stop himself from twitching and flexing self-consciously in denial of his age, perhaps, or at least his obvious discomfort with it. Here's one of our most physical, most intimate of actors asked to be a prop, and the strain shows. The Grand Budapest Hotel is a clockwork contraption built with obsessive detail and care that has no function. Without L. Frank Baum's built-in irony and affirmation, it's Dorothy's Tin Man (as well as her Straw Man, when it pontificates about the fallen man), and its effect is something like one of those Cirque du Soleil travelling tent shows. It's a wonder, a marvel, a sensual delight; and when it's over, you don't feel it's worth spending the ten bucks for the memento of a program. The cure for its emptiness is Anderson's own early work, of course, but I'm reminded of something a frail Pauline Kael told a young Anderson about his Rushmore: ""I don't know what you have here."" Six films later, I think the three of us (Kael, me, Anderson) are in total alignment at last."
92,IFV_Doc2_TheGrandBudapestHotel,IFV,Comedy,Negative,The Grand Budapest Hotel,"Death has always been central to Wes AndersonÕs films. That might seem a strange thing to say when you consider the elaborately pretty candy-box aesthetic he favors, but itÕs true. Just think of the gory fore arm-slitting suicide attempt Ñ using the classic and correct vertical-slit form of suicide by exsanguination Ñ in the middle of The Royal Tenenbaums. Think of how often Anderson uses a characterÕs demise to motivate or cap his series of amusing scenes, without ever disturbing the overall impression of amusement (The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, The Darjeeling Limited, Tenenbaums). Consider that Anderson kills a beloved animal for laughs in almost every film. Usually itÕs a dog, but in The Grand Budapest Hotel he switches it up and kills a cat. The corpse is carried away by his loving owner inside an impromptu bag made out of fine-looking cloth marred by a single, artful blotch of blood. Then the owner, played by Jeff Goldblum with his usual self-amused irony, passes a garbage can on the street and abruptly tosses the bag into it with a slapstick comedy thump.It was at that moment that I became officially sick of Wes Anderson, and of the gleeful laughter in the theater that accompanies every Wes Anderson-ish move he makes. The audience even anticipates the move heÕs going to make and begins guffawing ahead of time, just to be sure to appear maximally Wes-savvy. Many more characters die in Grand Budapest Hotel than in most Anderson films, but as usual they create no ripple on the movieÕs polished surface. Main character MoutavaÕs beloved wife succumbs off-screen to Òthe Polish grippe,Ó and itÕs fun to hear ÒPolish grippeÓ pronounced aloud. There are several entertaining murders done by Willem DafoeÕs cartoonishly ruthless proto-SS assassin, the goriest of which involves four severed fingers, which are shown lying in the snow in extreme close-up and then fastidiously picked up by the assassin one by one. The death that hurt me personally, other than the catÕs, was that of the poor, downtrodden, terrified, clubfooted laundress, because she was clearly DOA from the moment she appeared onscreen. Her head is produced from a cloth bag, a different cloth bag Ñ cloth murder bags and pink boxes of pastries are recurring motifs, you might say Ñ with the face stuck in the position of her final scream. After viewing The Grand Budapest Hotel, I realized I had had it with AndersonÕs fancy boxed chocolates. Either theyÕve gotten toxically moldy over time, or they were always disgusting and I was too disgusting myself to notice it. To put it bluntly, IÕve decided I hate Wes Anderson, and that at some level, IÕd like to think IÕve always hated him. I wish I could come up with a quick, clever way to sum up my hatred and be done with it, like Kyle Smith of the New York Post, who ends his furious pan of The Grand Budapest Hotelwith the snappy line, ÒThatÕs Wes Anderson: He canÕt see the forest for the twee.Ó But I feel so ill from watching Grand Budapest myself, I have to plod my way through the Anderson experience in order to understand it. IÕve kept watching his films these many years because I have a terrible weakness for film formalism. In a world full of dull, vaguely realist films of no particular visual interest, I am mad for striking compositions, thematically significant camera movements, and gorgeous color schemes. So it would seem as if Wes Anderson would be the perfect auteur for me. But he never has been, really. IÕve generally felt more disturbed than pleased to find myself responding to some aspect of an Anderson film. For example, I was pole-axed by a beautiful choral arrangement of the old folk song ÒOld Abram BrownÓ in Moonrise Kingdom because it seemed to suggest so intimate a knowledge of my own childhood. We used to sing that song as a round back in elementary school, and IÕve quizzed some of my peers to see if they remember doing the same. So far, no one does, and the result is that I feel vaguely creeped out, as if Wes Anderson and I went to the same elementary school and, out of all the captive children, we alone responded to that strange old song and were hooked like fish on hearing it again. It goes like this: Old Abram Brown is dead and gone, weÕll never see him more, He used to wear a long grey coat that buttoned down before. There were more verses about other dead men weÕd never see more, but I canÕt remember them. It was a hell of a rhyme to sing at the age of eight or whatever I was, but I liked the song. I liked all those weird old songs we used to sing that strongly evoked a world preceding ours, a world that was deep, dark, and hard in ways I couldnÕt fathom. Our own suburban grade-school world was extremely mean and full of anxiety, but thatÕs a different thing. So I canÕt claim Anderson doesnÕt have a certain power as a filmmaker. But after watching The Grand Budapest Hotel, it seems clear he doesnÕt use his power for good. He gloats over small contemporary cruelties, he candy-coats a world of casual nastiness in bright colors and hummable tunes, and death in his films makes no mark, it just functions as a design element, a dash of dark pigment that sets off the bright colors to better advantage. And now on top of everything, instead of his usual indirect evocation of that older, deeper, darker, harder, unfathomable past in remembered songs and storybook allusions, as part of the nostalgia kit Anderson characters seem to carry about like fashionable messenger bags, he announces with this new film that heÕll present that lost world to us outright. He doesnÕt do it, of course. But even his semblance of doing it is horrible, like a waking nightmare.
In The Grand Budapest Hotel, we get 1930s Eastern Europe as a baroque Neverland still embedded in a comically aristocratic nineteenth-century past, but on the cusp of a fascist takeover. ItÕs the cutest fascist takeover ever conceived. The Nazi-equivalents march around sporting a ÒZZÓ logo instead of a swastika, and their leader, played by Ed Norton as a nice understanding fellow just trying to do his job, sports on his stiff old-fashioned hard-billed cap the sweetly cartoon-drawn head of a wolf. Anderson has had the sense to give himself plausible deniability regarding this grotesque vision of the past by making it tricky, embedding it in a series of narrated flashbacks. The film starts with a beloved author, played by Tom Wilkinson, whoÕs revered in the mythical Eastern European country of Zebrowka, telling the story of his younger self in the 1970s, played by Jude Law, who gets told the life story of the mysterious wealthy owner of the Grand Budapest Hotel by the man himself, Zero Moustava, played by F. Murray Abraham. So we flash back again, to the early 1930s, and watch young Zero Moustava, played by Tony Revolori (who could no more become anything like F. Murray Abraham in old age than Jude Law could ever resemble Tom Wilkinson), enact the tale of his adventurous life as a lobby boy and protg of the flamboyant hotel concierge Monsieur Gustave, played by Ralph Fiennes. Even my excessive love of formal effects was tested by these maddeningly detailed flashbacks one within the other like nesting-boxes, each one distinguished by different color schemes and aspect ratios, but not at all distinguished in sensibility. WhatÕs the point in flashing back to older times in supposedly different cultures if everyone poses for the camera in exactly the same distrait Andersonian manner, dresses in the same type of outr form-fitting outfits, and are played by callow modern types like Anderson favorites Owen Wilson and Jason Schwarzman? The focus of the film is on M. Gustave, the charismatic concierge who supposedly represents the grandly sophisticated Old Europe that is celebrated in the film and finally lost to the forces of fascism and modernity. AndersonÕs film evokes several classic ones by talented writer/directors trained in the pre-Fascist German film industry who managed to get out in time, such as Ernst Lubitsch (Trouble in Paradise, To Be Or Not to Be), Max Ophuls (Letter From an Unknown Woman, Earrings of Madame D. . .) and Emeric Pressburger (working with British partner Michael Powell on The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp). All created characters featuring a remarkable zest for life in the form of fine food, broad-minded sex, and witty conversation combined with excellent manners and admirable toughness. Lubitsch and Pressburger engaged directly in anti-fascist film propaganda by presenting fond portraits of such endangered Good Europeans. M. Gustave is clearly meant to join this pantheon, announcing himself as the last vestige of civilization in Òthis barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity.Ó Only hereÕs the problem: Wes AndersonÕs Old Europe is just like a modern Andersonian world we know so well, mannered, decorative and nostalgic, with slight additional flourishes in the form of fancier pastries and adorable funiculars for traveling up and down cartoon-cute mountains. Newly fascist Europe on the rise looks to be wonderfully Wes-like, only with slightly severer uniforms. 1970s Communist Zebrowka is the same too, though the dcor takes on violent orange colors, but since Anderson loves 70s retro, that blends in fine. Which brings us to the present day in made-up Zebrowka, which is obviously Wes-world again.  Since itÕs all seamlessly unified, the whole suggestion that something wonderful has been lost circa 1934 carries no weight. Though perhaps the confusion comes in with the expectation that anything Anderson does would carry weight. Enthralled film critics have been insisting that Anderson has created in Grand Budapest Hotel a fully mature work of art defined by a sense of melancholy over a lost world. IÕd suggest they are confused by the characters in the film that sit around looking melancholy over a supposedly lost world, which is a different thing. Anderson has reached the dizzying point of fantasizing about feeling nostalgic for nostalgia itself, for the purer strain of heartsick longing that was presumably felt once upon a time. Really, Fredric Jameson ought to see this film in light of his famous discussion of the nostalgia film as an instance of postmodern pastiche, with its Òcomplacent play of historical allusion.Ó Would he have a stroke on the spot watching this latest, pastichiest iteration, a textbook case right out of the pages of JamesonÕs own ÒPostmodernism and Consumer SocietyÓ? Would he laugh diabolically? Would he feel the only true melancholy in a theater where The Great Budapest Hotel is playing? For here is the most ludicrously extreme representation of postmodern cinemaÕs Òundefinable nostalgic past. . .beyond history.Ó Here is represented the complete Òhistorical amnesiaÓ Jameson warned us would preclude our ability to grapple politically with our own moment in time. IÕve been confessing my egregious mistake in letting myself be taken in so long by Wes AndersonÕs formalist blandishments. Let me now add a profounder mea culpa for my old grad school self, who considered Fredric Jameson a tedious old Marxist trying to harsh my movie-going mellow. Forgive me, Fred! You were right all along!"
93,IFV_Doc3_TheGrandBudapestHotel,IFV,Comedy,Negative,The Grand Budapest Hotel,"IÕm beginning to think I have the cultural depth of a rock when it comes to film. Or maybe, I just have an inability to laugh. It could be my broken funny bone Ñ true story. When ÒThe Grand Budapest HotelÓ came out earlier this year, the trailer looked interesting. Quirky, perhaps. IÕll admit there was a small part of me that was intrigued. But it wasnÕt a film I was going to pay theater prices to see. I should have trusted my earlier instincts. Director/producer/writer Wes Anderson has apparently become someone I will never trust. Ever. My previous knowledge of the man came from 2009Õs ÒThe Fantastic Mr. Fox.Ó While a friend of mine loved the film, I found it had no redeeming qualities apart from a very grumpy fox named Ash. His ear twitched often in irritation, and I hoped the character would find a way to end the movie by any means necessary. It was one of the few times I would approve of fox homicide. Weekend Editor Steve Wildsmith spoke highly of 2012Õs ÒMoonrise Kingdom,Ó in which Anderson also served as director, writer and producer. I personally thought it looked atrociously boring and refused to see it. Considering the hate-hate relationship I have with Anderson, it doesnÕt make much sense that I picked up ÒGrand BudapestÓ at Redbox. Well, sometimes IÕm not overly bright. The film booked an amazing cast Ñ notice the hotel joke. Its star power was one of the things that made it appeal to me in the first place. With a cast of Ralph Fiennes, Jeff Goldblum, Edward Norton, Jude Law, Tilda Swinton, Tom Wilkinson, Adrien Brody, Harvey Keitel, Bill Murray, F. Murray Abraham and Willem Dafoe, how could it be bad? Apparently IÕd blocked out the fact that ÒFantastic Mr. FoxÓ had my beloved Meryl Streep. She didnÕt save that one, and this crew couldnÕt save ÒGrand Budapest.Ó Fiennes stars as M. Gustave, the hotel concierge of the Grand Budapest. Along with his lobby boy, Zero (Tony Revolori), they embark on an adventure of epic proportions after one of GustaveÕs elderly lovers (Swinton) is killed, and heÕs blamed. He steals an expensive painting she bequeaths him, he goes to prison, he escapes and it just goes on from there. Much of the humor is deadpanned. GoldblumÕs character, for example, asking calmly if his cat was just thrown out a window after a large yowl is heard. FYI, it was. Or this exchange: Gustave: ÒShe was dynamite in the sack, by the way.Ó Zero: ÒShe was 84 ...ÓGustave: ÒIÕve had older.Ó Each line is delivered with a subtlety that doesnÕt fit the overall absurdity. Ideally, performances support the script. The two shouldnÕt be at odds Ñ unless the creatorÕs purpose is to cast a light on the difference between art and plot. Despite this creative tension, I could still appreciate the performance of each and every actor. Fiennes and Revolori steal the film with a credible rapport. The film is also original, and IÕm sure to some itÕs clever, maybe even brilliant. For me, itÕs over the top and borders on the extremely absurd. While the film is a visual feast for the eyes, there were some sights I just couldnÕt get past. They pulled me out of its reality, forcing me to address and attempt to reconcile them. First of all, much of the film is told in flashbacks, actually two sets of flashbacks. ItÕs a story within a story. Abraham serves as one of our storytellers. HeÕs the older Zero while Revolori plays the teenage version. IÕm not exactly sure how Anderson and Co. decided it made sense to have a young actor of Guatemalan descent portray an early incarnation of a character who would later be played by a white man. Perhaps Zero fell victim to the same disease that plagued the late Michael Jackson. Or perhaps itÕs just one more touch that adds to the world Anderson has created, one that doesnÕt Ñ possibly isnÕt Ñ supposed to fit a neat mold. I donÕt know, and Anderson never provides me with enough evidence to arrive at an answer whether these inconsistencies serve a larger purpose. Some might call that brave. I donÕt, though. I call it lazy. Artists, and other professional communicators, are here to communicate emotions and thoughts with an audience using all the tools at their disposal. All in all, IÕm in the critical minority when it comes to ÒGrand Budapest.Ó I didnÕt find it amusing, and while I can appreciate the creativity, itÕs an hour and 40 minutes I wish I could take back."
94,IFV_Doc4_TheGrandBudapestHotel,IFV,Comedy,Negative,The Grand Budapest Hotel,"Already, in Rushmore, you could sense that Wes Anderson felt a nostalgia for world-historical sufferings he hadnÕt endured. ItÕs not an uncommon imaginative kink among the more privileged Americans of his age group, the ones who reached adulthood in the safely self-involved years between the demise of the Soviet bloc and the start of the Òwar on terror.Ó In the novels of Jonathan Safran FoerÑthose reconstructions of the twentieth centuryÕs Top 10 enormities, done in a mode of sighing whimsyÑyou may find one example of an artist of this generation measuring his ease and cleverness against the horrors of the past. Another example is Rushmore, where a 1990s prep-school boy idealizes the Vietnam War as a test of manhood that he will never get to pass, and a thrilling adventure (known entirely from movies) that he can re-create onstage. 
In Rushmore, at least, this longing for oneÕs own private Tet offensive was not a generalized condition, but the trait of a single decidedly immature character. Something similar might be said of The Royal Tenenbaums, in which a drug-addled novelist, who has faced no greater challenge in life than going to bed with Gwyneth Paltrow, tries to turn himself into a buckskin-clad facsimile of George Armstrong Custer. By the time Anderson got to Moonrise Kingdom, though, his disappointment at having missed all the good bloodbaths had leaked out of the character and into the movieÕs atmosphere. It did so charmingly, of course, with a becomingly modest if highly detailed sense of play; but when a Boy Scout came onscreen dressed and outfitted like a nineteenth-century frontiersman, it was clear that Anderson was now doing more than delineating an individual. He was evoking a desire thatÕs in the air, a half-embarrassed, half-guilty wish to know something of the great convulsions of the past, if only in the form of miniaturized romance.
In that spirit, the first thing Anderson does in his new movie, The Grand Budapest Hotel, is go back in time, from frame story to frame story, as if to acknowledge how far he stands from his main characters, who live amid the rising fascism of Central Europe in the 1930s. The last thing Anderson does in the movie does is collapse that temporal distance abruptly, as if snapping shut a telescope. YouÕre in a film ruled by incongruities of space and time, in which you jump from the toylike, flat animation that provides the first view of the Grand Budapest Hotel, high in the mountains of the fictitious nation of Zubrowka, to the perspectival vastness of the hotelÕs lobby, which looks as if it could swallow all of Last Year at Marienbad (except that Marienbad was shot in wide-screen, and Budapest mostly uses the squarish format of 1930s films). Anderson cuts from the absurdly coffinlike dimensions of an imperial-red passenger elevator, barely big enough to hold four people if they donÕt breathe, to the equally absurd expanse of a dining room where a party of two is surrounded by an acre of empty tables. He juxtaposes the prisonlike confinement of a hotel employeeÕs room with the vertiginous grandeur of a real prison; he contrasts the doll-size quarters occupied by a pastry-shop assistantÑin the Central Europe of myth, all cream-filled shells are works of artÑwith a castleÕs cavernous hunting-trophy hall, which is as big as all outdoors. Above all, Anderson plays with the incongruities of age, size, personality and acting craft of his two principal figures: the concierge of the Grand Budapest Hotel in its heyday, Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), and the hotelÕs novice lobby boy, Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori). Middle-aged and teenaged, tall and short, worldly and nave, overbearing and eager to please, Gustave and Zero are the latest in AndersonÕs line of morally questionable older men and the intelligent lads they instruct.
The mentor in the current pair is distinguished by his round-the-clock evening wear, sleek silhouette, gigoloÕs manners, and habit of either making grand pronouncements on trivial subjects or dismissing grave matters as trivialities. (There again you have the contrast in scale.) ItÕs difficult to think of an actor other than Fiennes who could have made Gustave so drawling and yet quick-tongued, so self-dramatizing and yet (despite himself) endearing, so that you wonder if this nobody from nowhere had taught himself to pass as a gent by studying recordings of Nol Coward. Now Zero studies Gustave. Dressed in a painted-on mustache and a pillbox hat labeled ÒLobby BoyÓ in enormous letters, Tony Revolori looks like someone whose whole life is two sizes too big for him, and copes with the problem by maintaining the earnest deadpan that is standard among the protgs in AndersonÕs films. Against FiennesÕs virtuosic flourishes, Revolori is allowed to deploy little more than an occasional sidelong glance, as if heÕd been told he could watch his great co-starÕs performance only out of the corner of his eye. HeÕs a faultless straight man.
But what do these two actually do in The Grand Budapest Hotel? Thematically, they live through EuropeÕs last days of waltzes, schlag and fluttering old countesses. Literally, they chase through AndersonÕs elaborate sets and the wintry landscape, pursuing a large windfall for Gustave and being pursued by the people who donÕt want him to get it: a protofascist aristocrat (Adrien Brody) and his motorcycle-driving thug (Willem Dafoe). This plot is wholly inadequate to the subject, and Anderson knows it. In fact, he planned it that way.You might say The Grand Budapest Hotel is one big example of the device that rhetoricians call the inexpressibility trope. The Greeks knew this figure of speech through Homer: ÒI could not relate the multitude [of the Achaeans] nor name them, not if I had ten tongues and ten mouths.Ó The Jews know it, too, through an ancient part of their liturgy: ÒWere our mouths as full of song as the sea, and the joy of our tongues as countless as the wavesÉwe still could not give thanks enough.Ó And, needless to say, Shakespeare knew it, or at least Bottom did: ÒThe eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, manÕs hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive nor his heart to report what my dream was.Ó
AndersonÕs goofy dream is of course closest to BottomÕs version of inexpressibility. With great panache and an almost imperceptible wink, he serves up witty confections of sets, costumes and acting that are as deliberately mismatched to the terrors of this history as is Zero to Gustave. This is the filmÕs ultimate incongruity, meant to amuse and touch you while keeping Anderson honest about his firsthand ignorance of fascism, war and a half-century of Soviet dreadfulness. But by the time he decides to kill a few minutes by sending Gustave and Zero barreling down a winter-sports competition courseÑthe closest thing that Universal Studios will ever find to thrill-ride potential in a Wes Anderson filmÑthe fun has begun to wear thin. By the time he has Zero recall, in voiceover, that one of the people close to him died of Òthe Prussian grippe,Ó the fun, too, has died, along with any hope that Anderson has a grip on his material. He has attributed the inspiration for The Grand Budapest Hotel to a bout of reading Stefan Zweig. Other points of reference that he cites are Hannah ArendtÕs Eichmann in Jerusalem and Irne NmirovskyÕs Suite Franaise. To the best of my knowledge, he has not mentioned another work that might have been a useful model, Jiri MenzelÕs I Served the King of England. If youÕve seen that movie, you will know that itÕs possible to tell about the grand sweep of events in Central Europe from the point of view of someone small, hapless and servile; that lightness of touch, and broken-hearted laughter, can be perfectly appropriate to this subject; and that when a fancy, self-important matre dÕhtel chooses to defy the Nazis to their faces, it really can seem like a brave assertion of civilized values. It just doesnÕt seem like that when Monsieur Gustave does it, despite Wes AndersonÕs best hopes.
In making I Served the King of England, Menzel had this advantage over Anderson: he lived through some of the history he showed. The author of his source novel, Bohumil Hrabal, had the terrible luck to have lived through all of it. I donÕt say this to belittle Anderson, a wonderful artist to whom I owe some of my best movie experiences of the past years; nor would I disparage the desire to think oneÕs way into the lives of people in other times. Even when that project entails a bit of pilferage, with the moral coin of suffering making its way, unearned, into the wrong pockets, I think itÕs much better to acknowledge past horrors than to ignore themÑespecially these days, when entire polemical industries are devoted to denying that anything bad happened at all. Still, IÕm bothered when an overabundance of surface effects (again, I think of Jonathan Safran Foer) covers up a ringingly hollow purpose, containing very little except authorial will. So I turn for contrast to the new documentary by Rithy Panh, The Missing Picture, which carries with it such a burden of personal and collective pain, and bears reliable witness to such a huge historical crime, that IÕm almost ashamed to add that itÕs inventive, imaginative, beautiful and at times even charming.
Born in Phnom Penh in 1964, and forced at age 13 into a Khmer Rouge slave labor camp where he saw his family die, one by one, Panh has previously made strong but fairly straightforward films about the Pol Pot regime. Perhaps the best known is S21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine [see Klawans, ÒBand of Insiders,Ó June 7, 2004], which foreshadowed Joshua OppenheimerÕs method in The Act of Killing by having the murderers re-enact their deeds on-site. From S21, you could have known that Panh is an elegantly thoughtful filmmaker who respects both the trace of reality in photographic evidence and its mute incompleteness. You would not, however, have been able to predict the flood of imagery (the metaphor is PanhÕs) that hits you in the face in The Missing Picture, nor the pathos with which he substitutes intimate, handmade scenes for realities too large or too awful to represent.
One last incongruity of scale for present purposes, one last confrontation with the inexpressible: in The Missing Picture, Panh re-creates his life in the Khmer Rouge camps through the use of painted dioramas, populated by innumerable carved clay figures small enough to fit in your hand. ItÕs a toy genocide, complete with little boxcars and tumbrils for the victims, barracks, machine guns, loudspeakers, dogs, water buffalo, bicycles, flags and cooking pots (not that thereÕs much to cook). Interspersed with these images of dolls being worked and starved to death are segments of Khmer Rouge propaganda films showing the glorious leap forward of Democratic Kampuchea. Look closely at the footage, as the filmÕs narrator observes in voiceover, and you will see facts that donÕt support the slogansÑwraithlike children staggering under the weight of their labor, for exampleÑbut were inadvertently memorialized all the same. In the filmÕs language, these pictures are not missing. The dioramas, on the other hand, testify to experiences for which the pictures are absent, or rather exist only in Rithy PanhÕs memoriesÑmemories that he would like to get rid of by showing them to you.
But thatÕs only half the story. Panh also has missing pictures that he cherishes: scenes that he re-created because he wishes he could go back and dwell in them. These are his recollections of the family house in Phnom Penh, with schoolwork at the kitchen table, dinners in the courtyard with the aunts and cousins, and rock-and-roll dance parties where his brother played guitar.
I donÕt think itÕs too much to say that PanhÕs loyalty to this lost world of childhood is something he shares with Wes Anderson. Both of them are drawn to the emotions of a vanished boyhood, which they see as idyllic and doomed. Both dramatize adult situations through methods that accord with a childÕs feelings. The difference between The Grand Budapest Hotel and The Missing Picture is that Anderson retrojects his reveries of childhood into a Ruritanian neverland, whereas Panh carries his forward into the Cambodian nightmare he was actually forced to endure.
And if you didnÕt know PanhÕs biography? You would still recognize The Missing Picture, for all its fancifulness, as the real thing. It begins its US theatrical run this month, at New York CityÕs Film Forum and elsewhere."
95,IFV_Doc5_TheGrandBudapestHotel,IFV,Comedy,Negative,The Grand Budapest Hotel,"A transfixing chord of melancholy runs through Wes AndersonÕs latest film, a curt, chipper European caper called The Grand Budapest Hotel. Set in roughly four time periods, but mostly in the 1930s, this rueful comedy wears its Andersonian shabbiness like an old mink stole, hangs it up like a chandelier in a once-grand ballroom. ItÕs wistfulness as decoration, lending AndersonÕs gaudy rooms a whisper of something deeper, a mournful sense of the Old World being really, well, old. I only wish Anderson had made this wintry, bittersweet feeling the centerpiece of his film. Instead, he focuses the bulk of The Grand Budapest Hotel on a kitschy adventure story that feels curiously weightless, at times even arbitrary. The action unfolds in a fictional European country called Zubrowka, eastern enough to tingle with some Carpathian darkness but western enough to abut the Alps, with all the monied, continental grandeur they imply. As the title of the film suggests, Zubrowka has a vaguely Hungarian air to it, especially when itÕs taken over by a bunch of jackboots during the filmÕs frenzied climax. Anderson has, as ever, built a meticulous world: train stations and ski resorts and narrow-streeted cities full of spirited quirks and loving details that play like an homage to something he himself invented. The Grand Budapest HotelÕs European whimsy feels familiar in parts, but I can't quite place all the references. All I know is what it conjured up for me, which was hints of Richard Scarry, definitely some Edward Gorey, and, most oddly, a few elements from the old Ravensburger board game Midnight Party. Whatever his outside influences, Anderson assembles and fuses them together so thoroughly that itÕs as if he were trademarking them with his own imaginative stamp. What weÕre seeing has the homeyness of a familiar place, but still bubbles over with unique surprise. One big surprise in this film is how violent it is. There have been brief moments of light carnage in AndersonÕs earlier films, but here he rather casually shows us severed fingers and bodies riddled with bullets. HeÕs raising the stakes of the adventure, yes, but I suspect heÕs also trying to give his film a little edge. Which it definitely needs, but not necessarily in the places he puts it. The 1930s section of the film deals with the onset of a WWII-ish conflict, and that Ò-ishÓ is a problem. All the cutesiness in the world canÕt really make what was beginning to happen in 1930s Europe remotely charming, as Anderson seems to want to do. Here he could have seized a rare opportunity to deepen his gaze, to take the film beyond his typical bemused remoteness. But instead he gives us a few bloody fingers and then bounces along. ItÕs perhaps a strange comparison to make, but Grand Budapest Hotel left me with the same feeling I had after Django Unchained, both films in which wildly talented auteurs walk up to a serious historical era, only to skitter away from its most harrowing implications. To me, Django Unchainedrepresents what I hope is the nadir of TarantinoÕs exhausting self-regard, and The Grand Budapest Hotel, for all its delightful tics and peculiarities, is finally the film that had me screaming for Wes Anderson to say something. Anything, really. Here we have the crumbling of grand old Europe, dark armies marching across picturesque lands, the first early glints of the Iron Curtain. Anderson could actually interact with all this heavy stuff and still construct his chintzy hotels, still send his manic characters twirling like tops around elegant old rooms. Instead, he made a chase movie. I realize I havenÕt really mentioned the movieÕs plot. I guess thatÕs a testament to its pleasant-enough flimsiness. The film begins with a very brief but lovely scene in the present day, before jumping back a few years to Tom Wilkinson as ZubrowkaÕs beloved national writer, then back further to the writer as a younger man, played by Jude Law, trying to glean from its mysterious owner, Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), the history of the storied old Grand Budapest Hotel, a once-magnificent landmark that has devolved into a 1960s Soviet-esque horror of orange and plastic. And then itÕs all the way back to the 1930s, when Moustafa is a young lobby boy named Zero, played by newcomer Tony Revolori. (Someone should probably write a bunch of words about Zero being the latest example of AndersonÕs unsettling affection for oddball, brown-skinned domestics.) Zero is the protege of the hotelÕs master concierge, Gustave. Winsomely embodied by an ever-game Ralph Fiennes, Gustave is a lothario who sleeps with older (often just plain old) women for what looks to be financial gain, though he isnÕt really a creep or a villain. HeÕs just another addition to AndersonÕs long list of lovable cads, middle-aged men who seemingly represent some faded era when there was a certain charm to being an asshole. We saw this same guy in Rushmore, in The Royal Tenenbaums, in The Life Aquatic. Unlike those three fine films, though, The Grand Budapest Hotel doesnÕt ever stop to really consider the man so vibrantly brought to life by Fiennes. It just keeps speeding along, assuming that weÕll love Gustave as much as Anderson does. IÕd say by pictureÕs end, we certainly like him. But thatÕs as far as IÕll go.
MoustafaÕs story involves a rich old dowager named Madame Desgoffe-und-Taxis (get it?), played by Tilda Swinton, who leaves a priceless painting, called ÒBoy With Apple,Ó to her beloved Gustave, angering her wicked son Dmitri (Adrien Brody). Conflict ensues, and a handful of characters cross our path, played by the likes of Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Willem Dafoe, and a criminally underused Saoirse Ronan. ItÕs a sprightly cast (though, as always in AndersonÕs films, it could use a few more women) and the story whips and whirls along engagingly. But it all feels É without a point. By now itÕs not all that novel to see a bunch of great actors speaking in AndersonÕs vernacular, moving brusquely around in his little dioramas. I really do like this European jewel box that Anderson has fashioned for all these great talents, but most of them have too little to do. Despite its starry cast and gorgeous aesthetics, The Grand Budapest Hotel ultimately feels disappointingly insubstantial.
Which brings me back to that chord of melancholy. ItÕs so enchanting, so intoxicating, that itÕs really easy to forget that it only fills the air at the very beginning and very end of the film. In some ways, these whispery moments, these tiny dollops of graceful sadness, are a cheat, a device to bring us into and take us out of the movie feeling like weÕve experienced something we really havenÕt. ThereÕs so much potential dwelling in the cozy, snowy, quaintly mysterious corners of Zubrowka, but Anderson whisks us by them like weÕre on a jam-packed student tour. I love the nostalgic Europe that Anderson has built here. I just wish he wanted to stay and look around a while as much as I did."
96,IFV_Doc6_TheGrandBudapestHotel,IFV,Comedy,Positive,The Grand Budapest Hotel,"Is it possible to make a semi-tragic wartime noir thatÕs shot primarily in shades of pastel? Judging from Wes AndersonÕs latest signature whimsy, The Grand Budapest Hotel, the answer is yes. By turns a whodunit, a prison-break movie, and an ode to high-end hotel conciergery, the movie is among AndersonÕs daffiest to date. (The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou has it beat by a nose.) Yet for all its visual baubles and deadpan comedy, it is shot through with nostalgia, melancholy, and deep echoes of historic loss. IÕm not sure that a confectionary fable set against so bleak a backdrop ought to succeed. But for me it did, brilliantly. The film opens with a series of narratives nested within narratives like Russian dolls. A girl in the present day pays tribute at the grave of a Central European author. Flash backward in time to the author himself (Tom Wilkinson) in 1985, explaining the genesis of his book The Grand Budapest Hotel. As a younger man (now played by Jude Law, who also inherits voiceover duties from Wilkinson), he had visited a hotel by that same name in 1968, a semi-defunct and virtually unpopulated hulk in the fictional nation of Zubrowka that had once served as a glamorous mountain retreat for the uppermost of the upper classes. There, he met the aging owner, Mr. Mustapha (F. Murray Abraham, who will take over narration duty for the bulk of the film), who described to him the hotelÕs shimmering heyday in the 1930s. Back then, Mr. Mustapha was a mere lobby boy, known as ÒZeroÓ (Tony Revolori), the pupil and protg of celebrated concierge Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes). Gustave is a prim and fussy perfectionistÑcopiously perfumed yet notably filthy of tongueÑwhose devotion to service includes, well, servicing the many rich, elderly ladies among the hotelÕs clientele. (ÒShe was 84,Ó Zero exclaims in disbelief when Gustave reveals one of his paramours. ÒIÕve had older,Ó Gustave replies breezily.) When one among GustaveÕs coterie of intimate acquaintances, Madame M. (Tilda Swinton, unrecognizable under wizening prosthetics), passes away, Gustave is summoned to her wake, where he discovers that she has bequeathed to him an invaluable painting entitled Boy with Apple. Madame M.Õs covetous progeny take this news poorly, in particular her malevolent son, Dmitri (Adrien Brody), who tasks his homicidally inclined bodyguard (Willem Dafoe) with reacquiring the portrait. Plots and counter-plots ensue, involving theft and murder, imprisonment and flight, secret societies and missing wills. AndersonÕs customary affectations are all very much in evidence: the marzipan palette; the finicky, meticulous compositions; the sentimental attachment to bygone relics, here ranging from macaroons and rotary phones to funicular trams and striped prison outfits. Also scattered ornamentally throughout the film are small roles for a great many members of AndersonÕs extended troupe, including (in addition to those already cited) Jeff Goldblum, Edward Norton, Harvey Keitel, Bill Murray, Bob Balaban, and Jason Schwartzman. Mathieu Amalric and Saoirse Ronan also make appearances, as an ill-fated domestic and as ZeroÕs oddly birthmarked love interest, respectively. Though few of these performers are offered very much to do, they complete AndersonÕs set dressing with great aplomb. As the fastidious yet feisty Gustave, Fiennes is a delight. Whether he is engineering the perfect stay for his hotel guests or making new friends in prison, there is an imperviousness to his solicitude. For all his delicate mannerismsÑhe addresses strangers as ÒchapsÓ and ÒdarlingsÓÑGustave possesses an underlying strength and dignity that suggest a farcical variation on Don CheadleÕs performance as Paul Rusesabagina in Hotel Rwanda. (Fiennes obtained the role of Gustave after Johnny Depp dropped out, leaving unanswered for now the question of whether an Anderson-Depp pairing would prove sublime or intolerable.) As the young Zero, Revolori is primarily the straight man, and he fulfills this obligation expertly, another in a series of young performers (along with Schwartzman in Rushmore and Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward in Moonrise Kingdom) ably directed by Anderson. And as our narrator, F. Murray Abraham reminds again, as he did last year in Inside Llewyn Davis, of the Hollywood vagaries that allowed someone of his extraordinary talent to all but vanish from the big screen for three decades. The comedy in The Grand Budapest Hotel is among the broadest yet undertaken by AndersonÑit includes, for instance, a cat being thrown out a windowÑand it hurtles toward the viewer with reckless velocity. There is much running and fighting and yelling and shooting. (And, yes, sledding.) But amid the frenzied hubbub, there are intimations of a darker, sadder history unfoldingÑin the dilapidation of the communist-era hotel in the frame narrative, and in the multiplying gangs of 1930s-era military police in the central story. This subtext becomes explicit as the tale of Gustave H. concludes with an unhappy swerve, and we return to the present-day girl paying her graveside respects under a leaden sky. For any who might have missed the cues, an onscreen coda describes the film as Òinspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig,Ó the Austrian Jewish writer who committed suicide in 1942 at the age of 60. Those who are not fans of Wes AndersonÕs workÑand some who areÑmay find this appropriation awkward or unearned. And indeed there are no Nazis or Soviets, per se, in AndersonÕs fable, any more than Zubrowka is a genuine place. But the mid-century sorrows of the real world tether the frivolities of AndersonÕs make-believe one, lending gravity to the wistfulness and the air of fading innocence that have been among the principal themes of his career. The Grand Budapest Hotel may not be AndersonÕs best filmÑthough it is among themÑbut it is, unexpectedly, perhaps his most grown up."
97,IFV_Doc7_TheGrandBudapestHotel,IFV,Comedy,Positive,The Grand Budapest Hotel,"ÒThe Grand Budapest Hotel,Ó by Wes Anderson, is a compulsively arranged sacher torte of a movie, an elegant mousetrap of stories-within-stories that invokes history with a temperament ranging from winsome to deeply mournful. As a carefully constructed miniaturized universe, ÒThe Grand Budapest HotelÓ is that most Andersonian of endeavors, evincing the deadpan drolleries, screwball action and dollhouse aesthetic that have alternately charmed and chagrined filmgoers for the past couple of decades.  Set in a castlelike hotel in the fictional Mitteleuropean country of Zubrowka on the eve of World War II, ÒThe Grand Budapest HotelÓ revolves Ñ like all of AndersonÕs films Ñ around a quirky middle-aged man and the precocious boy he takes under his wing. As such, the film fully engages one of the fascinating tensions that have always animated AndersonÕs fussily decorated cinematic jewel boxes, namely how one learns to become a man within a universe of characters so stylized and artfully concocted that they seem barely human. The great good fortune of ÒThe Grand Budapest HotelÓ is that the tutor in question is played by Ralph Fiennes, who lends a lambent sincerity to a character who can be charming and rather loathsome at the turn of a schilling. Monsieur Gustave H., concierge at the Budapest, is a smooth, sinuously manipulative epitome of his craft, especially when it comes to his elderly female guests Ñ who provide ample opportunity for Gustave to hone his gift for seduction and flattery. Those gifts are on view even when the recipient is dead, as we see when Gustave and a young lobby boy named Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori) embark on a fateful trip to honor a guestÕs memory, and wind up embroiled in a zany murder mystery that will take them from a spooky, taxidermy-filled mansion to a cartoonish prison break to a vertiginous ski-and-sled chase from a mountaintop monastery. Enlivened by such antic set pieces, ÒThe Grand Budapest HotelÓ finds Anderson at his most spirited and stylish: The story, told as a series of flashbacks, actually spans three distinct eras, each defined by its own color palette and aspect ratio (the 1930s sequences are set within the boxy, storybook-like frame of the time). Draped in extravagant shades of amber, rose and amethyst, as lovingly crafted and iced as the airy delicacies that Gustave eagerly devours from pink boxes tied with blue ribbons, ÒThe Grand Budapest HotelÓ bears AndersonÕs now-unmistakable signature of bespoke, unapologetic devotion to craftily ordered prettiness. The film also features cameos from AndersonÕs informal rep company, including Bill Murray, Bob Balaban, Owen Wilson and an almost unrecognizable Tilda Swinton, as well as newcomers to the club F. Murray Abraham, Jude Law and Saoirse Ronan, among several others. They make for a gifted gaggle of players, each blessed with a great face, and Anderson choreographs them with the assured hand of a pro. But itÕs Fiennes who provides the ballast Ñ the gravitas and ambiguous soul Ñ of an endeavor that otherwise makes a genteel, picturesque burlesque of Nazi-era anxieties. (According to an epigraph, ÒThe Grand Budapest HotelÓ was inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig, an Austrian author who fled the country when Hitler came to power and later took his own life.) Fiennes brings a magnificent sense of detail but also withholding to Gustave, who remains a cryptic figure Ñ sexually omni-oriented, civilized, refined, but also prone to vulgarities and casual cruelties (especially regarding women he regularly beds). In fact, ÒThe Grand Budapest HotelÓ is shot through with startling images of violence, from a character off-handedly discarding a dead pet in a trash can to the sight of someoneÕs recently disembodied fingers. ThereÕs also a brief glimpse of carnality that feels as shockingly out of place in a Wes Anderson film as a stop-motion fox might be in something by Michael Bay.  For all of his commitment to the finer things in life, Anderson is willing if not eager to indulge a fancy for the crude and grotesque, a juxtaposition that comes into even more curious play when he treats charactersÕ physical blemishes and deformities as mere elements, visual one-liners. Are the shoeshine boy with the prosthetic leg and the bakery girl with Òa port wine stain the shape of MexicoÓ on her face supposed to convey AndersonÕs humanism, or a more arch and sneakily contemptuous fetishistic tendency? Even though melancholy threads through ÒThe Grand Budapest Hotel,Ó itÕs not a particularly deep film. Comparisons have been made to the wartime comedies of Ernst Lubitsch, but Anderson hasnÕt created a playfully stinging satire as much as its softer mirror image. He convincingly mimics the gestures of the genre Ñ abhorrence of authoritarianism, not as a crime against humanity but as an affront to good taste and Old World etiquette Ñ but ultimately seems unable or unwilling to delve under the sumptuous surface and grapple with darker realities. Still, ÒThe Grand Budapest HotelÓ is as enchanting, well-appointed and smoothly run as its titular establishment, and Gustave earns the right to be called a genuinely tragic figure. If Anderson buries relatively little moral substance under lavish dollops of rich cream, at least he, like his fascinating protagonist, sustains the illusion with a marvelous grace."
98,IFV_Doc8_TheGrandBudapestHotel,IFV,Comedy,Positive,The Grand Budapest Hotel,"Chances are you've already made up your mind about Wes Anderson. Either you're willing to go with the meticulous symmetry of his dollhouse compositions, the precious tchotchke-filled design sensibility and the stilted formality of his dialogue, or you check out of his storybook worlds in the first five minutes. On the evidence of his eighth feature, The Grand Budapest Hotel, it's clear no one is more aware of his idiosyncracies than Anderson himself Ñ and he's not apologizing. Grand Budapest is a culmination of the tinkly music-box aesthetic of Anderson's work to date, turned up to 11. If you've already tuned out, all the two dimensional tracking shots, whip-pans, color coordination and stop-motion animation is going to come crashing down on you like a truckload of playfully plinking harpsichords. But if you meet Anderson on his terms, you'll reach the end and just want more.
The film's structure is a justification of the distant remove from anything resembling reality, with Anderson nesting the primary narrative within a series of framing stories. The primary tale is a zany caper set in the fictional Eastern European republic of Zubrowka, involving murder, stolen art, a prison break and a mountainside toboggan chase. At the center is Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes), concierge of the mountaintop resort of the title, and his lobby boy Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori). That plot unfolds in 1932, but it's a story that, in the film, is related as an oral history in the '60s, written as a book some years later, explained by the author in 1985, and finally, at the outermost level of this series of Russian nesting dolls, read in the present day by a young woman in a cemetery. If the film seems removed from reality, it's no wonder: It's being filtered through decades, multiple perspectives, artistic license and a heavy shroud of nostalgia. But then nostalgia has always weighed heavily on Anderson's work, and in Gustave, he's created a character even more attached to the past than he is. As the modern world creeps into Old Europe, the stately, exacting concierge constantly laments the lack of dignity and decorum of the advancing 20th century. This is a fact that, on the surface, seems at odds with his habit of sleeping with many of the hotel's elderly female guests, but for Gustave, this is both part of his enduring attachment to the past as well as a function of his hospitality. ""I sleep with all my friends,"" he says matter-of-factly at one point. His ongoing relationship with one of those friends, Madame D (a delightfully eccentric Tilda Swinton), becomes problematic when she turns up dead and her will leaves him a priceless painting. Her heirs Ñ a bickering bunch headed up by her son Dmitri (Adrien Brody) and thug-for-hire Jopling (Willem Dafoe) Ñ are none too pleased, and frame Gustave for the crime. Anderson is well aware that there's great humor to be found in the mismatch between Gustave's Old World gentility and his promiscuity Ñ not to mention his frequent bursts of profanity. Fiennes, a new addition to Anderson's usual stable of actors, proves perfectly suited to the director's arid comic timing, and the result is, in terms of volume and effectiveness of jokes, far and away Anderson's funniest film. He expertly mines the film's contrasting inclinations, making violent and often shockingly bloody jokes. Like much of early-'30s Europe, Zubrowka is on the brink of a fascist takeover, and Grand Budapest has some of the best Nazi-inspired humor since Mel Brooks' ""Springtime for Hitler."" There's so much going on here, a constant stream of jokes, plot contrivances, film references, and images overladen with gorgeous detail, that it might all collapse in on itself if not for the relationship between Gustave and his young protg Zero. For those playing at home, this checks another box off on the Wes Anderson bingo card Ñ his recurring theme of the bond between surrogate fathers and sons. More important, it gives the movie a beating heart beneath layer upon layer of careful and distancing artifice. There's much to admire on the surface of The Grand Budapest Hotel, but as with all of Anderson's best work, what lasts are the emotional notes it hits, almost invisibly. As Monsieur Gustave would surely agree, the mark of an expert lobby boy is to provide what the hotel's guests need without their ever knowing he was there. "
99,IFV_Doc9_TheGrandBudapestHotel,IFV,Comedy,Positive,The Grand Budapest Hotel,"No one crafts characters, worlds, and stories quite like Wes Anderson. In ÒThe Grand Budapest Hotel,Ó the director constructs each scene like a cityscape or portrait, filling his environments with lavish dcor and hypnotic personas before incorporating in his sensationally rhetorical brand of dialogue. While the events that take place often seem random, nothing is arbitrary in the visuals. From the cycling aspect ratio and frequent camera pans to the careful positioning and quantity of people within the frame, everything is meticulously planned and organized. ÒThe Grand Budapest HotelÓ offers an even higher sum of participants than the directorÕs already actor-heavy oeuvre, and includes cameos from a host of brilliant performers that complement the exceptional central turns by Ralph Fiennes and newcomer Tony Revolori. Though the works of author Stefan Zweig may inspire the momentous dupery, the film is unmistakably Wes Anderson. While staying at the once-grand Budapest Hotel, a young writer (Jude Law) happens upon the elusive owner (F. Murray Abraham), who subsequently invites him to dinner to recount the captivating tale of how he came to acquire the establishment. Beginning as a humble lobby boy at the Budapest Hotel, Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori) becomes the protg of liberally perfumed and widely revered concierge M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). When Gustave is accused of murdering a wealthy heiress and is sent to prison, Zero aids in his escape, forcing the duo to attempt to clear the managerÕs name while outwitting both the policeman (Edward Norton) pursuing them and the ruthless killer (Willem Dafoe) tasked with silencing any who would reveal the truth. If Tarantino is the contemporary master of cinematic dialogue, Wes Anderson is a close second Ð like a moderately cleaned-up version of Tarantino filtered through Billy Wilder, Preston Sturges, and Sidney Buchman. A whimsical, consistently poetic vibe permeates every exchange, with heavy narration frequently drowning out the actual conversations of characters onscreen. Anderson is an absolute master of infusing quirkiness and idiosyncrasies into borderline slapstick activities, where each scene or chapter is a fresh examination of a ceaseless introduction to additional characters. Like the films of Caro and Jeunet, many of the personalities feel as if theyÕre being portrayed through a fisheye lens, skewed disproportionately into delightfully singular creations. Here, perhaps borrowing from Tarantino, the story is told out of order, with numerous stops through time, broken into chapters. The story involves murder, an inheritance, tumultuous political climates, romance, a heist, a mystery, a prison break, and all manner of trekking across the picturesque countryside. But itÕs the technical elements that share (or overtake) the spotlight, with AndersonÕs careful framing an odd endeavor in nearly removing the three-dimensionality of motion picture, where actors move from side to side, converse face to face (with the camera cutting back and forth between speakers), and are centered in the middle of vast landscapes and environments, and where actions shift into frame in fixed positions. The structure of the story parallels the motif of frames and framing, with bookending raconteurs and narratives enclosing the retelling of the primary adventures. Expressions communicate without speech, every movement is purposeful, background elements have specific meanings, and colors are vibrant and cartoonish. The attention to detail is simply phenomenal. From the first few seconds, itÕs evident that each aspect is also tinged with humor Ð some from outrageously unrealistic concepts, but most from the subtle ridiculousness of words, images, and character designs. Instead of movie frames, the film appears comprised of a series of paintings, each one crafted with wondrous minutia and a recognizable cast having as much fun as viewers. Not a second is wasted on presenting a nearly perfect blend of visual artistry with a funnily fanciful fabulist."
100,IFV_Doc10_TheGrandBudapestHotel,IFV,Comedy,Positive,The Grand Budapest Hotel,"An odd thought occurred to me a few hours after I saw writer/director Wes Anderson's ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" for the first time. It was that Anderson would be the ideal director for a film of ""Lolita,"" or a mini-series of ""Ada."" Now I know that ""Lolita"" has been filmed, twice, but the fundamental problem with each version has nothing to do with ability to depict or handle risky content but with a fundamental misapprehension that Nabokov's famous novel took place in the ""real world."" For all the authentic horror and tragedy of its story, it does not. ""I am thinking of aurochs and angels, the secret of durable pigments, prophetic sonnets, the refuge of art,"" Humbert Humbert, the book's monstrous protagonist/narrator, writes at the end of ""Lolita."" Nabokov created Humbert so Humbert might create his own world (with a combination of detail both geographically verifiable and stealthily fanciful), a refuge from his own wrongdoing.  ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" uses a not dissimilar narrative stratagem, a nesting-doll contrivance conveyed in a blink-and-you'll-miss-a-crucial-part-of-it opening. A young lady visits a park and gazes at a bust of a beloved ""Author,"" who is then made flesh in the person of Tom Wilkinson, who then recalls his younger self in the person of Jude Law, who then recounts his meeting with Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham), the owner of the title hotel. Said hotel is a legendary edifice falling into obsolescence, and Law's ""Author"" is curious as to why the immensely wealthy Moustafa chooses to bunk in a practically closet-size room on his yearly visits to the place. Over dinner. Moustafa deigns to satisfy the writer's curiosity, telling him of his apprenticeship under the hotel's one-time concierge, M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). All of this material is conveyed not just in the standard Wes Anderson style, e.g., meticulously composed and designed shots with precise and very constricted camera movements. In ""Hotel"" Anderson's refinement of his particular moviemaking mode is so distinct that his debut feature, the hardly unstylized ""Bottle Rocket,"" looks like a Cassavetes picture by comparison. So, to answer some folks who claim to enjoy Anderson's movies while also grousing that they wish he would apply his cinematic talents in a ""different"" mode: no, this isn't the movie in which he does what you think you want, whatever that is. What he does is his own thing, which in terms of achievement is on a similar level of difficulty to what Nabokov kept upping the ante on in his English-language novels: to conjure poignancy and tragedy in the context of realms spun off from but also fancifully, madly removed from dirt-under-your-fingernails ""reality."" M. Gustave is a didact of high-level service, schooling young Zero Moustafa in the art of understanding what a guest wants, and getting it to the guest, before the guest has even thought of it. He wears a scent called ""Eau de Panache."" He's also a ludicrous horndog and gigolo, and his troubles begin when the wealthiest of his dowagers (Tilda Swinton) dies and leaves him a strange painting. The dowager's impossibly evil son (Adrian Brody) wishes M. Gustave to get nothing, and will stop at nothing to see to that. His determination sets into motion a series of intimidations and assaults that's complicated by the rise of an ostensibly Fascist power in the often-candy-colored Middle-Europe Bohemian Theme Park Anderson and his production designers conjure up here. (Since I've invoked Nabokov twice in this review, I really ought to emphasize that the movie itself credits the writings of Stefan Zweig, the Austrian writer whose wry, poignant autobiography was titled ""The World of Yesterday,"" as a primary inspiration.) The dialogue is contemporary American, with plenty of cursing; the action is often grisly slapstick, with an upping of the imperiled-animal quotient that provided one of the more disquieting scenes of Anderson's last feature, ""Moonrise Kingdom."" The references are multitudinous, and come from everywhere (one of my favorites is a cable car sequence nodding to Carol Reed's 1940 thriller ""Night Train To Munich""). The cast is the usual top-to-bottom array of incredible talent, including, aside from the aforementioned, Matthew Amalric, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, Saoirse Ronan, La Seydoux, and Anderson stalwarts Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, and Owen Wilson. (Newcomer Tony Revolori plays the young Moustafa.) The settings include not just the hotel but also a dank prison, a heavenly bakeshop, and all manner of horse drawn or steam-driven conveyances.  Although it's packed with incident, there's a stillness to the film that makes looking at it feel as if you're staring at a zoetrope image of a snow globe, while at the same time a stray epithet here or the spectacle of some severed digits there pulls in a different direction, suggesting Anderson's conjured world is subject to tensions that exist entirely outside of it, calling attention to that which is unseen on the screen: an anxious creator who wants everything just so, but can't control the intrusion of vulgarity or cruelty. This tension is reflected in the character of M. Gustave himself, whose air of refinement masks a boyish exuberance and vulgarity, and who is nevertheless revealed at the movie's end to be a human being of absolute nobility. As much as ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" takes on the aspect of a cinematic confection, it does so to grapple with the very raw and, yes, real stuff of humanity from an unusual but highly illuminating angle. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a movie about the masks we conjure to suit our aspirations, and the cost of keeping up appearances. ""He certainly maintained the illusion with remarkable grace,"" one character remarks admiringly of another near the end of the movie. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" suggests that sometimes, as a species, that's the best we can do. Anderson the illusion-maker is more than graceful, he's dazzling, and with this movie he's created an art-refuge that consoles and commiserates. It's an illusion, but it's not a lie."
101,DLJ_Doc1_Hereditary,Donjo,Horror,Positive,Hereditary,"Hereditary builds scares like a Conjuring-grade funhouse movie, tightening moments until a jump scare—that single moment of spiking, adrenaline-squirting fright—would almost be relief. But then something different happens. Instead of looking for you to yelp, Hereditary stabs a disturbing emotion into your gut. More than being scary (though it is scary), Hereditary is upsetting. Rather than creeping dread (though there is creeping dread), Hereditary feels like an endless drawing out of that queasy, shocking, falling dream sensation, as the ground beneath the Graham family, and the viewer, crumbles.

We are introduced to the Grahams in an obituary, announcing the death of family matriarch Ellen in the antiseptic language unique to the form, which both reveals a family's structure and obscures how those components interact, live and feel. We learn, for example, that Ellen's son, brother to Annie (Toni Collette), preceded her in death, gesturing toward tragedy but failing to illuminate it. It's only later, as Annie breaks down in front of a grief support group, that this single line in an obituary inflates into the dreadful shape of familial mental illness, self-destruction and suicide. That the horrific deaths of her brother and father work simultaneously as a gut-wrenching reality and supernatural foreshadowing is just one way Hereditary layers human and horror dramas atop each other to jaw-clenching effect.

Annie is an artist who builds tiny dioramas, mostly of domestic scenes, though shocking events soon find their way into her art. If interactions with her son devolve into icy silence and screaming fights, Annie can always enshrine a terrible family moment in the perfect stillness of her work.

Her children, Charlie (Milly Shapiro) and Peter (Alex Wolff), are familiar varieties of troubled. Charlie is too shy and a little morbid, creating disjointed figures out of dead animal parts and household items—twisted versions of her mother's artistic work, the daughter an exaggerated recursion of the parent. Peter is a pothead and your typical teenage misanthrope. And while Charlie's unnerving stare and habitual mouth *click* definitely put her on the creepy kid spectrum, the Hereditary family is, at least at first, relatable in its dysfunction, with only Annie's sleepwalking (which occasionally enacts her suppressed regrets at having children) and the specter of Ellen indicating problems more dangerous than those typical of millions of households.
Shortly after Ellen's funeral, her grave is desecrated. And while it's little more than a narrative aside, bundled away by the family's taciturn and conflict-smoothing father, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), it's also our first indication that something much more than family drama and unhatched mental illness is at play. When Annie bumps into a woman who offers to put her in touch with the dead—an offer extended with the same neighborly hominess as a plate of brownies—their problems escalate from merely tragic into occult realms of terror, where familial peccadilloes become fuel for inhuman powers.
It's easiest to describe Hereditary as a dark family drama turned deadly—something like Stoker, or The Squid and the Whale with mortification of the flesh (speaking of, Hellraiser isn't a bad comparison point)—because to do much more would be to spoil what happens when Hereditary flips from simmering to skin-charring. The devastating consequences of family strife, where every word is intimate enough to wound, is an essential portion of Hereditary's poisoned supper, but there's quite a lot of traditional horror pleasures as well.

Even beyond the well-tuned scares and exceptional script, writer-director Ari Aster demonstrates a rare conceptual mastery in Hereditary. From the very beginning, where we are first shown a tree house, then zoom into the dollhouse bedroom of one of Annie's sculptures, Hereditary insinuates overlapping, entangled and conflicting thematic concerns. The viewer becomes a voyeur, watching characters twist in their torment from a godlike vantage. People are represented as individuals while being simultaneously boxed in by circumstance, personal limitations and, yes, the burdens of heredity. Quasi-spaces, like the tree house, reveal twisted parodies of real life. Nested realities encircle and inform one another, each with their own, limited perspectives on the reality above, from Annie's sculpture to the household to society to the cosmic oververse where forces beyond death plot against us. ""It's a neutral view of the accident!"" Annie says, in protest, when her husband objects to a morbid new art project (as scary as Hereditary is, it also hits fantastic black comedy beats). Hereditary is dense with the symbolic, far beyond its smattering of occult iconography, but never feels showy or burdened with meaning.
Anchored by exceptional performances—particularly from Collette as Annie, who rips apart reality with her shrieks, cries and piercing stares—Hereditary is the best horror movie of the year so far. As an in-theater experience, it's unparalleled, the kind of movie that will have people stuffing their sleeves in their mouths to stifle moans. But it's just as exciting to imagine how Hereditary will age, because it's after more than momentary shocks. Hereditary is the rare movie that will, if enough people see it, infect the public subconscious for decades.

102,DLJ_Doc2_Hereditary,Donjo,Horror,Positive,Hereditary,"Ari Aster’s unnerving and artful debut stars Toni Collette as a woman tormented by her own mother’s terrifying legacy, and uses a palette of haunted-house tropes to keep the audience guessing until the end.

A family has lost its head. The text that serves as a formal prologue to Hereditary announces the passing of 78-year-old matriarch Ellen Taper Leigh in the home of her daughter Annie Graham, after a prolonged illness. “She will be missed,” are the words that close the obituary – but there is little evidence that Ellen’s estranged family really do miss her. Annie (Toni Collette, travelling convincingly through a range of nuanced emotions) delivers a tactful eulogy that not only stresses Ellen’s secrecy but is also clearly straining to keep hidden the difficulties of Ellen’s personality. Annie’s husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) and teenage son Pete (Alex Wolff) seem barely to care – and if Pete’s 13-year-old sister Charlie (Milly Shapiro) was without question Ellen’s favourite, she is herself a strange, troubled child, too affectless to express any notion of loss.

Hereditary opens with a long, fluid take of three different but proximate houses, as Pawel Pogorzelski’s slow-spinning, sinuous cinematography first reveals a treehouse (also the film’s final image) seen across the garden through a window, then pulls back from the window to show an artist’s workroom within the house opposite, and finally pans over the workroom to a table bearing a scale model of the house (with the wall removed from the front to expose the elaborately crafted interior). As the camera moves closer to a bedroom in the model, and to a figurine lying in the minibed, we hear a knock, and – impossibly – Steve walks right in to wake Pete for Ellen’s funeral.

This uncanny trick of blurring a scale model with the larger reality is something that has been seen before in films with themes significantly parallel to Hereditary’s, whether the facsimile of the school in Nick Murphy’s The Awakening (2011), which similarly stages the burden of grief, the persistence of the dead and the seductiveness of delusion, or the display model of the labyrinth in Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining (1980), which also pits child against unravelling adult. Yet in opening with this lifelike doll’s house, constructed by artist Annie to work – in microcosm – through her family’s long, tragic history and her own difficult relationship with Ellen, debut writer/director Ari Aster establishes two things: first, the uneasy sense, right from the start, that the Grahams are somebody else’s playthings, like the dolls that Charlie collects; and second, that this mood of play-box paranoia, introducing tension at the outset and from then on never once relenting, will be managed with the sort of painstaking attention to domestic minutiae that Annie herself brings to her art. In these layerings of houses within houses, and in the dreams within dreams (Annie’s, Pete’s) that will soon interpolate themselves into the narrative’s reality, Aster merges naturalism with unnerving allegory to present an increasingly hallucinatory family portrait in which the psychological is reified and the devil is in the details.

The strange graffiti etched into the Grahams’ wallpaper – and of course reproduced by Annie in miniature – can be recognised as the writing on the wall for a dysfunctional clan whose suppressed demons must eventually out. Still, Aster will take his time parcelling out all their tortuous secrets, compartmentalised within the bourgeois veneer of suburban life, or hidden in plain sight in boxes, lofts and images. Though primed to expect that Ellen’s legacy, genetic or otherwise, must come home to roost, viewers are kept in excruciating suspense as to what precise form it will take, as recurring motifs of fire and decapitation, dissociative identity disorder and ritual beleaguer the film’s structure in a campaign of confusion. Aster throws in a whole palette of haunted-house tropes (seances and spectres, creaky corridor and creepy attic, infestations of ants and flies) as much to confound as to clarify, given that we are being misdirected no less than the Grahams are being carefully manipulated.
The big reveal, when it comes, is played with a disarming literalness – but its unhinged irrationality also makes it an effective and affecting metaphor for a family’s inheritance of guilt, recrimination and madness. Aster’s artistry here is phenomenally assured, even classical, as he deftly mixes subgenres, while focusing more on his bewildered characters than on the horrors that either they or we can see (often as blurs or shadows). Hereditary might be regarded as a psychological or supernatural thriller, an insidious ghost story, a literal cult movie, or Rosemary’s Baby (1968) after the infant has come of age. On any view, it is a diabolically assured debut.

"
103,DLJ_Doc3_Hereditary,Donjo,Horror,Positive,Hereditary,"A painful sense of impending dread fills every frame of Ari Aster’s searing cinematic debut.
To quote the immortal words of Philip Larkin: “They fuck you up, your mum and dad. They may not mean to, but they do.” This poetic indictment of familial relationships is brought to mind by Ari Aster’s searing cinematic debut, Hereditary, in which the members of a middle-class, ostensibly normal family come to terms with the death of a relative and face the strange days that follow her funeral.
This unfortunate clan are the Grahams, consisting of artist Annie (Toni Collette), her husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) and their two children, Peter (Alex Wolff) and Charlie (Milly Shapiro). Annie works as a miniaturist. She creates exquisite small-scale renderings of real-life scenarios which provide a crucial anchor to the story: as she contends with an impending gallery deadline as well as her mother’s passing, it becomes clear that – as in her work – the devil is in the detail.
And what details there are to behold in the performances, chiefly from Collette as the frantic, fractured woman battling internal demons and the very real possibility of external ones too. She’s gamely joined by Byrne, who gives a subtle, stern performance as her increasingly exasperated husband Steve, and impressive young’uns Alex Wolff and Milly Shapiro who hold their own as the Graham siblings. Wolff in particular has a striking vulnerability about him – rather than playing up a teenage archetype, he’s wide-eyed and terrified; a messy, shrieking, infinitely relatable adolescent loser.

The film’s intricate construction is complemented by Colin Stetson’s unsettling Gaslini-adjacent score, and a rich, heavily-saturated colour palette that works in stark contrast with the progressively more eerie action that plays out against the small-town sunshine. In the age of the obligatory jump scare there are grizzly scenes aplenty, but Aster prefers a painful sense of impending dread which begins with the opening shot and refuses to rescind its grip until the final credits.
It’s possible to identify subtle cinematic nods to the likes of Don’t Look Now and The Shining – notably in Shapiro’s unnerving portrayal of a creepy kid at odds with the rest of her family (complete with an orange hoodie as unexpectedly haunting as Christine Baxter’s red mac). Pawel Pogorzelski’s crisp, ethereal cinematography seems influenced by John Alcott’s iconic work with Kubrick. Rather than a derivative exercise in genre scalping, there’s something fresh about the masterful way in which Aster examines the insidious nature of suburban inertia while playing on the very real fear of what we inherit from our parents, and in turn, what we pass onto future generations, willfully or not.
Part relationship psychodrama, part ghost story, part exploration of inherited madness, Hereditary is a film which refuses to parlay into a set definition of horror, which is its twisting, slippery strength. It begs to be rewatched, reconsumed and resurrected so that some part of its spiraling weirdness might become more familiar. Although there’s plenty of unsettling imagery present that’s liable to haunt audiences for years to come, it’s Aster’s thematic ambition which transforms it into a smiling, intoxicating villain of a film that gets under your skin and sinks into the marrow of your bones."
104,DLJ_Doc4_Hereditary,Donjo,Horror,Positive,Hereditary,"Hereditary is not for the faint of heart. Honestly, we really mean it. But not in the sense that it might loudly jump-scare you into cardiac arrest. Ari Aster’s feature debut has its thorax-tightening shock moments, but they are rare (and all the more effective for it). Primarily, it takes the crawling-dread approach to horror, often serving up its most chilling shriek-treats before you even notice they’re right there in front of you.
One scene, for example, presents a character in the gloom of a midnight-shrouded room. As they sit up in their bed, carefully positioned in the lower left of Asters’ frame, you know right down to your bones that something isn’t right here. But you’re not seeing it. Then, perhaps, someone sitting nearby you will gasp, their sudden inhalation flagging they’ve spotted it before you. You look closer, your eyes darting around the frame’s dark edges and darker corners. You kinda don’t want to. But you’re compelled to. And then. Oh. Ohhh no. You see… It.

Aster might be a first-time writer-director, but he is clearly a natural-born master of horror. Otherwise, we can only assume that The Wicker Man was playing on loop in his maternity ward, that he effectively grew up in Room 237 of the Overlook Hotel and visually mainlined Hideo Nakata’s Ringu throughout his teen years. We wouldn’t be surprised if his mother’s name is Rosemary, either.
Hereditary wears its influences well, feeling inspired rather than derivative. Aster plays with a lot of recognisable ideas and tropes, but moulds them into something that hits you with minty-death freshness. There are pagan symbols and invocations. There are candle-lit séances. And as we already mentioned, there are terrible, terrible things lurking in those shadows. But he wraps it all up in a slow-burn story that plays on familiar insecurities — primarily the question of who to blame for our shortcomings: our parents? Ourselves? Or… something else?
It’s all presented with gorgeous Kubrickian precision and elegant trompe-l’oeil techniques, from a creep-zoom opening into the room of a model house (which then imperceptibly, unsettlingly transitions into the real thing), to the long, single-take glides around the Graham family’s harried home, to the reflection of hell-red lights in one character’s teary eyes, to the stab-quick cuts that lurch us from night to day and back again as Aster slices up time like a sushi chef.

A doomy, electronic pulse lurks low in the sound mix for most of the film, making you sit uncomfortably even when what’s happening on screen appears innocent or mundane. Aster never grants his audience any relief. There are no ‘oh it’s just a cat’ pressure releases in Hereditary. Everything is steeped in threat. Especially the places where you should feel safest.
He’s marshalled an impressive cast, too. The youngest Graham, 13-year-old Charlie, is portrayed by newcomer Milly Shapiro in a way that somehow simultaneously elicits sympathy and deep-set disquiet. Alex Wolff (Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle) sensitively portrays her older brother Peter as a teen who is, in a sense, un-coming of age — his traumas devolving him from bong-smoking slacker to squalling child, as you imagine they would anyone at his psychologically brittle stage of life.

Gabriel Byrne is suitably solid in the role of the steady, uninteresting, keeping-it-all-together (and failing) dad Steve. And as for Toni Collette in the lead role of Annie, Aster really puts her through the wringer, inflicting on his star-sufferer woes comparable with those suffered by both Essie Davis in 2014’s The Babadook and Ellen Burstyn in The Exorcist. Combined. Her screen-filling, straight-to-camera looks of sheer, unfiltered terror will likely stay with you for as long as many of Hereditary’s other scares. Which are numerous, relentless and never less than insomnia-invitingly intense.

105,DLJ_Doc5_Hereditary,Donjo,Horror,Positive,Hereditary,"A great horror movie terrifies you more after you leave the theatre. It imparts a sense of dread that lingers in the mind, longer than any jump scare on the screen.
Hereditary is a great horror movie. Ari Aster’s feature debut, boasting an extraordinary performance by Toni Collette as a mother under siege (remember her at awards time), tracks the course of malign acts visited upon the Graham family, whose members are attempting to live quiet lives in an affluent Pacific Northwest town.
The Grahams become innocent targets of evil, but perhaps not unsuspecting ones. When family matriarch Ellen dies at age 78 after a long decline through dementia, her daughter Annie (Collette) strangely eulogizes her as “a very secretive woman” who would have felt a sense of “betrayal” to be talked about at a funeral service.

Annie doesn’t exactly mourn her mother’s passing — “Should I feel sadder?” she asks someone — but she joins a grief support group anyway, befriending a kindly woman named Joan (Ann Dowd). Annie blurts out to the group a history of family tragedy: the suicides of her brother and father, one through hanging and the other through starvation.
This traumatic past helps explain Annie’s unusual occupation: she makes miniature dollhouses and dolls that mimic real-life occurrences and people in the Graham household, including Ellen’s hospice care prior to her death. Annie evidently seeks to control through her art what she can’t control in her life. (These miniature dioramas, which function as both flashbacks and foreshadowing of events in the movie, were crafted by Toronto artist Steve Newburn.)
Annie’s aloof psychotherapist husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) seems of little comfort, caught up in caring for his many patients. The couple’s teenaged son Peter (Alex Wolff) and 13-year-old daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro) have also retreated into their own realms. Their default stares range from indifference to anger.

Peter, a quiet stoner, is apparently unruffled by recent events. Charlie, an intense brooder, is quite the opposite. Grandma’s death has prompted her to fill a sketchpad with violent drawings and to fashion miniature models out of found objects — including a dead bird’s head she snaps off with scissors — that signal troubling obsessions. She spends much of her day and most of her nights in a treehouse directly across from the family home.
Charlie has the eccentric habit of making a clucking sound that signifies everything and nothing. It’s part of the film’s unsettling sound design, which composer Colin Stetson ratchets up to full creep mode with a soundtrack that freezes the heart. Cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski, meanwhile, moves the camera like a cat stalking its prey, silently gliding through half-lit rooms.
It may seem that the Grahams have already endured more than their share of unhappiness. How tragically untrue this proves to be. Writer/director Aster is determined to plunge them into further misery, but he does so with the best of horrific intentions and with a savant’s taste for cinema — think In the Bedroom, Rosemary’s Baby, The Witch and so much more.
Aster’s particular fascination is the quotidian family that hides dark secrets, something readily glommed if you view his 2011 short The Strange Thing About the Johnsons on YouTube.
With Hereditary, he’s not trying to reinvent the squeal — we’ve all seen many horror movies about a family battling an indefinable threat. What Aster seeks to do is to transition us from hearth to hell in a manner that will disturb the mind long after the last anguished image flickers from the screen. His success is your nightmare."
106,DLJ_Doc6_Hereditary,Donjo,Horror,Negative,Hereditary,"To the extent that slow-burn horror movies are about atmosphere, Hereditary has many of them beaten. Using the camerawork of Pawel Pogorzelski and the music of Colin Stetson to fashion the skeleton of a superbly moody background, first-time director Ari Aster hits a home run when it comes to an overall sense of impending doom. Sadly, Aster’s story isn’t as waterproof as his stylistic aptitude. Riddled with logical problems and plagued with a weird wtf? ending (that comes dangerously close to recalling the absurdities of mother!), the narrative skids off the track around the 3/4 mark and never recovers from the derailment. The plot contortions might all make sense during a second viewing but, with its deliberate pace, this isn’t a film many people will be in a hurry to revisit.
When a movie is established as transpiring in the “real world,” it is incumbent on the filmmakers to adhere to basic, realistic logic in developing the narrative. For a film with supernatural elements, one expects that ghosts and other paranormal apparitions might be involved – those things are essential to the story. On the other hand, the movie shouldn’t shrug off mundane things. If an accident occurs that results in severe injury or death, one expects police involvement. What’s more, this shouldn’t just be swept under the rug until it becomes convenient to have a conversation about it. Problems of this nature undermine Hereditary’s credibility and damage our ability to take the characters and their situations seriously.
The movie focuses on a strange and insular family, the Grahams. At the start of the proceedings, Annie Graham (Toni Collette) is preparing to bury her mother. Her husband, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), and teenage son, Peter (Alex Wolff), are grave, but neither seems especially upset. The only one broken up about Grandma’s death is Charlie (Milly Shapiro), Peter’s 13-year old sister. Those hoping for a whiff of ghosts or hauntings will have to wait a while. In fact, nothing especially odd happens for about the first hour as the movie toys with our expectations, loads up on claustrophobia and eeriness, and gives us time to get to know the characters as they endure yet another tragedy. For a while, it almost seems like Hereditary is some kind of modern gothic drama, although the characters seem strangely muted and unreal. It’s hard to say whether this helps or hurts when things start going bump in the night.
Toni Collette’s committed performance helps to sell the movie even during its most unconvincing moments. Colette is one of a select number of currently working actresses who can play almost any role in any genre, whether it’s comedy, drama, or horror. Her face-off with Alex Wolff during the most uncomfortable dinner scene in any recent movie is a testimony to her ability to own the screen. Wolff and Gabriel Byrne are solid, although the script doesn’t do them any favors by forcing their characters to react irrationally in both normal and extreme situations. Some (mostly inferior) horror movies thrive on characters doing stupid things; this isn’t one of those. Hereditary wants to be taken seriously so when it jettisons real-world concerns to force its otherworldly agenda, it hurts the film.
Hereditary is never more than passingly frightening. The jump-scare count is low. However, although the slow-burn approach works well for a while, it ultimately goes on for too long. Momentum flags as the running length approaches (and eventually goes beyond) two hours. I can’t go into specifics about why the ending doesn’t work without spewing out spoilers (which I won’t do) but suffice it to say the change in tone causes whiplash and the level of weirdness throttles the well-modulated, low-key style favored by Aster during the first 110 minutes. Poorly constructed endings can leave an unpleasant aftertaste even for movies that are otherwise mostly solid. That’s the case here."
107,DLJ_Doc7_Hereditary,Donjo,Horror,Negative,Hereditary,"There’s no denying the frequent blunt-force effectiveness of writer-director Ari Aster’s smugly agitating feature debut, Hereditary, which begins with a showoffy shot that slowly rotates around the studio of professional diorama artist Annie Graham (Toni Collette). The camera eventually pushes into one of Annie’s models, which imperceptibly becomes a life-size bedroom inhabited by her husband, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), and their pothead son, Peter (Alex Wolff). This isn’t the last time spaces, and the spaces within them, will be utilized in unnerving, disorienting fashion. (Note, for instance, the many establishing shots of the Grahams’ isolated woodland home that alternate between real-world and miniature exteriors.) Yet the overall effect is gloomy and humorless, as if Aster is doing a stone-faced gloss on the Wes Anderson-parodying SNL skit “The Midnight Coterie of Sinister Intruders.”
Aster is clearly out to mirror his protagonist’s volatile headspace with such disruptive visuals. Annie is reeling from the death of her mother, whom she never much liked but who still had a—hint, hint—bewitching effect on the family. It’s been barely a week since the woman’s burial and everyone is still on edge. Annie throws herself into prep for a gallery show and reluctantly attends a grief support group to blow off steam. Steve gets a call from the cemetery where Annie’s mom is interred and hides some upsetting news from his wife: that the woman’s grave has been desecrated. And Peter acts the rebelliously dazed and confused adolescent, though there’s something amiss in his glazed expression, as if dope isn’t the only demon on his shoulder.
It certainly would be easiest to blame a Satanic influence for the fateful night when Annie forces Peter to take his sickly, mentally challenged younger sister, Charlie (Milly Shapiro)—whose habit of clucking her tongue occasions a few memorable jump scares—to a high school party. Charlie has an allergic reaction after eating a piece of cake with nuts in it. Spaced-out Peter rushes her to his car, hightailing it for a hospital. And then something gruesome occurs that pushes an already troubled brood into a deranged red zone.
This section of Hereditary impressively puts any supernatural sturm und drang on the back burner and unflinchingly charts the fraying family bonds. There are a few snake-tongued confrontations between Annie and Peter that are particularly bracing as long-held resentments come to the fore, such as Annie’s revulsion at ever having children in the first place. Collette’s jittery performance is on the fine line between ridiculous and sublime, and she’s best suited to these scenes in which the horrors her character faces are of the shadowy variety, the paranormal occurrences seeming to spring from a psychologically tangible and turbulent place. Is Annie actually seeing her dead mother in a dark corner of the room, for example, or is it a mere manifestation of her fractured subconscious? It’s best left imprecise.
Once it becomes apparent that the Graham family truly is a target of otherworldly malevolence, however, the film loses its menacing power and becomes a monotonous schlockfest. If the images and sounds maintain a baseline competence—a dread-inducing hum underscores a number of scenes, and the climax goes inventively topsy-turvy with the laws of gravity—they never seem anything other than derivative. Aster’s influences are legion, from The Exorcist (an evil spirit literally and figuratively tearing a family apart) to Onibaba (specters hiding near-subliminally in the darkness). But the film’s patron saint is Roman Polanski, the holy text Rosemary’s Baby. A shamelessly shifty Ann Dowd, overdoing the “is she or isn’t she evil?” act as an occult-obsessed acquaintance from Annie’s therapy group, is essentially Ruth Gordon 2.0. And Hereditary’s resoundingly silly conclusion reworks the subtle Mephistophelean poignancy of Rosemary’s Baby’s finale into a shallow, Shyamalan-lite reveal that negates the story’s fevered emotional undercurrents. The devil is certainly in these hackneyed details.
"
108,DLJ_Doc8_Hereditary,Donjo,Horror,Negative,Hereditary,"Hereditary is the horror film that has been described as a ‘ride of pure terror’ and likened to The Exorcist and Rosemary’s Baby and The Shining, to which I can say only: in its dreams. Given I’m such a wuss when it comes to anything frightening — the child-catcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang still scares the living daylights out of me — I’m rather thankful, but I’m perplexed as to why it received such rave reviews. Ride of pure terror? I’ve had more terrifying rides on the teacups at the fair. I saw it at the paying cinema with my adult son and his girlfriend, who were also bored out of their minds and could only conclude that ‘all other critics are idiots’. This is as I’ve long suspected, but it’s useful to have it confirmed.
Written and directed by Ari Aster, Hereditary stars an overwrought Toni Collette as Annie, whose mother, Ellen, has just died. Annie had a difficult relationship with Ellen and I initially thought the scene was being set for a horror spin on ambivalent motherhood, which could have been interesting, but I was wrong. Unlike, for example, Get Out, which was clever and made a point, this never felt anything other than pointless. Stuff certainly happens after Ellen’s death. Symbols and signs appear. A book on spiritualism is discovered. Ellen’s grave is desecrated. But they occur flatly, as if being ticked off some shopping list.
Ride of pure terror? I've had more terrifying rides on the teacups at the fair
The film is packed with tropes and clichés: a house in the woods, dead birds, a locked room, a creepy attic. These are knowing but there are others that, one suspects, aren’t knowing at all, and feed into one particular old chestnut: men are calmly sane while women are always hysterical. So Annie is the hysterical one, as is her 13-year-old daughter (Milly Shapiro), who goes all spooky and starts making clucking sounds. She also has an older son, Peter (Alex Wolff), who is not similarly afflicted — he’s a typical weed-smoking teenage slacker — while their father, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), has no role to play beyond telling Annie to get a grip. Poor Steve and poor Peter, though, who don’t come out of it well. But that’s what happens, one must suppose, if you throw in your lot withcrazy ladies.
It isn’t much of a reveal — it’s one minute of literal exposition right at the end — and it’s not much of a build-up to that reveal, as the pacing is so poor. There are decapitated heads and incinerations and rotting corpses but it’s never dramatic or exciting, and at the viewing I attended the audience laughed at the parts that were intended as the most terrifying, as it’s all so silly. Plus there are plot holes aplenty, as well as psychological ones. Annie wonders why Peter is so stand-offish with her. I don’t know, but might the fact that he once woke up in the middle of the night to find she’d doused him in petrol and was about to set fire to him have something do with it? Might it? One last thing, and I’ll be vague here, to avoid spoiler accusations, but to those who have already seen this: why did the power have to be transferred to a male form? Why wasn’t a girl good enough?
Your better bet is The Happy Prince, Rupert Everett’s passion project about Oscar Wilde’s last, wretched years. No,I didn’t much wish to see Wilde being driven to his death either, but while the film is sad, it is ravishingly sad, and I just love Everett, who’s said so often that his career is over that he’s kind of made a career out of it. Respect.
Everett wrote, directed, produced and stars as Wilde who, at the point that the story is taken up, has just been released from prison for gross indecency. Shunned by British society, he is forced into exile in France and Italy but, even so, he’s cornered in a church one day by a group of Hoorah Henrys out for his blood, and it is so sad, but ravishingly sad, with the light in the church pouring in like melted butter.
Using vignettes and flashback, we learn about his few loyal friends, his relationship with his wife and sons, which was devoted if impossible, and how he allowed Bosie to continue to destroy him. This occasionally slips into cheap sentiment, but there are some stand-out scenes — Wilde singing ‘The Boy I Love Is Up In The Gallery’, for instance — and, of course, there are some terrific lines. ‘I am dying beyond my means,’ he will complain on his deathbed. As for Everett, he is terrific. His Wilde is not hagiographic. His Wilde is brilliant but also foolhardy, exploited but also wilfully self-destructive, funny but also pathetic. A sad film, but ravishingly so.
"
109,DLJ_Doc9_Hereditary,Donjo,Horror,Negative,Hereditary,"The sins of the past are destined to repeat themselves in Hereditary, which is apt considering that the film is the latest heavily hyped Sundance horror hit to fall short of its deafening advanced buzz.
In the grand tradition of Jennifer Kent’s The Babadook and Robert Eggers’ The Witch, writer/director Ari Aster’s debut (in theaters June 8) is a work of malevolent formal precision and mounting-hysterics performances, all of which combine to create an expert atmosphere of dawning dread and, later, supernatural madness. Moreover, as with those prior acclaimed releases, it’s an exercise in style and mood devoid of anything that might significantly raise one’s heart rate, much less serve as legitimate nightmare fuel. Prepare to wait… and wait… and wait some more to be terrified.
To be sure, when it comes to scary movies, everyone’s mileage varies. And as a lifelong horror junkie, I readily confess that my own calloused constitution for the grisly and the macabre is greater than most, sometimes to a fault. Still, no matter that nor the rapturous praise that’s preceded its premiere, Aster’s maiden feature employs meticulous design and lots of screaming to drum up only so-so suspense, convinced that creeping pans through constricting architecture and random suggestions of paranormal activity will put one on edge—or, at least, keep one engaged until the final five minutes, when all hell breaks loose. By the time that mayhem arrives, however, you’ll be forgiven for having lost interest in this patchwork-quilt concoction of ghoulish clichés and Toni Collette freak-outs.
[Spoilers invariably follow]
Collette, it must be said, does her best to keep Hereditary afloat through sheer force of will. Following a prologue obituary for Ellen Taper Leigh, recently deceased at the age of 78, we’re introduced to Ellen’s daughter Annie (Collette), who at the funeral has almost nothing nice to say about her dearly departed mom, a demanding woman fond of secretive “rituals.” While her speech resounds as a giant FORESHADOWING ALERT, Annie’s ensuing behavior is unhinged enough to muddy any initial guesses about where the material is headed.
Annie is on cordial (if detached) terms with her husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) and teenage son Peter (Alex Wolff), and she’s protective of her 13-year-old daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro), whose facial features and socially awkward behavior suggest something is amiss. Strangely unmoved by her mother’s departure, Annie responds by burying herself in her work, which involves constructing miniature dioramas based on scenes from her life—an indication that she can’t let go of her ancestral history.
As it turns out, there’s good reason for that. Hereditary soon exposes all sorts of ugly truths about this seemingly stable domestic unit, including the fact that Ellen used to breastfeed Charlie, and that Annie, a habitual sleepwalker, once woke up to discover that she had covered herself and her kids in paint thinner, a lit match in hand. Not that the clan’s current circumstances aren’t also screwy, what with Charlie cutting off a dead bird’s head with scissors at her school and, later, experiencing visions of her beloved granny in a field near their remote home, lines of flame at her sides. It’s enough to drive a mom batty, which is precisely what happens to Annie, who when not discovering weird books about spirituality in her mom’s belongings, is befriending an eerily cheery woman named Joan (Ann Dowd) at the bereavement group she reluctantly attends to get her mom-related grief off her chest.
Things begin to fall apart after Peter is forced to take Charlie with him to a party where he hopes to score with a girl whose ass he stares at during class. Thanks to some imprudent bites of chocolate cake, food allergy-stricken Charlie requires immediate medical attention, and in a race to get her to the hospital, a tragedy occurs. Unfortunately, such parallels do little to create tension, in large part because Aster’s scripting often feels less intriguingly oblique than outright scattershot, and full of semi-related, thinly drawn plot threads. The more this family begins to spiral out of control, the more the film seems, narratively speaking, as if it’s been assembled not with the painstaking care that Annie shows her tiny models, but with the clumsier craftsmanship Charlie exhibits in making her twigs-and-branches-and-cloth dolls (themselves one of many tossed-off details).
Despite such murkiness, Collette is consistently riveting as a frazzled woman coming apart at the seams, and Wolff handles his own disintegration admirably. Aster, meanwhile, creates moderate foreboding by framing his action in hallways and doorways, and through circular pans around characters that are designed to amplify anticipation for forthcoming surprises. Colin Stetson’s score is also reasonably unsettling, notwithstanding the familiarity of its synthesis of sharp strings, deep bass, and squishy/squelchy/clicking sound effects. Even at its least frightening, the film is, from a technical standpoint, assured enough to deceive one into thinking that greatness—or, at least, a decent jolt—may be lurking around the corner, ready to emerge and break up the monotony.
Indulging in séances, candle-lit ceremonies, fake-out dreams, spooky sketches, and surging spirit-lights, Hereditary charts a conventional descent into wicked terrain, all of it embellished with the (mostly dull, and then silly) clucking noise that Charlie makes with her tongue. What it doesn’t do, however, is develop into something memorably unnerving, or thematically coherent. Aster touches upon issues of grief, resentment, fury, motherly domination, and the potential corrosiveness of legacies. Yet the longer his tale lurches about from one repetitive scenario to another—be it Peter losing it in a classroom, or Annie losing it in her workshop, or Steve losing it with Annie—the more one gets the sense that this Conjuring-esque grab bag of unholy incidents is feigning concern for those issues, while only truly caring about building toward a big climactic reveal.
That Hereditary does, in a finale that seeks to provide a framework (and explanation) for the preceding bedlam. Alas, it’s a too-little-too-late gesture, rendering the film a case study in both the perils of delayed gratification, and of prizing ominous aesthetics above genuine scares. Let’s hope its own progeny don’t follow in its footsteps.

110,DLJ_Doc10_Hereditary,Donjo,Horror,Negative,Hereditary,"Your enjoyment of “Hereditary” may depend on how many horror movies you’ve seen. If you haven’t seen a lot, most of it will shock the ever-loving bejesus out of you. If you have seen quite a few, you might get a kick out of counting all the bits that you’ve seen in other films from the genre. Or, if you’re a big horror movie fan, you might be confounded or even angry at those derivative bits being tossed in, along with one too many other ideas that end up seriously marring the last act. The film falls just short of greatness due to its wildly overplayed finale.
The shame of it is that “Hereditary” is quite terrific before it unravels. Assuredly written and directed by Ari Aster, the film is filled with dread rather than a high body count. The film’s production values are exemplary, particularly the deliberate camera work and subtle sound design. And it contains an intensely committed and affecting performance by lead Toni Collette, not to mention able support by her fellow cast members Gabriel Byrne, Alex Wolff, Ann Dowd and Milly Shapiro. 

Aster starts things off with an unsettling image that sets the tone for most of what’s to come. The camera slowly moves in on an elaborate and detailed dollhouse. It’s clearly hand-crafted art, and as we get closer, it focuses on one of the bedrooms. Then, quite eerily, the room seamlessly becomes real, with a teen boy waking from his bed. Is this a dream, a metaphor, or the film telling us that the line is going to be very thin between fantasy and reality? Yes, yes, and yes. And the movie only gets better from there.
We’re introduced to the occupants of the house, starting with dad Steve (Byrne). He’s a calm and stoic sort, gently nudging the self-absorbed teen boy Peter (Wolff) to get his clothes on for his grandma’s funeral. Younger sister Charlie (Shapiro) isn’t ready for the trip to church either. She’s an eccentric 13-year-old, sullen and morose. Then there is mother Annie (Colette), a woman so high-strung that she’s already sitting in the car ready to go to the church before her children have even awoken. 
At the funeral, this family’s dysfunction is exposed even more. Annie confesses to barely knowing the woman she’s eulogizing, and the bitter daughter indicates that she hasn’t forgiven her mother for the many years of estrangement. The mercurial mother kept many secrets from her daughter too, and Annie confesses to not knowing any of her mom’s friends who show up to mourn.
The more and more time we spend with the Grahams, the more we realize just how utterly secretive and strange they all are. Annie is always on edge, sleepwalking, and displaying wild mood swings day and night. Steve seems inert, even cowardly, in his abilities to calm her or control the wildly undisciplined household. Peter keeps to himself to a fault and lies about his affinity for drugs. And Charlie? Well, she’s the oddest of all. The girl chooses to remain aloof from all, locked in her own private world where she can talk to herself, make irritating noises with her tongue, and scribble ghastly portraits in her sketchbook. She has no friends and is the type of oddball who enjoys decapitating a dead bird and toting it around in her backpack.
Meanwhile, Annie’s fraught history with her deceased mom continues to stick in her craw to the point that she thinks she’s haunting her. It doesn’t help that the miniatures she makes are all of the oddest moments of her weird family life, including unseemly ones with her mother. Her mother exposing a breast to feed one of Annie’s babies, or the family watching Grandma wither away in the hospice are just two of the tableaus Annie has made for her upcoming gallery show. Charlie seems to have inherited a similar creepiness as she makes her own sinister sculpture art out of wires, wood, and that beheaded bird. The young girl also has visions of Grandma too. Indeed, the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree in this family.

Then, a major character is beheaded in an automobile accident, and it throws the family into utter turmoil. Resentments build, relationships fray, and Annie turns towards spiritualism to help her grieve. She meets Joan (Ann Dowd, at her most unctuous) at a grief counseling session and is talked into performing a séance to contact her dead family member. Later, when Annie cajoles her family to join in yet another seance in the middle of the night, the film reaches its zenith of freakiness and unsettling terror. 
But then, as the third act kicks in, the story starts to wobble. The narrative becomes a lot more silly than scary, players zig and zag out of character, and bits are borrowed from other famous frighteners. Aster throws in tropes from “Rosemary’s Baby”, “The Fury”, “Firestarter”, “The Wicker Man”, “The Omen”, “A Nightmare on Elm Street” and “The Shining”, and the uniqueness of the film turns too derivative. It almost plays like fanboy homage rather than a cogent climax.
Did Aster doubt his script’s strengths and decide to give his final act a balls-to-the-wall finish to seem bigger and more commercial? Perhaps so, but that miscalculation robs what had been a unique effort up until the end. Seeing everything but the kitchen sink tossed into the ending while turning the Annie character into some sort of Freddy Kruger/Mrs. Baylock/Jack Torrance hybrid is not only disheartening, but it’s almost laughable.

Perhaps the hereditary in the title actually refers to all that Aster derived from those other movies for his third act, but he should have trusted his subtler instincts. His film could have been a modern classic, something on par with “Get Out” and “It Follows”, a shrewd and intellectual exercise in horror, but it falters at the finish line. Not only are the last 20 minutes desperate undisciplined, but the actions are screen don’t tingle the spine. They will cause you to scratch your head."
111,CYC_Doc1_SpiderMan3,CYC,Comedy,Positive,Spider Man 3,"In the final chapter of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) has finally reached a fulfilling equilibrium between his normal life and his crime-fighting one as he readies a proposal to childhood sweetheart Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). But such serenity is not meant to last, as the masked hero is attacked by foes both old and new. Parker's best friend Harry (James Franco) has again risen to avenge his father; a man made of sand terrorizes New York; and a gooey, symbiotic life-form threatens to destroy the web-slinger entirely. With plenty of fantastical action, a heart-wrenching storyline complete with love and revenge, the funniest Bruce Campbell cameo yet, and a special-effects-laden showdown , the magnitude of which hasn't been witnessed before , ""Spider-Man 3"" hits all the hallmarks of the lucrative series. ""Spider-Man 3"" is, undeniably, an entertaining film. But Sam Raimi, perhaps pressured by the fan base or studio executives, has tried to cram too much into this third , and presumably last , chapter of this hugely popular property. One of Spider-Man's best designed and admired comic book villains, Venom, makes his big screen debut, but it feels awfully small. Focusing mainly on New Goblin and the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), Venom (Topher Grace) is left to relish in only the last half of the film. Plus, his design is greatly lacking from the enormously muscular and grotesque look of the comics; his oversized, teeth-laden mouth and flicking snake-like tongue are drastically toned down , equipped instead with a high-pitched shriek. While Topher Grace's acting is adequate, his scrawny stature just doesn't seem to fit with how Venom has been drawn for so many years. And the character development for this role is greatly stunted; by the time Eddie Brock becomes Venom, audiences will feel mostly indifferent about his trivial motives against Spidey. On the bright side, Sandman is an astonishing villain to behold, with his human side approached with much more care and detailing. Church portrays Flint Marko with a tender demeanor and an honesty that will make viewers believe he's merely a victim of circumstance. The premise that leads to Marko becoming a powerful manipulator of sand is a bit hokey, but nonetheless relatively accurate to his comic book origins. Spider-Man even goes so far as to comment, ""Where do these guys come from?"" But the special effects are flat-out jaw-dropping. The realistic particle effects and manipulation of dirt and mud forming into Church's chiseled visage are simply magnificent. Toward the conclusion, when Sandman becomes a giant monstrosity of earth and cement, his roar of utter awesomeness certainly echoes his appearance. ""Spider-Man 3"" does contain the most involved and complex love story of the three, serving as a suitable culmination of all the loose ends and various plotlines continuing from the previous two ventures. The story arc of Harry Osborn and his demented alter ego finally concludes, with Spider-Man still struggling to mend their fragile friendship. A long-awaited marriage is on the horizon, but jealousy and misunderstandings constantly impede the union, while the appearance of Gwen Stacy (the very blonde Bryce Dallas Howard) further complicates a murky love affair. Raimi divides the suspense in a few key spots with some truly inspired and outrageous dance numbers , a concept that doesn't sound like it would belong in this picture. Tobey in particular throws around a few riotously funny moves after Venom's poison takes effect, giving him a cocky self-confidence and the desire to appear a bit ""emo."" These bits of humor sharply supplement the tone, while also helping to ease the breakneck pacing of the action. With near perfect special effects, interesting new characters, and an intricate narrative that converges and concludes every open-ended development from its predecessors, ""Spider-Man 3"" is both a fitting finale and a colossal blockbuster that no Spidey fan should miss. Again shattering the myth that sequels can't be as good as the original, this closing chapter in the Spider-Man trilogy sends off the flexible superhero with an adventure befitting the expectations his legions of loyal fans demand."
112,CYC_Doc2_SpiderMan3,CYC,Comedy,Positive,Spider Man 3,"It is nigh unto objectively true that Spider-Man 3 is not nearly as good as Spider-Man or Spider-Man 2, but that is not quite mean that it is in fact bad. It's a good comic book movie that suffers only because everyone expected (reasonably) that it was going to be a masterpiece. There are, I think, two separate but parallel flaws. The first is one of tone: this by far the darkest story that Sam Raimi and company have essayed in the three films, concerning Peter Parker's growing obsession with his own legend, literalised in his encounter with an alien symbiote that turns him into a swaggering and violent show-off, emotionally and ultimately physically abusive to those close to him. On paper, this is a perfectly reasonable extension of the concerns covered in the first two films: in each film, Peter is a bit more of an adult, and in each film he has a harder time clinging to the idealism that drove him. It was easy to be a superhero adolescent, but being a superhero adult is something of a bitch. It's not at all clear, unfortunately, that Raimi is anxious to follow his hero. His sensibilities in the previous films was very 1960s, befitting the character's origins; and the director brought a sense of playfulness to the goings-on that kept the films light and exciting even as they followed some very precarious psychological turns. There's not an obvious shift in directorial emphasis in the new film, but somehow it feels more campy; perhaps because the drama is more dramatic, the comic bits seem more out of place. And the dramatic bits, in turn, feel flat and tossed-off. The second flaw is Tobey Maguire. Like Raimi, I think that he has not perhaps grown-up with the character. Indeed, this was my chief complaint about Spider-Man 2, and (notwithstanding my propensity to joke about replacing my beloved Willem Dafoe with Alfred Molina) the primary reason that I think the second film didn't quite work as well as the first. Maguire seems too attached to the character's gee-whiz naivete; although who truly can know what goes on inside the head of an movie star? I cannot explain why Maguire does what he does, I can only argue that what was a distraction in the second film turns into an outright liability here, where we're supposed to believe in Peter's edge and new found assholitude. Instead, he feels like an overgrown kid playing at being a grown-up jerk. It's funny at times - particularly when the symbiote-afflicted Peter walks down the streets doing that finger gun thing at every female he passes by - but the mere fact that it's funny means it's rather aggressively at odds with a mostly violent and bleak storyline. Despite all of this, I enjoyed my time well enough, certainly more than I recall enjoying any of last year's big movies. Let us not forget, the last twelve months have borne witness to X-Men: The Last Stand, Superman Returns and Ghost Rider, a trio of films that were respectively dull, mirthless and insulting. Spider-Man 3 doesn't, perhaps have such a high bar to clear, but it clears it. There are two perfectly fine action setpieces (the sequence that occurs near the beginning of the film is possibly the best-looking and most exciting bit in the whole trilogy). Moreover, while the film is dangerously silly, it's silly in a very recognizably Sam Raimi sort of way; and while that does not mean ""this is a great superhero movie,"" it shouldn't necessarily impugn any of the fun that's to be had. Raimi's films are possessed of a very particular kind of gonzo energy that is appealing all on its own. For starters, Bruce Campbell naturally cameos yet again, and its his best role in the series thus far, given the standards to which we hold Bruce Campbell roles. I also had a whole lot of fun - and this is where I will part ways with just about every sensible critic in North America - with the forthright absurdity present in the film's three musical numbers, and yes you did read that correctly: the film more or less opens with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) performing a '40s-style Broadway number, and there are two dance scenes set in a kitchen and in a jazz club, respectively. None of these (particularly the latter dance number) add anything of remote narrative value to this 140 minute beast, yet they are without question my favorite parts, the parts where Raimi seemed to communicate directly with me. Not because they speak to any sort of attachment I have to the material, but because I really want to think that if I were handed $250 million dollars to make a superhero movie, I'd make damn sure it had a few '40s-style musical numbers. You know, just for the hell of it. Back in the real world, it's worth noting that most of the cast outside Maguire does a pretty fine job: Dunst still doesn't have much to do, but new villains Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) and Eddie Brock/Venom (Topher Grace) are well-played even if they are not brilliantly written, nor do either of them have remotely enough screen time to register as characters, nor do you ever forget that Raimi didn't want to include Venom at all until Sony pushed the character on him. So yeah, the film drops the ball on characters, and the plot is a bit thin, but history is littered with middling-to-awful third films.* Spider-Man 3 is neither middling nor awful. It's disappointing, but still better than any major summer release since Batman Begins in June 2005. It ends the trilogy not with a bang but neither with a whimper (and rumours of Spider-Man 4 notwithstanding, this is a pretty clear closure-granting type of story). I liked it. I wanted to love it. I must, however, confess that I am not just disappointed but actively pissed that the film was shot in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio and not in a 1.85:1 ratio. I'm not joking, either - it really annoyed me throughout the film. I'm no huge fan of 'scope, and I like it when major tentpole releases have the balls to go narrow. This is not the sort of thing that normal critics or viewers give one half of a tinker's damn about, but that is the effervescent magic that is me."
113,CYC_Doc3_SpiderMan3,CYC,Comedy,Positive,Spider Man 3,"We'll get the comparisons out of the way right off the bat. It's better than ""Spider-Man."" It's not as good as ""Spider-Man 2."" With that taken care of, what about ""Spider-Man 3"" itself? It begins shortly after the previous installment ended: Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a successful science student and Spider-Man is the darling of the city, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is a successful actress embarking on her latest role, and long time friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) is trying to figure out his next move now that he's learned Peter is actually Spider-Man, who he blames for killing his father. After two films, director Sam Raimi and his cohorts have gotten their act down pat; no other comic book film series has so completely captured the spirit of its antecedent. The opening action sequence between Spider-Man and the New Goblin is as good as anything in any of the films and feels like exactly what a moving Spider-Man sequence should look like. On top of the expected action sequences, Raimi and co-writers Ivan Raimi (""Army of Darkness"") and Alvin Sargent have crafted an emotionally dense film,for a summer adventure film anyway,following the latest step in Peter's journey into adulthood as he begins dealing with the more ambiguous and complex problems that come with adulthood, in particular his relationship with Mary Jane. The luster of new love has worn off and they're starting to discover that relationships are hard work, and it just keeps getting harder as Mary Jane's career starts to spiral downward while Peter's seems to just keep getting better and better, despite the appearance of rival photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) trying to take his job. Of course, into every life a little rain must fall. This being a comic book film, that rain becomes some sand and black alien gunk from outer space. Raimi's background in B-movie horror really comes to the fore when the alien symbiote shows up, from its arrival like something out of ""The Blob"" or the spores from ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" to the way it takes on its final form as Venom, Raimi makes a difficult character work the only way it really could. At its heart, ""Spider-Man 3"" is a movie of opposites. Each of the main characters must face their own doppelganger that's trying to take over their lives, Peter with Venom, Mary Jane with model/science student Gwen Stacy, and Harry (most interestingly) with himself. Since the movie is called ""Spider-Man"" it's no surprise that most of the emphasis is put on Peter and Venom. Venom symbolizes the darkness and aggression that lies inside of Peter, which begins to come to the surface when he learns perennial criminal Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church), the true murderer of his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), has escaped and is loose in the city evading justice for the crimes he has committed. When the black goo attaches itself to Peter it at first seems like a great gift augmenting his power to the level that he can defeat any opponent, but at the cost of his soul. The human half of Venom photographer Eddie Brock is a smug, deceitful version of Peter Parker and as Peter gives in more and more to the symbiote he becomes more and more like Eddie, eventually literally taking his place, and in the process losing everything important to him. It's all really good stuff, generally well conceived and executed. But it's muddled. Despite what they bring to the film visually and thematically, three villains is two too many, even in a 2 1?2 hour film. Raimi has always had a great deal of empathy for his monsters, and ""Spider-Man 3"" is no exception. The Sandman in particular is a great recipient of this. His introduction is terrific, and Raimi does what he can to build a character-based motivation for Sandman, making him more than just a doer of evil, just a man in some tough circumstances who has made some bad choices. Unfortunately, it doesn't all work. In order to build a connection between Marko and Peter, Raimi and his co-writers have retconned his uncle's death which, while it works perfectly well within the confines of the film, completely removes Peter's motivation for doing what he does. He became Spider-Man because he made a bad choice once and it cost him, and in a film about the importance of personal choices the defining choice of the main character's life is rendered moot. An argument could be made, I suppose, that the director's responsibility is to each film individually and making it work on its own merits, but it's really not that well conceived. Of all the villains, Harry by far is both the most developed and best executed. For the first time James Franco is really given something to do and he does very well with it. Most of that is just nitpicking. It's hard to complain of having too much going on, and the film is certainly extremely well crafted, but it's too ambitious and never quite meets its goals. It's a very melancholy and complex summer blockbuster, and that is undoubtedly a good thing, but with a little streamlining it could have been genuinely great. ""Spider-Man 3"" is a worthy addition to an excellent series, even if it doesn't quite live up to expectations."
114,CYC_Doc4_SpiderMan3,CYC,Comedy,Positive,Spider Man 3,"You're going to see it anyway. What I want to call your attention to in Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man 3"" are Kirsten Dunst's canine teeth. They're prominent and just a wee bit snaggly whenever she smiles in radiant close-up. And they symbolize everything you need to know about why this series has been the most welcome and aesthetically viable of all the big recent Super Hero fantasies. Please understand: Dunst is a breathtakingly lovely young woman (she turned 25 on the movie's recent screening day in Manhattan). But she is captivatingly beautiful in a real way that one might actually encounter in life, not in that distanced, unreal Jessica Biel way that comes with a smile that might well be the product of six-figure Hollywood orthodontia. She's beautiful in the way M.J. -- the former Girl Next Door to Peter Parker in his Queens neighborhood -- might plausibly have been. What was the genius of director Sam Raimi and Co. right from the beginning was that they didn't cast Spider-Man and his girlfriend, they cast Peter Parker and M.J., two troubled, unhappy teens in Queens who had the ambiguous luck to be in love -- not in that sexually supercharged way of Hollywood fantasy but in the forlorn soul-hungry way teenagers often are. And now, two films and some fictional years later, they still are. They didn't cast some handsome, giant-thighed bulging bicep gym rat to be Spider-Man, a triumph of abs and glutes and heavy exercise machinery, they cast a weak-voiced, somewhat nerdly actor to be Peter Parker, a shy, dweeby, tormented fellow who can, by accident, leap off tall buildings and do glorious jungle swings from skyscrapers that seem to cover five city blocks in one mighty swoop. That's why these Spider-Man movies are so good, every one of them. The new one cost somewhere between $250 million and $300 million, depending on whom you believe, and I'm absolutely not going to get into the game of saying it's the best of the series or the worst or any of that hoo-ha that masquerades as discernment in Fan World obsession. Every one of these ""Spider-Man"" movies has been terrific and the new one is no less so. The last ""Superman"" was a spectacular-looking emo-bore. The last ""Batman"" was one of the most overpraised movies of the past decade, I think. ""The X-Men"" movies are interestingly rife with gay subtext and full of gaudy special effects, but I have yet to care a whit about a single character in any of them. We won't even talk about Ben Affleck as Daredevil unless we can give a small cheer for Jennifer Garner as Electra. But these ""Spider-Man"" movies can get you where you live. Lord knows the special effects are grandiose and magnificent but what propels them across vast urban canyons of potential audience boredom is human reality -- the sweet, sensitive nerdliness of Tobey Maguire as an actor, the ever-so-tiny imperfection in Kirsten Dunst's smile which symbolizes what makes her as believable and endearing a love object as you will ever find in a comic book movie. Sure, you want injustice stopped, cruelty thwarted and evil crushed by derring-do but mostly what you want is for these two kids to get together and look up at the moon on summer nights. In ""Spider-Man 3,"" that is fraught with problems. Truth to be told, the new installment is a wee bit plot heavy for me -- too many characters and switcheroos to pay attention to. Think of it as a bit too much macaroni in the casserole. It's still delicious, it's just that it didn't need all the carbs. It's about 15 minutes too long too, while we're at it. But when it's good, it's spectacular and I don't just mean the stunts and effects, though one of those had me in genuine awe. Thomas Haden Church plays a character in this one named Flint Marko, the escaped murderer of Parker's beloved uncle. In one scene, a typical confluence of weird forces turns him into a wild Marvel Comic monster named Sandman. The CGI scene in which all that sand ever-so-slowly coalesces into giant humanoid form was, I swear, the closest movies have come to Adam's arrival on earth in the Book of Genesis. It's as if we finally have the visual technology in movies to show us the creation of form itself out of chaos (or, in this case, millions of grains of sand.) Scenes like that, by the way, are why I've never pooh-poohed the Special Effects in blockbusters. Some of the ""magic"" really is magical. The other quite remarkable thing about ""Spider-Man 3"" is the amount of dramatic ambiguity that was shot through the whole movie. Everyone in it has a rival of some sort and almost everyone takes a turn at being a jerk or a villain or worse. Even Spider-Man when, at one point, some extraterrestrial black goo mysteriously forces him to start dressing in black and doing nasty things. Before that, the old red and blue swinger has gotten so full of himself that he refers to himself as an ""icon"" and, on Spider-Man appreciation day, re-enacts his upside down kiss with a woman other than Mary Jane (one played by Ron Howard's haunting-looking daughter Bryce Dallas Howard.) No one here is purely good or evil but a little bit of both -- with some melancholy thrown in for Freud's sake. The Dark Side awaits everyone in ""Spider-Man 3"" and it's the making of it. Rivalries are everywhere. James Franco comes back as our boy's old buddy/nemesis and a competitor for M.J.'s affections. Topher Grace is a rival for Parker's photographic gigs at the paper. The black goo turns him into a wicked monster named Venom. Spider-Man has so many rivals he wonders ""where DO these guys come from?"" M.J. sings in this one -- not well enough to keep her Broadway gig but good enough to be a singing waitress in a jazz club (until Peter, under black goo influence, competes with her). The comic relief scenes with J.K. Simmons as Peter's blustering editor are outrageously funny. One final word: so good are Sam Raimi and Co. in these movies that if they try to keep the series going with anyone else directing, I wouldn't blame Maguire and Dunst for taking a flying bye-bye.It's Raimi who figured out how to make these movies truly fly and become what they are -- the traditional dramatic annunciation of Blockbuster Season. "
115,CYC_Doc5_SpiderMan3,CYC,Comedy,Positive,Spider Man 3,"Pushing the acrobatic possibilities of this superhero to its DGI limits, director Sam Raimi presides over another high adventure across the parapets and skyscrapers of Manhattan. As he contends with three muscular supervillains, the emotional side of the tentpole coin is covered by his problems with the girl of his dreams. Non-Marvel Comics readers may find themselves losing interest in the franchise but the fan base will eat it up one more time with endorphin-producing gusto. The first menace for the red-suited one and his alter ego, nerdy Peter Parker, freelance photog for The Bugle, comes from outer space in the form of a shooting star, one that neither he nor girlfriend Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) notice as they watch the real ones in the sky while cozying up on a web-woven hammock one fine night. Obviously, they're coo-cooing too much to be aware of the life-like ooze that's coming toward them from the space rock. It's also because Parker/Spidey is off his guard since things have been so tranquil lately. Mary Jane just sang in a Broadway musical, which has him agog over her talent. Parker, still a simple soul if not a simpleton in worldly matters, acts like a retarded teenager without a concept of physical desire, let alone downright sex. A bad word has never slipped past his lips, let alone a suggestive one. All of which is just fine with the demure Mary Jane. He does, however, harbor thoughts of marriage with his lifelong sweetheart. (Pre-teens who find whole line of subject matter abhorrent will just have to sweat it out). As the pristine couple drives off on his motorcycle, the black mucous-like substance, snaking closer to Parker, just misses making contact by a tire tread. Its spooky presence, however, is destined to become a major force from the dark side (yes, I know it isn't ""Star Wars"" but we're borrowing here). In the meanwhile, we're treated to the derivation of the dread Sandman. Just as Spidey acquired his peculiar gifts from a spider that tranmitted them with a bite, a petty criminal called Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), having just escaped from prison, is eluding police. Captain Stacy (James Cromwell) is pissed. But his men force Marko to fall into an experiment chamber with a floor of sand just as a machine revs up, trapping the man in its power structure and doing the molecular necessaries to turn him into a sand giant who always seems on the verge of tears. The emotions of a villain adds dimension to a character and a movie as a whole, but the resolution of such good and evil complexity is a downer. Where is Doc Ock when we need him? Threading his way through the melodrama of Parker's civilian life is papparazzi Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) whose perpetual smile and air of competitive superiority threaten the mild frelance photographer's meager source of income from The Bugle. Its editor, J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) once again demonsrates his ineptness. While this character is pure stereotype, it must be said that it's mined here for some of the film's best laughs. Laughs, and a somewhat new look at the Parker character, also come when he waltzes down 5th Avenue (or is that Madison?) like a peacock, smug, self-satisfied, the ruler of the roost. But there's nothing to laugh about when it comes to Brock, who will do anything and say anything to replace Parker and, even, crawl his way into a staff position, something Parker never dreamed possible. Brock is a guy who never saw a scruple he couldn't ignore when it comes down his ambitions. Which fits perfectly when he takes on the black mystery cloak and becomes the powerful Venom, with powers equal to or greater than Spidey, himself. Finally, there's old bosom buddy Harry Osborn, with whom Peter and Mary Jane grew up together as a bonded trio. Harry, the outlandishly rich son of Norman Osborn, aka, the Green Goblin, never hid his feelings for Mary Jane but has learned to accept her choice of Peter, if with a residue of jealousy. Ah, but it's not a mere matter of the heart driving Harry, it's the provoking voice from the grave that calls out to him in demand that he take on his father's purpose as Spider-Man's nemesis, providing some of the most bone-breaking superhero-on-supervillain combat sequences. It results in a severe head injury that causes Harry to temporarily lose his near term memory and provide a friendship shelter for Mary Jane when misunderstandings (forced) turn into estrangement with Peter. 
The problem with sequels of major tentpole successes is that they are constrained to conform to the original. the secret of success continuing is to maintain as much of the originating creative team as possible, which is done here. But, even then, evolution of the characters is a mine field most studios and investors don't take chances with. Director Raimi broke that mold a bit in Spider-Man 2 with a greater emotional content in the Parker-Watson romance than in the original and wowed audiences. But in playing it safe here he did the series no favors. ""2"" was better than ""1"" but ""3"" lets you down after the possibilities shown in ""2."" This is also a special-effects intensive undertaking like few others. The whiz-bang action in defiance of gravity can't let up and doesn't. We revel in the soaring swiftness of our modest friend and his demonic enemies, a major part of the budget, as well as screen time. We're uplifted every time Spidey comes to the rescue in a new ballet dreamt up by the CGI team. We're relieved by his capacity to withstand a beating. But, of course, given the costs of such spectacle, an investment of $200,000,000 is a lot to worry about. So... rather than protecting that investment with studious adherence to the safety of political and cultural correctness, the series might do better for itself with a bit more daring in the plotline and in the potential of the villains to rivet us to our seats. Even if it means tearing away from its comic book origins. A movie installment demands more. There are some excellently entertaining concepts here and it's not a bad night out. On balance it's good and is likely to be a contender in this year's blockbuster derby. But it leaves you with the feeling that the allure, the intensity of the excitement, the repeatable satisfactions may be tipping into a downswing. "
116,CYC_Doc6_SpiderMan3,CYC,Comedy,Negative,Spider Man 3,"The Hollywood blockbuster might better be characterized as a marketing rather than as a cultural phenomenon. In an intense media campaign, a deluge of promotional materials is unleashed on the population months in advance of the mega-film's release. Artistry is not entirely irrelevant to the final result--after all, a better-looking and more fluid work may sell more tickets--but a serious critique is generally not in order. Reviewing such films, a template suggests itself: check off 'Bombastic,' 'Facile' and 'Technologically juiced-up.' The basic recipe calls for numbing the mind and artificially exciting the senses. A bit of pulling at the hearts strings often translates into added cash value. There are obvious objective reasons for this state of affairs. Riding on each blockbuster are gigantic sums of money. Any deviation from finely tuned prescriptions could mean financial disaster--the margin for error is very small. A dismal box office year in 2005 so panicked the US film industry that the studios responded by producing a record number of movies in 2006, resulting in an increase in production costs for the first time in three years. The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) noted a jump in costs by 3.4 percent over 2005, with the combined average cost of making and marketing a studio picture logging in at $100.3  million, versus $78.2  million in 2002. ""Rise in production costs may be a result of rivers of private equity flowing into Hollywood over the past year as investors and hedge funds showed up with bushels of money to underwrite studio pictures,"" according to a recent article in Variety. The commentary points out that Hollywood is being obliged to pour more of its money into online advertising and other nontraditional marketing methods. Director Sam Raimi has upped the ante in his latest Spider-Man movie. To a single arch-nemesis in the first film of the franchise, two more have been added in the third: Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) and Venom (Topher Grace). The Goblin, the first of the rogues in the series, has been updated to the New Goblin (James Franco), a late-in-the-game force for good. Piling on more villains, more childish love scenes between Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), more technological wizardry and adding another version of Spider-Man in the tradition of Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde does not make for an exponentially better film. Rather, it competes unsuccessfully with the original, which was a minor cut above the typical 2002 blockbuster. The logic of a Hollywood sequel in 2007 is analogous to the transformation of Thomas Haden Church's Flint Marko--a ""decent"" man who accidentally undergoes a genetic alteration and becomes the Sandman. Like an insatiable market imperative, Sandman is condemned to amass more sand (and evil), reaching monstrous proportions. The process is limitless, subverting his humanity. 
The film's press notes give an idea of the dimensions of the more than $250 million project. Over 1,000 production personnel worked on the film. It took 200 man-hours to create one Spider-Man suit, and filming called for 40 suits. ""That's 8,000 man-hours just to create the Spider-Man suit--not counting Spider-Man's black suit or any other costumes,"" state the production notes. Producer Grant Curtis revealed that ""when we began the pre-production process, the computer programs had not yet been developed which could achieve the look of Sandman and his capabilities that Sam [Raimi] wanted to see.... to animate Sandman the way Sam wanted to, we would have to be able to render billions of particles. In the end, the new software they wrote required ten man-years to code."" These were remarkable achievements toward an unremarkable end. And that is the tragedy of large-scale, commerce-driven cinema."
117,CYC_Doc7_SpiderMan3,CYC,Comedy,Negative,Spider Man 3,"I have this theory that ""Spider-Man 3"" is Sam Raimi's revenge on Sony Pictures. What leads me to that theory? Well, Raimi was likely forced to make the second sequel on a speedy time slot, he was likely bored with making another Spider-Man film on such a hectic schedule, and was forced to include Venom, a character he swore off when he took on  the Spider-Man franchise. What's interesting is that ""Spider-Man 3"" seems to prove many of my points at every turn, and it's painful that I may be right. The movie is practically a musical with Mary Jane now singing, and even dances to ""The Twist"" with Harry! But that's not all, true believers. Characters appear and disappear for no clear reason, characters from the previous films are gone, the writers now decide to back step the goofy romance between Peter and Mary Jane as suddenly the two decide that in such a good place in their life, they want to fight some more, whine some more, and make each other jealous. Aw, hell, I've had it with Spider-Man for a good ten years. How can a guy with amazing powers, and three gorgeous femmes hanging off his cod be so melodramatic and bitchy? And why does Raimi feel that all of Spider-Man's best rogues have to be puppy dogs that have just lost their way? Why can't they just be bad guys? And then there's the baggage with Mary Jane who is transformed into this awfully obnoxious prima donna with a daddy complex who seems to be intent on making Peter's life miserable because she's getting bad reviews for her musical, as we see in an awfully ridiculous scene between the two, and Peter becomes an ambiguously flirtatious presence who seeks to get a rise out of Mary Jane for no explainable reason. The problem with ""Spider-Man 3"" besides feeling forced in almost every respect is that there are so many sub-plots that either are left dangling for the sequel or just feel unresolved. We have the primary characters as well as the new characters and villains introduced not to mention anyone else Raimi will throw at us in the fourth film. There's simply no focus set, and there's not enough focus set down on Peter as we saw in ""Spider-Man 2."" And then there are the vague and utterly dubious moments left for the audience to scratch their heads with. For example, Peter's Spidey senses only work when the movie wants it to; take for example the opening with Green Goblin 2, Sand Man sometimes can transform himself into a humongous sand storm a la ""The Mummy,"" J. Jonah Jameson is more of a character out of ""The Three Stooges"" here than an antagonist of Spider-Man's, and what happened to the folks that discovered Spidey's identity? The real center of the film is Peter's bonding with the symbiote which turns him into a cranky version of Parker. He uses the word ""damn,"" talks back to his elders, parts his hair on the other side, and yes, wears a zoot suit and dances with women in a night club. Saddest though, Venom is completely and utterly mishandled. Not only is Venom used as a secondary character, but the menacing and frightening antithesis to Spider-Man and his power is turned into a pansy of a villain who is easily beaten on, and looks pretty damn shabby; everything about the character is completely dismissed in favor of a monster that looks like a sleeker alien from the ""Alien"" series and is given nauseating dialogue (Eddie Brock: ""I like being bad.""). Raimi's third entry into the Spider-Man canon is helped by some high points. All around the special effects are rather excellent. The sand effects for Sandman are phenomenal and often times pay great homage to the comic character. The symbiote is also a character that's handled with enough finesse to warrant a gasp or two, with its oozy substance  becoming an interesting presence. Topher Grace is entertaining as the cocky and egomaniacal Eddie Brock who is delusional in his ways, and discovers a partner in the alien symbiote suit that turns him into the monster. And there's also Bryce Dallas Howard who is utterly sexy as Gwen Stacy. Howard has always been a common crush of mine, and here she is utterly convincing as a blonde. She's a well cast dazzler, here. This third film is awful, it's sloppy, and it's mishandled in every aspect. For the next sequel I want the Lizard, and probably Werewolf by Night. Beyond that, ""Spider-Man 3"" is pretty bad; granted it's not the worst, but it's a cheesy, melodramatic, and utterly sloppy sequel with an embarrassing script and a cast that looks asleep half the time. Let's hope ""Spider-Man 4"" is a rebound, until then, I'm stern on my theory that this movie was bad on purpose. Prove me right, Raimi. "
118,CYC_Doc8_SpiderMan3,CYC,Comedy,Negative,Spider Man 3,"The great failing of ""Spider-Man 3"" is that it failed to distract me from what a sap Peter Parker is. It lingers so long over the dopey romance between Peter and the long-suffering Mary Jane that I found myself asking the question: Could a whole movie about the relationship between these two twentysomethings be made? And my answer was: No, because today's audiences would never accept a hero so clueless and a heroine so docile. And isn't it a little unusual to propose marriage after sharing only one kiss, and that one in the previous movie, and upside-down? Faithful readers will recall that I found ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004) the best superhero movie since ""Superman"" (1978). But I made the mistake of declaring that was because ""the movie demonstrates what's wrong with a lot of other superhero epics: They focus on the superpowers, and shortchange the humans behind them."" This time, I desperately wanted Peter Parker to be short-changed. If I argued earlier that Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent were boring human beings, I had no idea how Peter would begin to wear on my nerves. And what's with Mary Jane? Here's a beautiful, (somewhat) talented actress good enough to star in a Broadway musical, and she has to put up with being trapped in a taxi suspended 80 stories in the air by alien spider webs. The unique quality of the classic comic books was that their teenagers had ordinary adolescent angst and insecurity. But if you are still dangling in taxicabs at age 20, you're a slow learner. If there is a ""Spider-Man 4"" (and there will be), how about giving Peter and Mary Jane at least the emotional complexity of soap opera characters? If ""Juno"" (opening Dec. 14) met Peter Parker, she'd have him for breakfast. Superhero movies and Bond movies live and die by their villains. Spidey No. 2 had the superb Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), who is right up there with Goldfinger and the Joker in the Supervillain Hall of Infamy. He had a personality. In Spidey No. 3 we have too many villains, too little infamy. Take the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church). As an escaped con and the murderer of Uncle Ben, he has marginal interest at best. As the Sandman, he is absurd. Recall Doc Ock climbing buildings with his fearsome mechanical tentacles and now look at this dust storm. He forms from heaps of sand into a creature that looks like a snowman left standing too late in the season. He can have holes blown into him with handguns, but then somehow regains the bodily integrity to hammer buildings. And how does he feel in there? Molina always let you know precisely how Doc Ock felt, with a vengeance. Then there is the black microorganism from outer space, which is not a villain, but plays one in the movie. It arrives on Earth in a meteorite that lands, oh, maybe 20 yards from Peter and Mary Jane, but this impact somehow escapes notice by the fabled Spidey-sense. Then it produces little black beasties that look like squids crossed with licorice rope. They not only coat people with a way-cool black glossy second skin, but specialize in spray-painting Spidey and Spidey wannabes. No ups, no extras. We know that Spider-Man's powers do not reside in his red suit, which lies in a suitcase under his bed. So how do fake Spideys like Venom gain their powers when they are covered with the black substance? And how does a microorganism from outer space know how to replicate the intricate patternwork of the Spidey costume, right down to the chest decoration? And to what purpose from an evolutionary point of view? And what good luck that the microorganism gets Peter's rival photographer, Eddie Grace, to infect, so that he becomes Venom! And how does Eddie know who he has become? Another villain is Harry Osborn, a k a the New Green Goblin (James Franco), son of the interesting original (Willem Dafoe) but not a drip off the old gob. While the first GG had the usual supervillain motivations (malevolence, envy, twisted abilities) his son is merely very angry and under the misapprehension that Peter/Spidey murdered his old dad. And then Peter and Harry have a fist fight when they should be doing Spidey and Goblin stuff. Yes, there are some nice special effects in the movie. I liked the collapsing construction crane sequence. But the damsel in distress this time was not Mary Jane but Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), the sexy blond lab partner Peter has somehow neglected to mention to Mary Jane, causing her heartbreak because at a civic ceremony he kisses her with our kiss, i.e., the upside-down one. While Peter goes through a period of microorganism infection, he combs his hair forward, struts the streets, attracts admiring glances from every pretty girl on the street, and feels like hot stuff. Wait until he discovers sex. ""Spider-Man 3"" is, in short, a mess. Too many villains, too many pale plot strands, too many romantic misunderstandings, too many conversations, too many street crowds looking high into the air and shouting ""oooh!"" this way, then swiveling and shouting ""aaah!"" that way. And saints deliver us from another dinner date like the one where Peter plans to propose to Mary Jane. You know a movie is in trouble when the climactic romantic scene of the entire series is stolen by the waiter (Bruce Campbell). And poor Aunt May (Rosemary Harris). An actress of Harris' ability, asked to deliver a one-note performance, and that single note is fretting. How could Sam Raimi, having gone so right with ""Spider-Man 2,"" have gone so wrong with ""Spider-Man 3""? Did the $250 million budget paralyze him? Has the series grown too heavy on its feet? How many times can we see essentially the same romantic scenario repeated? How much dangling in the air can one girl do? And how does Spidey keep his identity a secret anyway, when there are more arrivals and departures through his apartment's window than on a busy day at LaGuardia?"
119,CYC_Doc9_SpiderMan3,CYC,Comedy,Negative,Spider Man 3,"You know that the third Spider-Man had to be bigger. The third movie in a franchise goes for broke. And Spider-Man 3 is bigger, if not better. It's overdone, overlong, and overplotted. It's all over the place. This does not mean Spider-Man 3 is a bad movie; it's an entertaining one. But it is fundamentally limited by its size and scope. One of the great assets of the original Spider-Man movie was that Peter Parker was naive and innocent. He was startled and pleased when he was transformed -- he was a kid with super powers. The movie was genuine. The second Spider-Man movie turned big and clunky -- the villain, Doc Ork, was part machine. The movie became part machine; it was a good film, but labored. Now the third Spider-Man movie morphs into competing effects, and characters who won't quit. There are two Spideys, two Harrys, two Flint Markos, and two Edward Brocks. Dualities asunder. They play musical chairs with their characters. He's good; no, he's bad; no, he's good again. It makes your head spin as though it's caught in an addled web -- or just a very fickle script. Spider-Man 3 has three villains for the price of one. And these multiple villains keep coming back to life ad nauseum. The plot is a hodgepodge of revenge and identity confusion. Spidey is now a celebrity, and it seems to have gone to his head. He preens and brags. But writer-director Sam Raimi does very little with this promising theme. His satire is conventional. It is fortunate that Raimi is back directing Spidey for the third time, but Raimi has a dull streak. The opening fifteen minutes of the movie are drab and listless. This is no way to treat Spidey. And Raimi's handling of crowd scenes with mobs of people applauding Spidey and his exploits is painfully one-dimensional. If it weren't for J.K. Simmons, who chews the scenery as the blustery editor of the New York Bugle, there would be little if any comic relief. Spider-Man should have a lilt to it, but that spirit is mostly absent. The cast is serviceable, but it often is smothered by special effects. Welcome to the world of modern movies. Thomas Haden Church and Topher Grace humanize their villains when they aren't ducking special effects. Church eats many pecks of sand. James Franco acts as though he is in some kind of smiling contest as the erratic Harry. Bryce Dallas Howard is winsome as Peter Parker's classmate. Dylan Baker is wasted as Peter's teacher, as is James Cromwell as the police chief. One can assume much of their footage was sacrificed to more special effects, and wound up on the cutting room floor, amidst piles of left-over sand. Kirsten Dunst keeps plugging away as Mary Jane Watson. She's now on Broadway -- for one performance. Then she mopes and pouts. Sometimes -- especially with her character -- it seems as though the director has thrown away some page that had motivation and continuity. Mary Jane changes her mood like a cheap mood ring. The best moments of Spider-Man 3, of course, are the human moments. The affecting climax is emotional. But too much of the movie plays games with the plot. It's special-effects hopscotch, instead of a convincing, coherent puzzle. The best thing about Spider-Man 3 is that it is not Spider-Man 4."
120,CYC_Doc10_SpiderMan3,CYC,Comedy,Negative,Spider Man 3,"Look, here's the deal: If you're likely to break into applause the minute you spot Stan Lee's obligatory cameo, or roll on the floor with laughter as soon as Bruce Campbell walks into the film, or think that life-lesson, bumper-sticker wisdom from Aunt May (Rosemary Parker) is deeply profound, then read no further, because you'll love Spider-Man 3 and only get yourself worked up over the fact that I didn't. No, the film is not exactly horrible, but it comes close, and isn't good, despite its reputed $350  million  dollar  price  tag  and  all  the  hype  an  additional  $150  million  of promotion can buy. I'll admit I wasn't expecting to be blown away by Spider-Man 3. I did give good reviews to Spider-Man (2002) and Spider-Man 2 (2004), but I had reservations about the latter--that it was a structural mess, that it was too full of itself, that it lacked the freshness of the first film etc. (That otherwise reasonable people were calling it ""one of the truly great films"" didn't help. Now, my definition of ""the truly great films"" is pretty broad, but really is Spider-Man 2 likely to be on the same list as Potemkin, Grand Illusion, Citizen Kane and Lawrence of Arabia? A little perspective, please.) Everything that was wrong with or at least creeping in around the edges of Spider-Man 2 is on full display in the third installment--and then some. Spider-Man 3 is such a mess that it's hard to know where to begin. You may have heard that Sam Raimi and company have tried to cram too much into one overlong (140 minutes) movie, and that's true. But that's hardly the beginning or ending of the trouble. The essential problem is that all the stuff crammed into the film ranges from the perfunctory to the not very good to the outright bad. The idea of filling the movie with bad guys was an especially poor one coming from Raimi. This is the man who put together Spider-Man 2 in such a clunky manner that it was easy to forget the supposedly central plot involving Dr. Octopus (Alfred Molina). The movie instead wandered through relationship troubles between Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), Harry Osborn's dead daddy issues and Aunt May's financial woes. Just imagine how Raimi handles three-and-a-half villains in Spider-Man 3--along with all the other side issues which are even more pronounced here. In addition to the aforementioned plot points, we've now got Mary Jane's disastrous show-biz career (affording much unimpressive vocalizing for Kirsten Dunst); a romantic rivalry between Mary Jane and Gwen Stacy (Dallas Bryce Howard); a romantic rivalry between Peter and Harry; a professional rivalry between Peter and new photojournalist-on-the-block Eddie Brock (Topher Grace); a conscience-stricken villain, Flint Marko/Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), with a sick child (Perla Haney Jardine, Kill Bill Vol. 2); Spider-Man's extraterrestrially induced identity crisis that transforms him on occasion into ""bad"" Spidey... There's more, but that's a good sampling of how and why whatever plot there is gets lost in Raimi's plodding structure. And then there are the villains. Although Spider-Man 2 tended to lose sight of Dr. Octopus, he was a villain for the ages. The guys in this film--Harry/New Goblin, Marko/Sandman and Eddie/Venom--aren't even also-rans, nor for that matter is Bad Spidey (who counts as the half villain). It's easy to say that none of them are given enough screen time to make the impression ""Doc Ock"" did. And that's true, but does anyone really want more of Sandman? And three-and-a-half under-developed villains ought to at least equal one well-developed one, but they don't. Of course, the combined acting skills of Maguire, Grace, Church and Franco don't equal those of Alfred Molina either, and that's part of the problem. Beyond this, the writing is pretty bad. The dialogue--even by comic-book standards--is stilted and false. Plot contrivances run riot to a point that the movie's often in the land of ""Ah, we meet again, thanks to clever scripting."" The goo from outer space that creates both Spidey and Venom just happens to land near Spidey, and just happens to attach itself to his moped, and just happens to get into his room, and just happens to latch onto him days and days later when it's convenient to the story. Harry gets amnesia only for purposes of sidelining his villainy for an hour, and very selective amnesia it is: He remembers Peter, Mary Jane, high school, cooking skills and indeed everything except maybe dancing by the on-screen evidence, but nothing about his late super villain father (Willem Dafoe). Harry's butler (John Paxton giving the most monotonous one-note performance in history) is privy to a key bit of information that could have saved a lot of grief, but somehow he never thinks to share it till the next to last reel. Large chunks of the film are just plain goofy. It was bad enough in Spider-Man 2 that an entire subway's worth of passengers knew who Spider-Man was, but now he appears in broad daylight putting on his mask for a publicity event, and romantically lounging with Mary Jane on a giant spiderweb (explain that to a passerby). The idea of Bad Spidey consists of making Peter into a jerk, who at first looks like an incipient Hitler, and then transforms into a Goth creation that resembles Stephen Trask as the back-up singer in Hedwig's glam band in Hedwig and the Angry Inch (2001). The fact that he comes across like someone who saw Saturday Night Fever (1977) one time too many is more dated and pathetic than funny or clever. In its favor it makes a break from Peter's nonstop moping and tearing up. (There's more crying in this movie than in a Bette Davis soap opera.) And what's up with this silly ""particle separator"" that creates Sandman? An open pit anyone can just fall into? The technicians operating it can tell that the mass has changed, but can't tell the difference between ""probably just a bird"" and 200 pounds of overrated actor? Even the unflappable J.K. Simmons--still the best thing in the movie--as newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson is reduced to comedy so broad that the Three Stooges would have rejected it as too unsubtle. The icing on the cake, though, may be the pricey and highly touted effects. Not only is there nothing here you haven't seen before--all the ""neat"" Sandman effects were in Stephen Sommers' The Mummy back in 1999, and the origin of the effect dates back to 1980 and Ken Russell's Altered States--but a lot of it, especially the green screen work, isn't very good, and the CGI is frequently cartoonish (Venom's mouth). Again, if you're presold on the whole thing, you're likely to forgive the film's flaws--or at least try to. If you're not, you'll rarely have been so glad to see the ending credits finally start. Rated PG-13 for sequences of intense action violence."
121,JMI_Doc1_Us,JMI,Horror,Positive,Us,"In 2017, Jordan Peele entered the spotlight as one of Hollywoods great new directors with the release of Get Out, a film that used horror as a backdrop to refract race relations in todays America. Smart modern usage of the genre that catapulted the director to an Academy Award win for Best Original Screenplay. While Get Out is out to send a powerful message, the films finale fails to stick its landing in categorizing it as one of the greats of the 2010s. This opinion stems from the films final 20 minutes.  While the first 80 minutes focus on race relations and strays away from a conventional horror film, its climax turns into a cliché including an uneven turn where brain surgery is the source of the events that have taken place throughout the narrative.
Two years later, Jordan Peele has returned with his sophomore outing, Us, a thought-provoking excursion that is nothing short of a colossal cinematic achievement. Peeles new film is both darker and more ambitious, and broader in its themes and immediately enters the category of a modern day masterpiece. What makes Us so unique is it can bypass the concept of genre and make the audience sit, think, and create a mindset and opinion about what the theme of this film is.
Similarly to classics such as 2001: A Space Odyssey (a sci-fi film), The Godfather Parts 1 and 2 (a crime drama), Us falls under the horror genre but its so much more than that. Like the previously mentioned classics, the film creates conversations and debate among moviegoers as to what Peele is trying to tell us. On the surface, the film is positioned as a home-invasion style horror film. Add in Peeles creative mind and Us rises above its horror genre definition. The films real purpose is to look at the big picture of cultural consciousness and the cultural unconscious. The moral compass that lies in all of us that is quick to create an opinion of someone without knowing all the facts. Us is the self-examination of a human being.
Along with Peeles direction, Winston Duke, Shahadi Wright Joseph, and Evan Alex should be commended for their duel performances. Duke continues to show why he is on the rise as one of Hollywoods consistent actors. From Black Panther to Us, Duke shows no signs of being typecast and will not shy away from accepting new roles which will add to the depth of his repertoire. While Joseph and Alex can differentiate, both parts played in a way where compassion can still be had for both roles each of these child actors took in the film. Did I miss someone? Oh yes, then theres Lupita Nyongos take as Adelaide/Red. A year ago, cinephiles were craving for an Academy Award nomination for the brutally raw performance by Toni Collette in Hereditary.
While the nomination failed to come to fruition, there is a sense that Lupita is on her way to break the horror genre Oscar nomination curse as her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece. Nyongos performance propels the story forward. She extracts and displays emotion from both of her characters with an incredible amount of depth and range. A performance that will make you question whether two people are playing these characters and realizing that she is phenomenal in showcasing their duality. Lupita should not only be considered a shoo-in for a nomination come awards season but it would not shock me if she becomes a two-time Oscar winner.
Michael Abels score aids the film by adding all the necessary tension and anxiety for the audience to experience even going as far as become a central character in the movie. The use of I Got 5 on It is something I never knew I wanted until I got it. Abels use of the track near the films finale is a genius move and something you need to see onscreen for yourself. As a fan of 90s hip-hop, I certainly will never look at this track the same again.
The best way for me to compare this brilliant film is by looking at a modern day musical genius, Kendrick Lamar. When he released his first album, good kid, m.A.A.d city, Lamar provided listeners with an in-depth, in your face look at life in Compton. With his sophomore outing, To Pimp A Butterfly, Lamar chose to take a different route and release a more thought invoking album that created a buzz around Lamars change in direction. A few years have passed, and To Pimp A Butterfly is now viewed as a classic.
Just like that, Us has confirmed that Peele has become a tour de force as a director in Hollywood. His fearlessness in filmmaking has become abundantly clear and hes willing to take the necessary narrative risks in his writing and direction similarly to Alfred Hitchcock. Hes slowly but surely earning his spot to be one of Hollywoods great directors."
122,JMI_Doc2_Us,JMI,Horror,Positive,Us,"Jordan Peeles 2017 debut Get Out was a landmark in African-American storytelling, broke box-office records, and served as a representational wakeup call to the film industry  but it wouldnt have carried so much weight if it werent also such a gratifying viewing experience. His sophomore effort, Us, proves that surprise hit wasnt a fluke. Peeles second outing as writer-director confronts the ridiculously high expectations of its predecessor by pivoting to a broader canvas of ideas about the nations fractured identity. In the process, it gives audiences exactly what they want by delivering what they least expect.
As it turns out, the ultimate zeitgeist movie in 2019 harkens back more than 30 years. Us imports Reagan-era America to a mortifying contemporary context that revisits the past as a nightmare that wont die. In the process, it unfolds as a satisfying dose of relentless, anxiety-inducing survival antics designed to keep viewers perpetually uneasy, and moves so quickly that they can only consider the deeper undercurrents after the credits roll.
The vehicle for all of this is a brilliant home-invasion thriller laced with cultural reference points stretching back to the late 80s, and a smorgasbord of first-rate visceral cinematic scares. Think Funny Games collided with Cronenbergian body horror and Hitchockian suspense, and youre maybe halfway there.
Before Us settles into its grounded first act, opening credits explain there are thousands of abandoned tunnels hiding under the countrys exterior; theres also a fleeting commercial for Hands Across America that revisits that bizarre 1986 national fundraiser, when six million people formed a human chain to raise money for homelessness. The movies ability to forge its sinister premise in this phenomenon inspires the audience to read into every moment, but the relentless pace wont let you catch your breath.
The stunt attracted widespread celebrity approval, with no less than Michael Jackson taking a central role in its publicity. Us opens in the midst of that year, as a young black family explores a beachside carnival, and young Adelaide (Madison Curry) wanders off. It only takes a matter of minutes for Peele to land on the movies first astounding cultural vision, the sight of a disturbed black adolescent wearing an oversized Thriller t-shirt and gazing out at the stormy sea. Later, Adelaide discovers an abandoned hall of mirrors with a shimmering yellow sign beckoning visitors to FIND YOURSELF. She wanders in, and comes face to face with a child who looks exactly like her. Horror buffs may realize that Alexandre Ajas Mirrors touched on similar doppelganger fears, but theyre merely a starting point here.
Us deserves its best surprises to remain unspoiled, but even its first-act setup hardly reveals its final destination. As Peele leaves the storys first abrupt twist unresolved, he cuts to the present-day, when Adelaide has grown to become a nurturing mother (Lupita Nyongo, impressive as always) traveling to a Northern California beach house with her husband Gabe (a cheery Winston Duke) and their young kids Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex). The script takes its time developing the familys more endearing qualities. Jason unleashes his rascally energy as he bounds around the house in a Halloween mask, Gabe cant stop obsessing with his low-rent boat, and Adelaide rolls her eyes. Add a laugh track and this may as well be a sitcom.
But thats temporary. When the family heads to the beach, hanging with their affluent neighbors Kitty (Elisabeth Moss) and Josh (Tim Heidecker), Us seems to be heading toward a class-based variation on Get Out, with a series of cringe-inducing conversations between two very different families. But at nightfall, Adelaide has just enough time to revisit her childhood fears before they literally return to haunt her: Theres a red-clad family unit that looks exactly like hers, standing outside. It doesnt take long for these figures to take charge of the household, forcing the relatives to splinter in various directions as their growling reflections pursue them, brandishing golden scissors and vacant stares. Plenty of blood-spattered showdowns ensue, with ample payoff that keeps moving ahead, but even as this deranged setup takes flight, Us has a grander agenda ahead.
Peele has somehow developed an uncanny ability to explore how past cultural events can take ominous new dimensions in the present: The leitmotif of faceless Americans joining hands in an endless show of empty solidarity is a provocative setup, but Peeles script keep digging into its ramifications. What are you? Adelaide asks her double, and the answer comes in eerily straightforward fashion: Were Americans.
As the family escapes one grisly battle and heads to the next, Peele establishes that the run-for-your-life dynamic serves as only one piece of the larger apocalyptic tapestry he has in store. In the meantime, it presents a range of opportunities for the talented cast to engage in extraordinary dual performances. Nyongo in particular makes for an incredible study in contrasts, giving a frightened monologue about her past trauma at one moment  and, as her monstrous opposite, unleashing cryptic threats in a gravelly whisper.
It was obvious from Get Out that Peele has a knack for indelible imagery, which Us matches with visual sophistication to spare: Reflections, doorways, and high ceilings frame some of the most absorbing moments, which avoid the obvious jump scares (although they make a few appearances). Cinematographer Michael Gioulakis plays with light and shadow to menacing effect, while Michael Abels unnerving score builds to shrieking crescendos, some of which do push this jittery material over the top."
123,JMI_Doc3_Us,JMI,Horror,Positive,Us,"You know youre in the hands of a natural born filmmaker when you can feel yourself being tugged, as if by invisible forces, from one shot to the next, into a movies diabolical design. Thats the sensation provoked by Jordan Peeles Us, which begins with a sequence so expertly shot, cut, and orchestrated that you can only submit to the internal, infernal logic of its construction. On the boardwalk of Santa Cruz circa 1986, illuminated by a carnival glow, a small girl (Madison Curry) strays from her parents side. Shes drawn, by signs and coincidence, to that enduring symbol of fractured identity, the hall of mirrors. What she finds inside is a different kind of movie monster: a reflection made flesh, a phantom spitting image of self. Its the audience, though, thats really being ushered into the funhouse. And by the end of this ominously enthralling prologue, bracketed on one side by a rabbit-ear TV and the other by actual rabbit ears, youre ready to go wherever the movie plans to take you.
Us, as it turns out, doesnt go anywhere quite as clever or daring as Peeles last film, his Oscar-winning transition out of sketch comedy and into the upper echelons of Hollywood. Get Out, remember, grabbed its audience right from the start, too. It was, as they say, a hard act to follow: a slow-burn supernatural thriller that was really a damning satire about the way racism survives and thrives, even in the coziest of liberal enclaves. While hardly devoid of ideas (whether telling jokes or staging scares, Peele remains an incisive social critic), Us operates in a less directly subversive mode. And yet if Peele is taking his victory lap in the genre sandboxhaving a grand time, not making a grand statementits with enough panache to continue outpacing the competition. Hes made a primo popcorn slasher: fun, funny, elegant even when aiming for the jump-scare reflexes of the same multiplex crowd that gobbled up Get Out.
The little girl in the opening scene grows up to be Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyongo), successful in her professional life and content in her personal one, but still haunted, if only distantly, by memories of that face-to-identical-face encounter at the fair. Leaping ahead to the present day, the film picks up with her on a summer getaway, traveling with her burly goofball husband, Gabe (Nyongos Black Panther costar Winston Duke, hilariously nailing the dad-joke energy), and their two children, teenage daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and preteen son Jason (Evan Alex), to a cabin on the California coast. The weather is lovely, but Adelaide cant shake a bad feeling provoked by some odd omens. And in much faster fashion than Get Out, Peele confirms his heroines worst fears with the sudden arrival of the bizarro Wilsons: hostile doppelgängers of each family member, dressed in blood-red and brandishing gold scissors.
These clone intruders, played by the same actors as their counterparts, are nonverbal, with the exception of Adelaides childhood double, all grown-up too and speaking in a ghostly rasp. Were Americans, she hisses when her terrified other self asks who or what they are. Couple that line with an alternative reading of the title in all-caps, and it becomes clear that Peele is reaching for some point about the national characterthe ugly truth about who we are as a country, buried deep below like the squirming insects at the beginning of David Lynchs Blue Velvet. Its a good time for a little collective, cultural self-reflection. But the metaphor doesnt entirely track. Do these evil twins represent our darkest impulses, our forgotten past selves, or some vague combination of the two
Such scrutiny does Us few favors. Its better appreciated on a visceral level, as an inventive, often virtuosic spin on home-invasion horror. Working with cinematographer Mike Gioulakis, who made the frame itself a source of terror in the brilliant It Follows, Peele offers up one effective suspense set piece after anotherexploiting foreground and background space, locking us into the tunnel vision of the characters, tracking enemy movements around the perimeter of the house in gliding long takes. He even makes the hoarier horror tricks sing anew: By the time a massacre occurs to the timeless strains of Good Vibrations, youll wonder if hes auditioning to direct the next Strangers sequel. Though maybe Scream is the better point of comparison: The balance of tones, the teetering between laughs and scares, would make Wes Craven proud. Peele, though, conducts the mayhem to his own malevolent orchestra, even if Uslike Get Out before itis more giddily entertaining than it ever is scary.
This is a directors and an actors film, ultimatelyit gets expressive work out of its entire cast, most doing literal double duty. (Outside the nuclear unit at center, Elisabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker, as another couple in the area, make a volatile impression, too.) But Peele counts most on Nyongo, on her tour de force yin-yang routine, to sell the half-digested themes of dueling dualities. The film eventually gets around to taking its nightmare premise from the irrational to the concrete, providing an explanation that seems less than necessary, on top of not making a whole lot of sense. But theres an emotional logic, at least, to its climactic shadowboxingone provided by both Nyongo and the director spectacularly orchestrating her dance of diametric opposition. Us proves, if nothing else, that Peele has become a blockbuster visionary, fully in control of his craft. Its a privilege to step back into the funhouse of his imagination."
124,JMI_Doc4_Us,JMI,Horror,Positive,Us,"I know: That was writer-director-producer extraordinaire Jordan Peeles LAST insta-classic horror film. This one is called Us  but time and again, you want to yell GET OUT! to the vacationing family who find themselves stalked by a quartet of scissors-wielding doppelgangers who are hell-bent on killing them.
Get out of the house. Get out of the car. Get out of the boat. Get out of the 
Well. You get the idea. But Us is many cuts (so to speak) above the standard slasher/stalker thriller, so every time someone goes back into the house, or walks toward the danger, or dares to take the escalator down, down, down  it actually makes sense.
This family isnt stupid. Theyre all whip-smart. But theyre fiercely determined to protect one another, even if it means killing people who look exactly like they do.
Talk about a Freudian Trip.
Certain elements of Us carry echoes of the works of Hitchcock and Kubrick, Spielberg and John Carpenter and George Romero, among others  but the immensely talented Peele also has a voice of his own. Even as one laps up the richly textured, fantastically bizarre pleasures of Us, one is already eagerly anticipating the next work, and the next, and the next.
Directed with feverish style, beautifully paced, filled with wickedly funny one-liners and sight gags, brimming with bloody good battles and featuring insanely entertaining dual performances from the principal cast (led by nomination-worthy work from Lupita Nyongo), this is a disturbingly creepy gem.
What are you? says a key character in the story.
Were Americans, comes the response.
Ill not say which line is spoken by the villain, and which belongs to the good guy. Its just one of the many times when Us offers sly commentary on the American Dream  and the distorted, funhouse-mirror image of that dream, which is anything but fun. (After all, the movie is called Us, as in us as a family unit, but also of course US as in USA.)
Did I get every single plot element, every oddball visual touch, every little piece of the puzzle, even after one key character offers a helpful tutorial deep into the story?
Perhaps not. OK, OK  DEFINITELY not. But isnt that the case with almost all the great horror films, from The Shining to Hereditary? Theres something thrilling about exiting a film and instantly wanting to see it again  not to mention anticipating having passionate discussions with others once theyve seen it.
After a stunningly effective prologue set at a beachfront carnival in 1986 that glues us to our seats, we land in present day, with the Wilsons driving to Santa Cruz for a family vacation.
Lupita Nyongo is Adelaide, an overprotective mom who is trying her best to relax and get in the spirit of the trip. Winston Duke is her husband, the amiable Gabe, a classic American father whose enthusiasm for the vacation and dad jokes have the kids rolling their eyes. Shahadi Wright Joseph is their teenage daughter Zora, who of course is always wearing ear buds and tethered to her phone. Evan Alex is young Jason, who appears to be on some kind of spectrum and often hides behind a Halloween mask.
One night, a family appears in the driveway.
A family thats a mirror image of the Wilsons  only theyre all wearing red jumpsuits, and theres pure madness in their expressions, and theyve got murder on the menu.
Are they zombies? Replicants? Aliens?
Something else?
Adelaides doppelganger (called Red) speaks in a croaky voice that will chill you to the spine. Zoras evil mirror image, Umbrae, has a sicko smile plastered on her face. Gabes evil twin, Abraham, has the guttural roar and plodding menace of Frankensteins monster. And little Jasons opposite, Pluto (who has a mask of his own,) skitters about on all fours.
Peele and his cinematographer Mike Gioulakis serve up a feast of arresting visuals, whether were tracking along with a family member who is being chased (or is on the chase) in dark corridors or deep down a rabbit hole, or outside in the bright of day, when the horror doesnt take a break just because the sun is out. And the music from Michael Abels, including a recurring theme reminiscent of The Omen, is the perfect tour guide for this mad journey.
This is an unforgettable dance with the devil."
125,JMI_Doc5_Us,JMI,Horror,Positive,Us,"There's so much to admire about Us, Jordan Peele's muscular follow-up to Get Out, that it's worth appreciating what Peele does when the ebb-and-flow of horror tension reaches low tide. Many of the most celebrated horror maestros are hailed for their big, atmospheric set-pieces, but getting to those moments can often feel like crude narrative patchwork, the listless verses before a killer chorus. Peele excels in these obligatory sections, where his skills as a sketch comedy writer and pop-culture savant can liven up conversations that we've been conditioned to expect as the yadda-yadda bridging to nightfall, when a film can finally uncork some suspense and mayhem.
There's mayhem aplenty to be uncorked in Us, which is as conceptually messy as Get Out was ruthlessly self-contained, but Peele's quick evolution into a full-service entertainer dispels any fears of a sophomore slump. He can deftly mix-and-match ideas cherry-picked from past classics  the echoing childhood trauma of Don't Look Now, the alien doppelgängers of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, the masked home-invasion of The Strangers  but he can also handle the banalities of a family car trip to the beach or underscore a gruesome sequence with the theremin whistle of the Beach Boys' ""Good Vibrations."" He's actively engaged at every moment, which is especially helpful when the film's bold abstractions start to wriggle away from it a little.
Where Get Out turned a Stepford Wives premise into a bitterly satirical allegory for what it's like to be black in America, Us opens up to a broader, vaguer, more suggestive diagnosis of social ills, packaged as a metaphysical shocker where the characters are attacked by versions of themselves. Starting with a flashback in 1986, the film opens with young Adelaide Wilson wandering off from a Santa Cruz boardwalk one stormy summer night and entering a hall of mirrors, where she encounters a child that's her exact reflectionbut not. (Think of the famed mirror sequence with Groucho and Harpo Marx in Duck Soup, only utterly bone-chilling.)
Now a grown-up with a husband (Winston Duke) and two children (Evan Alex and Shahadi Wright Joseph) of her own, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) vacations to a secluded home near Santa Cruz and immediately seizes up with panic, as memories of this past trauma bleed insidiously into the present. Seemingly innocuous visual cues land with such a devastating impact that Adelaide pleads with her husband to split town even before a more tangible threat arrives. But as they're preparing to leave, another family of four arrives on their driveway, dressed in matching red jumpsuits. They also happen to look exactly like they do, making them literally their own worst enemy.
There's an explanation for this curious phenomenon  a big one, in fact, connected to a network of tunnels cited in the opening titles  but Peele is asking America herself (the Us or U.S. of the title) to look itself in the mirror and consider the destinies of those invisible millions who share our country, but not always our good fortune. The deeper the film goes into accounting for what's really happening, the less it holds up under scrutiny, both in the logistics of the doppelgängers' existence and in the abstract themes Peele appears to be exploring. That's not as damaging to the film as it sounds, but Us plays better as an intuitive experience than a puzzle box where every question has an answer. Peele would rather tease the imagination than tidy things up.
In that respect, Us is a leap forward for Peele as a director, because so much of what he's trying to express doesn't make sense on the page, as Get Out did. In a stunning dual performance as Adelaide and her gravel-voiced other, Lupita Nyong'o carries the psychological complexities of a woman whose identity was shattered by an incident over 30 years earlier and who still gets cut by the shards. What's happening to her is fundamentally inexplicable and unresolvable, so Peele allows that chasm to open up and swallow the rest of the film whole, like a crack in the earth that portends the apocalypse.
It's also possible to receive Us simply as a gripping home invasion thriller, with Adelaide and her family squaring off against these uncanny, relentless attackers whose origins and motives are a mystery. Though Peele has made it emphatically clear that Us is a horror film, not a comedy  the film itself makes the case just fine on its own, frankly  he seizes the opportunity to lighten up the tone, whether through a funny gesture in the middle of a skirmish or through the casting of Tim Heidecker and Elisabeth Moss as a bourgeois couple who seem to be staging their own version of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. Us is a serious film about the American underclass, those who toil out of sight and out of mind. Us is also a lot of fun."
126,JMI_Doc6_Us,JMI,Horror,Negative,Us,"They say lightning doesnt strike twice, but sometimes it does with hit movies.
Ridley Scott followed up his superb The Duellists  which won best first feature at the 1977 Cannes Film Festival  with seminal sci-fi hit Alien two years later, scoring a special effects Oscar for its chest-bursting menace.
Quentin Tarantino topped Reservoir Dogs with Pulp Fiction.
So I was pumped for Jordan Peeles much-hyped sophomore feature Us about a family menaced by stab-happy doppelgangers, after his exhilarating, Oscar-winning debut Get Out smartly rewired the horror genre, lancing rampant racism and creeping white privilege.
Sadly his flash of brilliance totally fizzles this time.
A genuinely unnerving set up in a 1986 fairground totally gets the creak of terror lurking in these places, with a wide-eyed Madison Curry as a young girl attacked by her evil double after being lost in a funhouse mirror hall.
Positing another clever metaphor, with Americans as their own worst enemy, Peele soon loses focus.
Jumping to the present, a goofy but overlong section sets up Black Panther duo Lupita Nyongo and Winston Duke as a married couple taking a break in their wood-surrounded holiday cabin (never a good idea in horror films) with their kids, played by Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex.
Taking too long to get there, Peele flubs an oddly inert home invasion when the familys maniacal scissor-wielding mirror images eventually show up. Basic jump scares abound, but theres no real terror.
We do get a much more brutal attack on the neighbours, including The Handmaids Tales Elisabeth Moss, but a re-run is a re-run.
The films laborious pace is further hampered by Nyongos bad reflection setting out their terms in the worst asthmatic wheezing committed to film since Tom Hardys much-memed Bane.
Peele manages to bury the film in a turgid cement of tedious exposition while still leaving the basic world-building foundations decidedly wobbly.
Get Out already joked about villains monologuing their dastardly plan. Pushing the same punchline here is just lazy.
The patchy humour fares a bit better as the good family gets increasingly violent in their fight back, but its so on the nose it literally references Home Alone. Yeah, we got it.
Pop culture call-outs galore, including an iconic line ripped from the Star Wars saga, only serve to highlight the dearth of new ideas here.
With Peele borrowing liberally from better films like The Shining, it ends up feeling like a tired rehash.
Speaking of which, Im not going to die and be resurrected on a hill claiming the probably unnecessary Pet Sematary reboot is a masterpiece, but it at least has more fun re-animating Stephen Kings zombie cat story with a zippier pace.
Directed by Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer, the movie doesnt give Jason Clarke quite enough space to really work the crazed grief of a father tortured by a devastating accident, but theres just enough here to hurt.
Tinkering with the tragic 1983 novel and the 1989 movie adaptation, it delivers a couple of surprises more welcome than un-dead family members at the door."
127,JMI_Doc7_Us,JMI,Horror,Negative,Us,"Is my own doppelgänger going to kill me if I dont shower Jordan Peeles latest with praise? Am I going to rack my brain with guilt for not loving a movie Im straining to applaud? Or is something deep inside me going to make me, against my better judgment, evade the fact that Us (2019) is not a particularly good movie? It pains me to write this. The writer/director struck gold with Get Out two years ago and deservedly so, tinging each scene with social and emotional discomfort that passed for both abject horror and pitch-black comedy. It was a sterling effort that overflowed with ideas but never tried too hard and, in a choice more admirable in theory than actuality, Peele has decided not to replicate his previous success.
His latest film makes it clear off the bat that this is not a satire or a bonafide social comment. Us is psychological horror in the vein of The Twilight Zone, something that Peele has aped in the past (and is even rebooting). And this works very well at first in how he, both as a writer and a director, approaches his craft with patienceno cheap scares, no silly gimmicks. With Mike Gioulakis (Under the Silver Lake) as cinematographer and a sleeker approach to both light and dark, its clear this movie is going to be something nicer to behold. But then it becomes just as clear that theres far less beneath the surface. Like when most talented filmmakers stretch themselves in too many directions, Us is full of things that just dont cohere.
We start off in 1986 Santa Cruz where young Adelaide (Madison Curry) is on a birthday trip to an oceanside amusement park with her parents (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Anna Diop). It goes well enough for a while, but something takes over her. She wanders into a hall of mirrors where she sees her doppelgänger and, upon reemerging to Mom and Dad, seems to be suffering PTSD. Fast-forward to current day and Adelaide (now played by Lupita Nyongo) is headed on a vacation with her dorky husband Gabe (Winston Duke), daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph), and son Jason (Evan Alex). The lakeside house is nice and all, but Gabe wants to take the family to the ocean. Adelaide resists but gives in for the sake of the family and that night after returning home, they spot a family in the driveway.
Its all of their doppelgängersseething, primal mirror versions of themselves who only seem to act on their ids. Unlike Get Out, though, Peele keeps this central conceit pretty close to the vest for a while. Us works best when its stylish, placing its characters on a literal coast against the unknown and capturing them with a visual style that feels on the verge of wrapping around itself. Inspirations are proud but never obvious ranging from The Shining to Night of the Living Dead to more comical revisionism like Shaun of the Dead. The film is never particularly scary past the first half or so, but it has the suspense needed to be fun.
And then it decides to stretch its premise into full-on comedy. This isnt inherently a bad thing, but Us plays both its psychological horror and slapstick comedy on full tilt to the point that respective sequences never mesh together. Some are admittedly funny, but Peele rarely finds the balance between this broad humor and the human core he sets up earlier. Scenes and set pieces begin to drag on for too long and, although they never become boring, they certainly wear thin, especially once you realize that theyre simple diversions from the themes Peele is trying to address.
Its an almost-two-hour movie thats so frustratingly detached from itself that it falls short of coasting on its entertainment value. Peeles script reverts to hodgepodge social commentary towards the end that, although alluded to at the beginning of the film, is neglected for long enough to deflate any true sense of tension. This is especially evident through family friends Kitty and Josh (Elisabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker), a boho-chic married couple whose own scenes never amount to anything beyond a few amusing gags.
Once Us unveils its deeper intentions, it doesnt enough prove to be that deep at all. Does it stay true to its genre-based promises? Sure, but it doesnt bend them. It pigeonholes them into a mythology too half-baked to work and the twists, while decently executed, prove to miss as often as they hit. And yet I still couldnt bring myself to entirely discredit Peeles attempts here. I just wish they added up to something. Even if Us has deeper meaningsand its clear that it does, especially given how much it telegraphs them allI wonder if Id be paying as much attention to them if Jordan Peele wasnt behind them."
128,JMI_Doc8_Us,JMI,Horror,Negative,Us,"Writer-director Jordan Peeles 2017 Get Out was a brash and intriguing debut, a picture that wrestled with the notion of whether or not America can ever be a post-racial society: Vital and spooky, it refused to hand over easy answers. With the ambitious home-invasion horror chiller Us, Peele goes even deeper into the conflicted territory of class and race and privilege; he also ponders the traits that make us most human. But this time, hes got so many ideas he can barely corral them, let alone connect them. He overthinks himself into a corner, and were stuck there with him.
Lupita Nyongo stars as Adelaide, who has overcome a traumatic childhood experience and now has a family of her own, including husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and two kids: graceful, well-adjusted Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and the slightly more awkward Jason (Evan Alex), who wears a wolfman mask pushed up on his head as a kind of security blanket. We meet the comfortably middle-class Wilson family as theyre heading off on vacation to Santa Cruz, the site of Adelaides childhood ordeal. On their first night away, they look out and see a family of four, mute and stony echoes of themselves, standing in the driveway. From there, Peele unspools a story of shadow people, long forced to live underground but now streaming to the Earths surface to claim, violently, what they feel is rightfully theirs.
The effectiveness of Us may depend on how little you know about it going in, so the spoiler-averse may wish to stop reading here. But its impossible to address any of the movies larger ideas without giving away key plot points: Before long, that shadow family has infiltrated the house, and now that we can get a good look, we see that each of them is a not-quite-right replica of a Wilson, dressed in a red jumpsuit and wielding a pair of menacing-looking shears. At one point a terrified Adelaide asks the other mother, a twin of herself but with vacant, crazy eyes and a demented smile, What are you people? We are Americans, the lookalike responds, in a whispery growl.
Thats a bright, neon-lit Authors Message if ever there was one, though the idea of using a group of sunlight-deprived semi-zombies as a metaphorical element in a parable about class complacency isnt necessarily a bad one. Are you and your family doing great? Do you live in a nice place, drive an expensive car, and have plenty of food for everyone to eat? Be grateful for it. But be aware that there are others who, through no fault of their own, dont live at the same comfort levelor are, in fact, barely surviving. (The Wilsons also have close friends, Josh and Kitty, played by Tim Heidecker and Elisabeth Moss, who have more money and nicer stuff than they do, a source of irritation for Gabe in particular, and another of the movies threads about class consciousness in America.) But Peele doesnt always lay out his ideas clearly. Us isnt always fun to watch; there are stretches where its plodding and dour. Hes overly fond of heavy-duty references, including Biblical ones: A creepy dude holds a sign that reads Jeremiah 11:11. (If you dont know it outright, its the one that goes, Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.) The mood of Us is sometimes chilling, but even then, youre not always sure what, exactly, is chilling you. Maybe its just the feeling of being trapped in an over-air-conditioned lecture hall, because theres a strain of preachiness running through the whole thing."
129,JMI_Doc9_Us,JMI,Horror,Negative,Us,"Jordan Peeles follow-up to Get Out also mines country-city terror, though its point of view is Californian, not bohemian. Unlike Jarmusch, who would never do something so uncool, Peele channels the Steven Spielberg of the early 1980s, the Spielberg who hired director Tobe Hooper to make Poltergeist edgy, but then interfered to ensure it remained family friendly. In Us, Spielbergas a concept, as a theme, and now as a memoryconstrains Peeles vision the same way Spielberg constrained Hooper. Poltergeist is not The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, because whatever that movie was and however much money it made, it was not commercial according to the aesthetic moralities of Hollywood.
Peele is haunted by his Reagan-era childhood and its pop-culture debris, which is understandable, but by compulsively inserting it into his movie Peele makes Us much less frightening than it could have been. Too much of the movie depends on whats on the T-shirts characters wear. Peeles wardrobe choices are supposed to ground the film in specific time periods but also have to perform the function of grounding it thematically. This is a recurrent tic of Hollywood filmmaking that is both distracting and flattering to an audience already primed to hunt for 1970s and 80s shout-outs in every Netflix show. In Us, it lessens the impact of the Hands Across America T-shirt at the films climax. Peele presents a class-divided America using this ironic signifier, but it has the effect of implying that what will unite us as citizens is not class consciousness but liking this film, as one audience, because we get the references.
Lupita Nyongo has no trouble being terrifying and disturbing as both the villain and the hero of Us. The scary, constricted voice she uses for her prison-jumpsuited doppelgänger was performance art, with Laurie Anderson vocals that seemed to come from an LP I couldnt quite remember. Tim Heidecker, as an evil version of the slightly more successful, back-slapping white neighbor, was more genuine in his dangerous frenzy and therefore more frightening. Heidecker comes across as an actual mirror version of himself, revealing in his violence a murderous id hes channeled from comedy.
Us exposes the shadow world of poverty and despair that undergirds the sunny lifestyle of people who are pretty sure, but not quite sure, that theyve made it as middle-class Americans. It peaks during its home invasion scene, after way too much loving/winking establishment of regular family life, the kind of thing Hitchcock or a TV commercial would have done much quicker. Peeles slow buildup to the familys confrontation with the twisted, starved versions of themselves, who seek to eliminate them and take their place, brings something to the screen that black audiences have been denied in Hollywood moviesa chance to see themselves in the Spielbergian glow of alleged American normalcy.
The nightmare image of the jumpsuit-clad doubles in the shadows of the driveway, a family car sticker come to life as menacing paper dolls holding their own scissors, is the highlight of Us. The home invasion is the films best scene, but it doesnt last long enough after all the buildup. It could have been the whole movie from that point, and maybe would have been, in a cheaper film. Somehow the clash between the competing versions of this family ends up muddled in postBlack Swan ballet, the same way Luca Guadagninos ponderous Suspiria remake did. Ballet, as a signifier of class privilege, lacks shock value in something as all-American as Us. Pretending that its eerie and sinister is like hitting all the keys on the organ at once, Phantom of the Opera style; i.e., a cliché, not scary."
130,JMI_Doc10_Us,JMI,Horror,Negative,Us,"I would love to be able to say that Jordan Peeles Us is a worthy follow-up to his fantastic directorial debut Get Out, but Im afraid I just cant. After a genuinely creepy first half, the film very quickly devolves into tedium and over-explanation. It feels directionless, as though Peele created a fantastic horror scenario that he didnt know what to do with. As such, the film plods along, repeating the same beats over and over, until Peele decides somewhat arbitrarily to just get it over with. 
The story involves a family vacationing at their summer home in Santa Cruz. Endearingly-clueless father, Gabe (Winston Duke), attempts to connect with his kids, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex), while his wife, Adelaide (Lupita Nyongo), becomes increasingly agitated. She has a traumatic history with the nearby beach boardwalk and doesnt want her own children to be hurt, as well. Things quickly spiral out of control, though, as their home is invaded by another family that looks exactly like them. 
It is during these moments  as the family is coming to grips with the surreal situation theyre in  that the film excels. Peele shows himself more than capable of ratcheting up the tension until we just cant take it anymore. However, as he starts to widen the scope of the story, more explanation is needed to make sense of these strange goings-on. Peele does try to keep things interesting with the occasional action set piece, but it all begins to feel perfunctory and repetitive. Eventually, I found myself losing interest to the point that I genuinely no longer cared about what I was watching.
The actors are not to blame here. Every member of the cast is quite capable, though I do wish that many of them were given more to do. We get a general idea of who the kids are, but we never truly feel like we know them. And Gabe isnt really explored beyond the superficial dorky dad archetype. It is only the character of Adelaide that we are allowed to get to know, and Lupita Nyongo perfectly captures the characters strength and emotional fragility. She is palpably frightened throughout the film, yet is able to muster up a very realistic courage that never denies that fear, but simply fights through it. Adelaide is an interesting character, and Nyongos performance carries the film.
With such a game cast and haunting tone, I just wish that the film had amounted to more. Being confronted with ones own doppelgänger is a tried-and-true horror premise, and a deeply effective one, because it invites the audience to examine the darker aspects of itself. But it has to remain an intimate affair, lest it become impersonal and generic. Sadly, by broadening the story, it becomes less specific to these characters and their issues and begins to feel more like the director is pontificating, actively rejecting story in favor of theme. 
It is possible to make such choices work, but I dont think Peele quite knows how yet. Horror is a tricky genre, which can allow a filmmaker to explore all manner of cultural, psychological, and political themes. But it needs to be balanced just right, or else key elements get lost. And I think Us loses its sense of urgency the bigger it gets.
Peele seems to realize this, and he decides to bring the story back to Adelaide as she grapples with her traumatic past. Its a smart move, but one that is undercut by a reveal that is lifted straight out of Treehouse of Horror on The Simpsons, and made all the more eye-rolling because it is in no way a surprise. While Nyongo does her best to give this moment weight, she cant quite overcome the inherent shrug of such a non-revelation. 
This isnt to say that Us is totally irredeemable. There is plenty of style and mood to suggest that Jordan Peele continues to have a bright future as a filmmaker. Unfortunately, when comparing this film to his stellar debut, Im not quite as excited for his next film as I was for this one, and that bright future has begun to dim ever so slightly."
131,SHS_Doc1_Arrival,SHS,Sci-Fi,Positive,Arrival,"After screening at Telluride earlier this year, critics have hailed Arrival as a game-changer for director Denis Villeneuve. But where is this change specifically? With the esoteric science fiction of Villeneuve’s Enemy and a female lead akin to Sicario, Villeneuve’s marriage of sci-fi and action drama is the revelation. Arrival couldn’t have arrived (pun intended) at a better time and the film’s message of international cooperation sticks out more than anything else. When twelve mysterious alien pods station themselves throughout the world, questions understandably arise. Doctor Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a linguist, is recruited by the U.S. government to interview the alien beings in the hopes of discovering what they want. Arrival reinstilled my interest in Villeneuve as a director after being in the minority on last year’s Sicario. The film suffers from issues in the presentation of Louise’s character, but it’s less irksome than Emily Blunt in the former film. DP Bradford Young frames Adams against the ship’s ethereal structure and their similarities to Louise’s own sparse life beautifully. Young’s photographic compositions continue to cement him as a promising young talent. Past and futures’ intersection, coupled with Louise and Ian’s (Jeremy Renner) present day mission are like watching a waking dream. This leaves more of a lingering fascination for the aesthetic, as opposed to feeling the story. You have to admire the film’s beauty in its questions rather than live in the present matter of what it’s saying. With the election results tensions are running high, Arrival’s message is what’s important. Eric Heisserer’s script takes a thoughtful approach to first contact, showing a divided world with China and Russia’s wariness turning dangerous. Eerily enough Louise’s pleads for international cooperation are so prescient today as to be prophecy; television news broadcasts show the fear and apprehension of the aliens arrival that produce chills in a post-election world. A key portion of Heisserer’s script is devoted to linguistics and language, with obvious parallels to Jodie Foster’s Contact.  Linguistically dense, audiences might be turned off by the film’s user-manual technical jargon. But with so many action films leaning towards anti-intellectualism, how Arrival embraces knowledge is refreshing. How language becomes misrepresented couldn’t be timelier, and Heisserer believes his audience will get the message, eventually. Adams describes the world of language in a straightforward way that flows as smoothly as the alien language itself. Adams breaking down a sentence to its basic parts is one of my favorite scenes of the year; it’s the English major in me. (It’ll be interesting to put this alongside Alex Garland’s Annihilation next year’s, a similar sci-fi tale with living prose.) Adams is a firecracker as Louise. Her massive intelligence has kept her at a distance from the world, yet she never apologizes. Her performance is quiet and methodical. When the government refuses to listen, she recounts a story about the origins of the word “kangaroo” in one of the film’s few moments of intellectual humor. Jeremy Renner plays second fiddle to Adams (which works out just fine). He doesn’t do anything wow-worthy, but that could be because Adams is such a powerhouse. However, for all Arrival’s good its payload, the human component, becomes a sappy quagmire. The time conceit is apparent from the moment Adams declares “we are so bound by time.” Though the film’s twist presents itself nicely, her statements keep the audience on edge. This opens the door for an abundance of deus ex machina’s. Certain third act moments come from the writers penciling themselves into a corner with the erase button too close at hand. Renner’s Ian is a product of this convenience, acting as Louise’s scientific partner spouting exposition. He situates them as opposites – he sees science as the foundation for civilization; she thinks language is – but there’s no real conflict between the two. By the end he’s there to service the twist and perpetuate the equation that two people of opposite genders working together must always end up together by the end. Though beautifully shot, with a phenomenal performance by Amy Adams it doesn’t set aside how plodding the narrative feels, how perfunctory the supporting cast is, and how the twist does little more than remind us of staid tropes we’ve seen before. Arrival is a necessary film in these trying times. It’s message about cooperation and the ease for miscommunication couldn’t be needed more. But unlike my colleagues praising this as the second coming, I just didn’t see it."
132,SHS_Doc2_Arrival,SHS,Sci-Fi,Positive,Arrival,"Nowadays, there’s usually one: a Gravity, an Avatar, a Life of Pi. An effects feast that seems poised to butt heads, at the Oscars, with a movie like Argo or Spotlight, that sophisticated, actorly drama with accomplished Editing and Cinematography, say, but likely no showy Visual Effects. The Best Picture race has lately felt like a clear choice between two kinds of movies: the technically accomplished, Hollywood-made spectacle, and the sturdy, topical, independent feature. This would seem like an old phenomenon. Oscar winners have long bounced back and forth between your huge spectacles (Titanic, Ben-Hur, The Sound of Music, Gone With the Wind, Braveheart, Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) and your more writerly, actorly small-to-mid-budget dramas (from Ordinary People, Kramer vs. Kramer, and Annie Hall to films the size of The Godfather and A Beautiful Mind). But since only 2009, when the Academy expanded the Best Picture field to 10 possible nominees, has it felt like these two types of films have represented separate camps in the Academy. Perhaps it’s better to put it in Oscar terms. There are movies that appeal to the acting branches (Spotlight) and movies that appeal to everyone on the technical side, the cinematographers, editors, sound and set designers, costumers, makeup artists, and visual-effects wizards who, like the actors, get to nominate only in their own category and for Best Picture. It’s an imperfect science. The Hurt Locker, budgeted at $15 million, feels like the “small indie” of its year only on paper, when you can see how much smaller it is than a megablockbuster like its competitor Avatar. And as a war movie, The Hurt Locker also had a great deal of craft category appeal, with wins in Editing, Sound Editing, and Sound Mixing, and a further nomination in Cinematography. (It won six Oscars total, including for Director and Original Screenplay.) Still, there’s a tangible competitive trend in that, at least so far as the Academy is concerned, the Oscar race comes down to the “best” dramatic powerhouse of the year squaring off with the most impressive movie of the year, with the Hollywood spectacle often losing to the smaller drama. Gravity, Avatar, and Life of Pi lost to 12 Years a Slave, The Hurt Locker, and Argo, respectively. Meanwhile, last year’s technical favorites — Mad Max: Fury Road and The Revenant, two of only five movies in Oscar history to be nominated for every single technical award — lost to Spotlight, a movie with six nominations, including only one in a technical category (Editing). This year, the actorly indie powerhouse is La La Land. The technical powerhouse is … also La La Land. Damien Chazelle’s romantic L.A. musical is only two nominations short of sweeping every possible technical category (it lost out on Makeup and Hairstyling and Visual Effects nods). It happens also to be in the position to pull off the kind of sweep we associate with dramas like The Silence of the Lambs: Best Picture, Director, Actress, and Actor. (Actor, for Ryan Gosling, is unlikely, but, with a Golden Globe in his favor, not impossible.) That makes it a rarity. And it knocks Denis Villeneuve’s Arrival, a presumptive “technical” nominee by typical standards. Arrival has one fewer technical nomination than La La Land, in fact, securing nods in Cinematography, Film Editing, Production Design, Sound Editing, and Sound Mixing. It’s strange to think that Arrival will be overshadowed by a movie that’s trying not to show off. La La Land is a pretty humble affair, with singing leads who can’t sing, low-key costuming, and, generally, an attitude that’s more enthusiast than perfectionist. It’s a weird turn of events — not least because, though La La Land will be feted like a technical accomplishment, it doesn’t wear that distinction comfortably. Arrival does. Arrival appeals to us through its overwhelming vision. I like the look and sound of the movie more than movie itself, which is normal for a movie like this: the attention to detail, the sense of technique, matters as much as the story — and often more. Somehow, the deep, guttural groan of the heptapods’ speech and the constant throb in the sound design whenever we approach their ship tell me just as much about this mysterious alien force as any info-dumping voice-over interlude. The sound design, rumbling in your seat, gives you a sense of something alive. It’s wonderful work. If Arrival were to steal the trophy in any category, I believe it should be for Production Design. Arrival is simply not a movie I can think of, in any way, without my mind dwelling on its incredibly detailed, textured spaces. Thanks to Villeneuve’s production designer, Patrice Vermette, and his set decorator, Paul Hotte, I can’t think of Amy Adams’s face in the movie without also imagining the bright light emitted in the heptapods’ lair. And once my mind goes there, I’m thinking about the texture of the walls in that lair, and how, the first time I saw the movie, I immediately thought of hardened cake frosting — but, like, alien. I think about the precision of her home and professional lives, too: her sparsely designed but still warm home, the constant dusk of her lecture hall and office. Arrival feels strangely compartmentalized, full of visual harmonies — like the huge windows on the world in Louise Banks’s home and in the heptapods’ lair — that are as much feats of production design as they are of the camera’s gaze. It’s thanks to Bradford Young, Villeneuve’s talented cinematographer, that I have a keen memory of those set details and that they become a part of my psychological experience of the movie. I think of Arrival in terms of color: the milky grays of the clouds rolling over the Montana plain; the bright blue of computer screens bouncing off the gray tents on the makeshift army compound; the bright juts of orange against the gray whenever someone wearing a protective radiation suit walks outside. And I think of the chalky white of the heptapods’ world most of all, and the brightly astonished expressions Jeremy Renner and Amy Adams always wear looking into it. It has an extraordinary sense of scale and specificity in its design that, for its charms, La La Land does not have. I believe Arrival to be the better movie, overall, but more importantly, I believe it to be the bigger technical feat."
133,SHS_Doc3_Arrival,SHS,Sci-Fi,Positive,Arrival,"Arrival, the remarkable new film by Denis Villeneuve, begins aptly enough with an arrival—though perhaps not the kind you would expect. A baby is born, and her mother, played by Amy Adams, explains in voiceover, “I used to think to this was the beginning of your story.” We see the girl’s life, in flashback—games of cowboy, arguments, reconciliations—as her mother continues, “I remember moments in the middle ... and this was the end.” We see the girl, now a teenager, in a hospital bed. Then we see the bed empty. The sequence—a brief life encompassed in still briefer summary—is surely among the most heartbreaking since Michael Giacchino’s magnificently versatile waltz carried us through the “Married Life” segment of Up. And while at first it appears to be mere backstory for Adams’s character, it is in fact much more, perhaps the most crucial thread in Villeneuve’s intricately woven film. Adams plays Dr. Louise Banks, a world-class linguist whom the Army once asked for help with a Farsi translation. “You made quick work of those insurgent videos,” a Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) reminds her; “you made quick work of those insurgents,” she rebuts. The Army needs her help once again, although this time the work is decidedly more esoteric: Aliens have arrived on Earth in a dozen giant craft scattered across the globe, one of them in the wilds of Montana. Colonel Weber would like Louise to come with him, learn the aliens’ language, and ask them why they’re here. On the flight into Big Sky Country, she is introduced to her partner in this endeavor, a genial physicist named Ian Donelly (Jeremy Renner, looking relieved that no one expects him to lug around a bow and quiver). Villeneuve clearly knows his Godzilla, and like Ishiro Honda he takes his time before revealing his leviathan. As the chopper bearing the scientists skims over the plains, the alien craft emerges, literally, from the mist: a 1,500-foot edifice of what looks like black rock floating weightlessly just above the ground, like a giant skipping-stone poised on one tip. Accompanied by soldiers and technicians, Louise and Ian enter the craft by means of a square shaft in its base. Once inside, however, gravity releases them and then shifts 90 degrees, such that the shaft is now a corridor and one of its walls the floor. It is a dizzying moment for Louise and Ian, and no less so for the audience, like when Fred Astaire danced his way up the wall in Royal Wedding. As Ian responded to the sudden inversion with “holy fuck,” I was right there with him. At the end of the corridor they meet their hosts, two giant, squid-like beings that float on the other side of a transparent barrier. Louise and Ian call them “heptapods” owing to their seven symmetrical tentacles, and name the two “Abbott” and “Costello,” because, well, why not? Efforts at verbal communication are unsuccessful, but written language proves more promising. From their starfish-like hands, the heptapods can emit swirling circles of inky gas, each one of them—as Louise concludes—a fully formed sentence with neither beginning nor end. Communication with the creatures moves slowly, but it at least begins to move. Like Villeneuve’s recent films Sicario and Prisoners, the movie is at once evocative and mysterious. As events unspool, we can sense that—like Louise with the heptapods—we do not entirely comprehend them. (We are correct in this.) As she and Ian try to decode the creatures’ language, they are constrained in their efforts by Colonel Weber and, especially, a CIA agent named Halpern (Michael Stuhlbarg). Until we know more of the aliens’ intentions—conquest? tourism? cup of sugar?—Weber and Halpern are greatly concerned that we do not accidentally teach them more about ourselves than we learn about them. Moreover, there are geopolitics to consider. Eleven other craft hover elsewhere on Earth: Shanghai, Siberia, Sudan, Sierre Leone, and even a few places not starting with “s.” What if China or Russia makes a breakthrough with the aliens first and uses what it learns against the United States? What if shots are fired, bringing alien wrath down upon the whole globe? Already their arrival has enveloped America in a sense of dread and anxiety not seen since—well, this entire political season. Looting breaks out in the cities; Pentecostals self-immolate; talk-radio tough guys demand “a show of force, a shot across their bows.” The look of Arrival is stately and elegant; its pace, sober and deliberate. This is Villeneuve’s first collaboration with the cinematographer Bradford Young, who shot my two favorite films of 2014 in A Most Violent Year and Selma. The score, by the frequent Villeneuve contributor Jóhann Jóhannsson, is multifaceted and occasionally spellbinding, not least when its low horns boom with menace, almost like an alien voice themselves. The script is by Eric Heisserer, who cunningly adapted and expanded it from a short story by Ted Chiang. It’s tempting to describe Arrival as “thinking person’s science fiction.” And while I will not descend to such hokey nomenclature, there’s a reason you’ll probably see that phrase plenty in conjunction with the film. It would be a disservice to describe how the plot unfolds any further, as Villeneuve releases information gradually and viewers will likely clue into the film’s true meaning at different points in its evolution. Suffice to say that Arrival is a “twist” movie, but the twist is more than a mere gimmick. Like Christopher Nolan’s Memento, it is central not only to the film’s narrative but also to its moral architecture—which, like Memento’s, concerns itself with questions of time, memory, and human choice. This is precisely the kind of science-fiction movie, at once epic and intimate, that Interstellar tried (and failed) to be. The entire cast is strong, but Arrival is Adams’s movie from the first frame to the last. I confess that I initially thought that her gifts might be wasted on such space-invader fare, but the performance she gives is mesmerizingly open, by turns uplifting and sorrowful. If you are unmoved by the film’s conclusion, then you are made of considerably harder stuff than I. As awards season gets under way, there are several promising movies visible hovering on the horizon. But for now, the best film of the year, ambitious in conception and extraordinary in execution, has arrived."
134,SHS_Doc4_Arrival,SHS,Sci-Fi,Positive,Arrival,"Arrival plays with your head as gently as any sci-fi thriller I can remember. Director Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Prisoners) is a filmmaker who, for all his skills, is sometimes a too proud of his showmanship and intellect. So it’s a relief, and a pleasant surprise, to see him so kind and open-hearted in Arrival, a movie that plays around with your emotions, but never in a way that feels manipulative. This is an alien invasion movie with few aliens, a big Hollywood release with few explosions, and a twisty-plot that holds you comfortably by the hand into, and out of, the abyss. It’s an impressive accomplishment. Amy Adams plays Dr. Louise Banks, a world-renowned linguist who, when we meet her, is teaching at a university and mourning the death of her child . One day, twelve massive floating orbs appear suddenly in locations all over the world. They seem to be trying to communicate with us, but because no one can understand them, the military calls in Dr. Banks to see if she can decipher their language, to see if they are hostile. Working alongside a scientist (Jeremy Renner), Dr. Banks begins to slowly form a bond with the aliens—too slowly for the antsy military leaders of the United States and China. The film becomes a race between Dr. Banks, who’s trying to figure out what the aliens are trying to tell us, and the warmongers ready to blow them out of the sky. This makes Arrival sound like more of a conventional thriller than it really is, but to be fair, Villeneuve lulls us in with a character arc that, at first glance, doesn’t look that much different than Gravity, another thoughtful science-fiction moonshot. (A female protagonist who has lost a child uses her intelligence and ingenuity to assess an impossible situation.) He also gives Dr. Banks some rather silly stock characters to bump up against—Michael Stuhlbarg is mostly wasted as a bureaucrat who exists solely to be wrong. But Villeneuve is up to something more ambitious here. Dr. Banks is attempting to solve a mystery while still wrestling with her own demons, and as a filmmaker he shoots in a way that, intriguingly, seems to mix the two. At first it seems much more stock than it is—Basic Backstory 101—but that’s just Villeneuve slowly pulling the rug out from under you. There are twists, but they always feel organic to the story Villeneuve is telling. He’s playing a trick, but he’s not trying to trick you. This is the sort of movie that M. Night Shyamalan would bungle. Much of this can be ascribed to Adams, one of our finest actresses, who has a terrific part to dig into here. Dr. Banks is brilliant but never showy, with a steely resolve that seems, at least at first, to be a direct result of her family tragedy. She’s scared of these aliens and what this might mean for her world, but more than anything she’s fascinated: This is the greatest challenge of her professional career, and you see Adams embrace it and grow increasingly enthusiastic and compelled. The movie has an uncommon faith in intelligence for a Hollywood movie about aliens, and it’s telling that we barely see the aliens at all, and then only in shadow and hidden by clouds. The movie isn’t about aliens: It’s about how we communicate with one another, and how that communication is vital to our understanding of the world. Dr. Banks learns to speak the language of the aliens, not just to figure out what they have to tell us, but what we must know ourselves. Adams is the perfect actress for this part: tough and tender, vulnerable but eager, and above all absolutely committed to unraveling this mystery. When the conclusion of Arrival comes, it’s with a shock, but a deeply satisfying one: When you understand what has been happening, it all clicks that of course this is where this story was going all along. But the movie doesn’t suffer from excessive self-regard like some of Villaneuve’s other films. He keeps himself mostly in check here, trusting his story and carefully guiding us along the way. This is a smart, almost cerebral film that leaves you in the dark for most of the way before revealing, at the exact right moment, that this all was much more about the heart than the head. Arrival is a science fiction film about the value of knowledge, the warmth of connection and the vitality of communication. It’s about listening, and being heard, and learning. In a film of this scope, this kind of message feels downright revolutionary."
135,SHS_Doc5_Arrival,SHS,Sci-Fi,Positive,Arrival,"The slender short story that inspired this ambitious “first contact” film contains discussions of Fermat’s principle and diagrammatical explanations of refracted light, hardly a blueprint for a multiplex-friendly fantasy flick. Yet from the atemporal monologue of Ted Chiang’s Story of Your Life, in which the narrator remembers events in the future tense, screenwriter Eric Heisserer has spun an admirable script for a film as cerebrally adventurous as it is emotionally accessible. Confidently directed by French-Canadian film-maker Denis Villeneuve, making his first foray into the sci-fi genre before the forthcoming Blade Runner sequel, Arrival charts a bold course between the guiding stars of Robert Zemeckis’s Contact and Steven Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind, with just a hint of the gravitational pull of Andrei Tarkovsky’s Solaris. “I used to think this was the beginning of your story,” says Dr Louise Banks (Amy Adams) over the opening strains of Max Richter’s On the Nature of Daylight, a theme to which Arrival will return significantly in its closing stanzas. With startling economy, Villeneuve conjures a snapshot portrait of motherhood cut short by a daughter’s death; love and despair described with surgical precision. From such tragedy we move with equal economy to the titular event – a string of spaceships spanning the globe for reasons unknown. Leading linguist Dr Banks is promptly pressed into service as an interplanetary translator, teamed with Jeremy Renner’s tetchy-but-cute physicist Ian Donnelly, who insists that “the cornerstone of civilisation isn’t language, it’s science”. Together, this star-crossed pair must venture into the void, attempting to converse with creatures who are seen through a glass darkly,and who communicate via inky circles, what Chiang calls “mandalas... in which premises and conclusions were interchangeable”. Forest Whitaker’s typically terse army intelligence officer wants quick answers: “What do they want? Where are they from?” But for Banks, understanding these visitors will require a more intuitive, elliptical approach. Although the spectre of low-hanging spaceships encircling the world seems to evoke the apocalyptic iconography of Independence Day, it’s the rough-hewn beauty of British director Gareth Edwards’s ironically titled Monsters to which Arrival owes the greater debt. From the “dirty sci-fi” aesthetic of Bradford Young’s tactile cinematography to the gentle, odd-couple chemistry of Adams and Renner, there’s an intimacy here that resonates with Edwards’s 2010 low-budget debut. In contrast to such human touches, the pebble-shaped alien vessels are impressively otherworldy, eerily recalling Douglas Adams’s description of spaceships that “hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don’t”. Once inside these shells, production designer Patrice Vermette’s sets seem every bit as unearthly as HR Giger’s Alien environments – vast and unknowable, their otherness accentuated by Jóhann Jóhannsson’s score. Yet even in these surroundings we can still feel Louise’s all-too-human heartbeat, with Amy Adams’s talent for telegraphing tangible emotions via tiny facial gestures shining through the isolating wrap of an orange hazmat suit. Anyone familiar with the Tralfamadorians of Kurt Vonnnegut’s 1969 novel Slaughterhouse-Five, who view time as permanent, like “a stretch of the Rocky Mountains”, will recognise the underlying themes, both philosophical and emotional, which make Louise Banks a latterday Billy Pilgrim. Yet while the source codes may be familiar, there’s a pleasing clarity to Arrival’s dramatisation of such complex concepts as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, a theory that language defines cognition, which Dr Banks experiences first hand. While the military hawks press for strategic advantage, Louise finds her world reordered by alien semantics (“Are you dreaming in their language?’), notions of joy and grief refracted through the prism of a linguistic stargate. As befits the director of Incendies and Sicario, Villeneuve also injects a sociopolitical edge into the fantasy narrative, with growing international tensions and calls for an armed response striking a very contemporary nerve, alongside tense discussion about understanding “the difference between a weapon and a tool”. Yet such adornments remain secondary to the core story of parental bonds transcending time and space, locating this in the same cinematic constellation as Christopher Nolan’s equally touching Interstellar. “They should have sent a poet,” said Jodie Foster’s astronaut Dr Ellie Arroway in Contact, another character haunted by the loss of a loved one, locked in a galaxy-spanning battle between facts and faith. At a time when some of us, appalled by events on Earth, are looking to the stars for reassurance that love can indeed trump tragedy, Arrival may be just the poem we need; a departure from the dystopian visions which now appear all too real, a memory of a future in which light still shines in the darkness."
136,SHS_Doc6_Arrival,SHS,Sci-Fi,Negative,Arrival,"Can a science-fiction film be Oscar bait? Eons ago—in 2009—this would have been a ridiculous question. Prior to that year, only three such movies had ever been nominated for best picture: A Clockwork Orange, Star Wars, and E.T. But in the seven years since the category expanded beyond five nominees, seven films from the genre have been nominated. Most have tended towards the brainy (Her), the mind-bending (Inception), and the wonky (The Martian). All together—with the possible exception of Mad Max: Fury Road—this batch of sci-fi nominees seems less interested in escapist thrills than in scientific accuracy (see also Gravity) and political allegory (Avatar, District 9). They’re popcorn as engineered through molecular gastronomy. Enter Arrival. The new film from Denis Villeneuve checks each and every one of these boxes. It’s brainy, with its hero linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) offering explications of concepts like the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis. It’s mind-bending, reveling in the kind of time paradoxes that dare you to diagram them with elaborate flowcharts. And it’s wonky, with its other main character, a theoretical mathematician played by Jeremy Renner, explaining one of the film’s twists by revealing that .083333 … is (spoiler alert?) precisely equivalent to 1/12. And like many recent prestige sci-fi movies (and so many nonprestigious ones), Arrival focuses on alien contact. That alien race first appears around the globe in giant, somewhat Sphere-ical spaceships—and thanks to the film’s coy marketing strategy, you probably have no idea what they look like. (I won’t spoil their appearance, which is relatively novel, except to say: Why do movie aliens always have to be green?) This restraint is admirable, but it’s also, arguably, born of necessity. If you go into this mid-budget film with the expectation that it will erupt into a third-act CGI spectacle, you will be disappointed. Instead, the film’s tagline “Why are they here?” is in fact its driving question. Most of the action, such as it is, involves Amy Adams’ linguist and Jeremy Renner’s mathematician trying to speak to the aliens and figure out what they’re saying back. All the chat about nonlinear orthography can get a bit academic, and its dominant motif also functions as a kind of microcosm of all these brainy, high-toned sci-fi movies: scientists pointing markers at whiteboards while explaining the inner workings of the plot. There’s another film, of course, that checked all these boxes, whiteboards and all, and received a lot of Oscar buzz—though it ultimately failed to convert all this into a best picture nomination. And like Interstellar, Arrival is only intermittently stellar. Indeed, it resembles, above all, that and other Christopher Nolan movies. Its idea-heavy dialogue is often clunky, such as when Adams’ voice-over muses, “We are so bound by time. By its order.” (Yeah, man.) Selma cinematographer Bradford Young’s carefully composed images are mostly drained of color. The mood is mournful, even though the dead girl being mourned (another common feature of Nolan’s films) only appears in visions and flashbacks. Its score, courtesy of the brilliant Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson, is eerie and romantic, but it’s reminiscent less of Brahms than brAAAAHMS. And it has a twist ending that will leave you puzzling over the mechanics of its rug-pulling. Watching it, I was excited that such a strange piece of science fiction got made—and disappointed to realize that it is strange in just about all the ways that Interstellar is. But while even Nolan’s detractors couldn’t deny his skill at manufacturing awe, the primary emotion that Arrival evokes is puzzlement. For most of the film’s runtime, the two main characters remain, like the aliens’ language, ciphers; the great actors Michael Stuhlbarg and Forest Whitaker, meanwhile, mostly serve the familiar roles of the hawkish military man and the confused audience surrogate (i.e. the Ariadne). Meanwhile, though there are moments of striking, inventive imagery—such as an Inception-like journey down a hallway whose gravity pulls in more than one direction—they are brief. Still, it’s perhaps unfair to compare this mid-budget, $47 million feature to the work of our most successful creator of original mega-budget films, and there are also ways in which Arrival improves on Nolan’s work. For one, it actually passes the Bechdel test (either just barely or, depending on the gender identity of the aliens, with flying colors). This is not surprising from director Villeneuve, whose last film was the war-on-drugs thriller Sicario, which similarly centered on a woman who is as tough as the men who surround her. But Arrival has another theme, and although it’s secondary, it’s the one that is likely to stand out most to moviegoers watching the movie after the election of President Trump. The movie depicts a divided world where people struggle to understand each other, where panic leads groups to wall themselves off, watch their own media, and burrow deeper into their own bunkers. In the end, of course, our heroes figure out how to transcend these barriers—but the solution is a deus ex machina beamed down by the extraterrestrials. For all the movie’s attention to whiteboards and arcane linguistic theories, this week it feels like a total fantasy."
137,SHS_Doc7_Arrival,SHS,Sci-Fi,Negative,Arrival,"Denis Villeneuve’s latest is an artier — certainly moodier and less entertaining, thanks to Amy Adams’s deeply inward protagonist and a blue-gray palette designed to contrast the barren present with the fruitful past — version of M. Night Shyamalan’s Signs. That is, it’s an alien-landing movie in which the alien landing is revealed to be not the point, but rather, the thing that helps to reveal the point. There, the revelation was that faith is possible because things really do happen for a reason. Here...well, there’s no sense in spoiling things, but there’s a reason why Adams’s opening voiceover states that she’s not sure she believes in beginnings and endings. It might have helped if the story had spent more time considering the ostensible issue: how to communicate with aliens who write with (admittedly captivating) coffee-cup stains? (Did nobody think to draw a pictograph? How do both sides make the leap from concrete to abstract? Etc.) Also maybe the actual issue. Because...everyone dies eventually? And spouses shouldn’t keep life-or-death secrets from each other?"
138,SHS_Doc8_Arrival,SHS,Sci-Fi,Negative,Arrival,"There are days in human experience that shatter our understanding of the world, forcing us to reconsider what we thought we knew as we struggle to piece things back together. Denis Villeneuve's elegiac science-fiction drama ""Arrival"" follows the aftermath of such a day, and the emotional tidal waves it eventually unleashes. Based on Ted Chiang's short tale ""The Story of Your Life,"" ""Arrival"" focuses on an alien invasion of Earth. But this is not a spectacle-packed action flick in the vein of ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Independence Day"" or even a suspenseful sci-fi thriller like ""Gravity"" or ""Ex Machina."" Instead, Villeneuve's follow-up to his lauded crime-drama ""Sicario"" offers a much subtler and more solemn exploration of this sci-fi subgenre. Focusing on linguistics professor Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), ""Arrival"" guides us through the American government's earnest but anxious efforts to make sense of an alien invasion that's placed enormous floating vessels above 12 seemingly random spots around the globe, including rural Montana. Villeneuve's film kicks off with the dizzying reality of these mysterious extraterrestrial's arrival. It was an average day until that moment. Louise strides into her lecture perplexed by the poor attendance. The students seem distracted, checking their phones, until one entreats her to turn the classroom's television to the news. And just like that, with one simple, striking image, the world as we know it is different. The Canadian filmmaker doesn't indulge in melodramatic gnashing of teeth or cries of shock. And this grounds the film in an eerie authenticity. Watching this simple scene -- that admittedly contains no violence -- I was reminded how on 9/11, I sat in a college class, confused when a peer whispered something about a plane crash in Manhattan. As we joined the masses of students who steadily filed out of the campus and onto buses, subways and sidewalks, the quiet was rattling. Horrified and confused, many of us didn't seem to know what to say, and so we stared, scared and silent, awaiting whatever comes next. How do you make sense of the unimaginable? That is the question playing at the core of Villeneuve's daring drama that refuses to gussy itself up with scares or outlandish stunts. Nobly pressing on to communicate with these cryptic creatures, Louise teams with a brash scientist (Jeremy Renner), racing to decode the extraterrestrial's language and thereby their purpose on Earth. Meanwhile, China teeters on the brink of igniting intergalactic war. All the while, Villeneuve's cast--which boasts solid supporting turns by Forest Whitaker and Michael Stuhlbarg--strives for tension and poignance through strained discussions about the importance of language to perspective. It's an interesting concept, and a remarkably restrained film, rich with foreboding. I admire Villeneuve ambition and appreciate the humane message that beats at the heart to his story. But as the plot clunks from one tame close encounter to another, I became increasingly, unsalvageably bored. This is decidedly not my kind of sci-fi. The understated performances completely make sense within the world of a military installment striving for a peaceful resolution. Carrying an incredible yet casual gravitas, Adams is intriguing as this under-pressure civilian. But with no action, weak suspense and little mirth, the tone steadily becomes a relentless one-note dirge. Though seemingly sophisticated, ""Arrival"" squanders its strong start with a plodding pace that trudges through a maudlin mood toward a finale that indulges in one of sci-fi's most infuriating deus ex machina tropes. Though initially fascinating, Villeneuve's indulgence in mood and melancholy mount to a conclusion that wastes its compelling premise and wallows in infuriatingly all-consuming sentimentality."
139,SHS_Doc9_Arrival,SHS,Sci-Fi,Negative,Arrival,"How do you create a movie about space aliens and still make it seem new? This is the conundrum posed, and not all that ably resolved, by “Arrival,” which stars Amy Adams as Dr. Louise Banks, a linguistics professor who is tasked by the US military with figuring out how to communicate with the squiggly, squidlike extraterrestrials whose spaceships, landed on Earth, resemble an immense ultrasleek cough drop. It begins promisingly, with scattershot TV reports of the alien landings inciting increasing dread. A reluctant Louise is recruited by an Army colonel (Forest Whitaker) to decode the squealing language of the aliens, whose spaceships are ominously parked at 12 locations around the world. We have already been given a quick rundown on Louise’s fraught life leading up to this moment: the unexplained loss of her husband and the death of her only child, a daughter, to cancer. Her mournfulness is all of a piece with the film’s pallid, grayish ambience. Earth may well be worth saving, but “Arrival” doesn’t exactly make the best case for it. The mounting, low-key anxiety serves the film well for a while because Denis Villeneuve, directing from a script by Eric Heisserer, makes you believe that, yes, this is the way it might really happen if aliens landed. It’s also believable that the arrivals might touch off a global game of chicken, with Russia and China pushing the brinkmanship. Fairly soon, alas, it becomes clear that Villeneuve (“Sicario,” “Prisoners”) is a director lacking not only humor but also a sense of the transcendent. The humorlessness is partially forgivable, although I must say I have been spoiled ever since “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” which managed to be both loads of fun and mind-boggling. (This is what “The Martian” also aimed for, and missed.) But it’s difficult to get worked into a state of awe with this film because so much of it is so sodden. I half wished the aliens would blow something real big up just to break the monotony, but it turns out they are friendly – sort of. They eject squid ink-like messages that, once decoded, mean something like “We come in peace.” Turns out they want to literally change the way earthlings think by rewiring our brain circuits with their language, which, once learned, can alter our space-time continuum. Or at least Louise’s. Or something like that. I guess it doesn’t matter exactly what this film is about. Except it does. When we’ve come this far, I rightly expect that all this  circle-of-time hoo-ha will amount to something more than a great big “Huh?” A halfhearted attempt is made by the filmmakers to give Louise a love interest: a theoretical physicist, played by Jeremy Renner, whose quota of “Aha!” moments is thankfully kept to a minimum. Unfortunately, just about everything about this guy is kept to a minimum. He’s a plot device, except, of course, there isn’t much of a plot. I realize I’m not supposed to be so cavalier about a movie that clearly is aiming for Importance – not to mention Oscars – but it would take a hardier soul than I am to suppress a snicker when Louise enters the spaceship’s dismal, honeycombed interior, bravely sheds her orange hazmat suit, and holds up a sign saying “Human.” Unless there’s something truly momentous going on, I prefer my sci-fi to be a lot more weightless than weighty. Grade: C+ (Rated PG-13 for brief strong language.)"
140,SHS_Doc10_Arrival,SHS,Sci-Fi,Negative,Arrival,"At first, they look like giant black eggs hovering in the sky. Seen up close and in profile, they are more like the dark slashes in a Lucio Fontana canvas. These are the extraterrestrial spacecraft in Arrival, which appear suddenly one morning and plonk themselves in assorted locations across the planet with little or no regard for parking restrictions. Arrival itself is less unexpected. Early November is the official launch period for adult-oriented science-fiction movies angling for awards recognition: Gravity, Interstellar and The Martian were all released in that slot and Arrival contains DNA carefully extracted from each. From Interstellar, it lifts a circular plot structure, signalled far in advance by an opening speech disputing the notion of beginnings and endings. From The Martian, it takes its pragmatic approach to a fantastical situation, represented in the new film by the challenge of communicating with alien visitors. Most importantly, Arrival borrows from Gravity a grieving female protagonist, in this case the linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams), who is mourning the loss of her daughter. The screenwriter Eric Heisserer, working from a short story by Ted Chiang, knows that there can be no faster route to empathy than a dead child, and the director, Denis Villeneuve, finds the appropriate visual register for a montage of the girl’s life in the soft hues and artful blurs redolent of a commercial for private health care. Louise lives alone in a stylishly chilly waterfront property, far too pricey for an academic to afford but spacious enough to denote emotional desolation. So when the US government requests that she join the physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) to instigate a conversation with the aliens, the project provides respite from her grief. Inside the spacecraft docked in Montana, they converse through a gleaming white rectangle that suggests a blank cinema screen. Tentacles figure strongly in the composition of the creatures, who communicate by honking like trombones and spraying inky characters on the screen for Louise to decipher. It is fitting that these splodges resemble Rorschach blots, since the film is concerned not with the enigmas of an exotic species but with what the extraterrestrials’ existence might reveal about the human race. Where Close Encounters of the Third Kind gazed outward in awe at the universe, Arrival asks only how its mysteries might provide succour and illumination for us. It couldn’t be any more parochial in its outlook if Louise and Ian were shown posing for selfies with the aliens. As the story loops round on itself and Louise’s memories of her daughter start to provide clues and pointers, the film becomes carried away by its attempts at profundity. The past is the future . . . The future is the present . . . The child had a palindromic name . . . She made clay models that predicted what the aliens would look like . . . In a movie, the air of cosmic spookiness is less impressive than in life, because these are not really coincidences at all but markers placed in advance by the film-makers over the course of many drafts. A genuinely magical picture (Donnie Darko, say) generates a mystique that outlasts its plot surprises. Arrival is the opposite sort of film. Though secular in nature, its promises of continuous life make it as simplistically comforting as any religious parable. It may have escaped the director’s attention also that Nicolas Roeg has made a long and wonderful career out of exploring, with a good deal less fanfare, the idea that is central to his film. In Walkabout, Don’t Look Now and Bad Timing, the past, present and future exist simultaneously and it takes only a snip of the editor’s scissors to move between those time frames. For Villeneuve, however, cinema is all about making big statements, and damn the details. He doesn’t notice, in the process of telling Louise’s story, that the aliens are relegated to the status of McGuffins in their own movie or that the entire world is nudged to the very brink of war just so that a well-off university professor can sleep more soundly at night."
141,YPV_Doc1_TheRing,YPV,Horror,Positive,The Ring,"A remake of a Japanese film titled Ringu (1998), which I have yet to see, The Ring (2002) is a genuinely creepy tale of a cursed video, one that results in the death of anyone, within seven days, who happens to watch it...directed by Gore Verbinski, who's found a lot of success with the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, the film stars Naomi Watts (Ned Kelly, King Kong) as an investigative reporter who comes across the aforementioned tape after a relative dies mysteriously. Also appearing is Martin Henderson (Smokin' Aces), David Dorfman (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), Jane Alexander (The Cider House Rules), Daveigh Chase (Stitch! The Movie), and Brian Cox (The Bourne Identity, X2).

As the movie, set in the Seattle area, begins we see two teenage girls alone in a large house, and soon their conversation turns to the stuff urban legends are made of, specifically in terms of the existence of a video tape that, when watched, will result in a creepy phone call stating the viewer has seven days to live. As it turns out, one of the girls just happened to have watch said tape a week ago and, well, I won't describe anymore but I will say some seriously bad mojo soon ensues as the girl who watched the tape has her chips prematurely cashed in while her friend suffers a complete mental collapse resulting her being institutionalized. So how does Naomi Watts, who plays the character Rachel Keller, fit into it all? Well, she just happens to be the aunt of the dead girl, along with also being an investigative reporter and a single mother of a creepy little kid named Aidan (Dorfman). Realizing there may be a story here, especially after learning a few of her niece's friends died mysterious the same time as the girl (they all watched the tape at the same time), Rachel begins digging, eventually coming across the tape (and watching it), and soon begins to fear for her own life, with good reason. Hoping to learn more about the images on the video, she contacts an acquaintance named Noah (Henderson), who specializes in graphic mediums, and shows him the tape (apparently it wasn't enough that she alone be cursed). Noah's skeptical, believing it's some sort of crummy, student film but soon changes his tune as the strange vibes Rachel has been experiencing since watching the tape begin to invade his reality. Rachel's research eventually leads her and Noah upstate to a dilapidated horse farm (that has no horses), run by a man named Richard Morgan (Cox), whose wife and daughter, both featured prominently on the tape, have since died under mysterious circumstances (seems the wife was a bit nutty, while the daughter was, well...). Anyway, Rachel and Noah make some important revelations, ones that may help remove the `curse', that is if they don't run out of time (seven days goes by quickly when you've got the monkey of death on your back).

I avoided seeing this when it originally came out, as there was so much buzz flying about, and for some reason I thought the film would be swathed in pretension. I finally did watch it about a year and a half ago, and then again last night, and after doing so, I was very impressed. I definitely believe this is a film in need of multiple viewings, at least for me, as the first time I saw it my focus was primarily on the ookie visuals, so much so I missed bits and pieces of the story. Subsequently, by the end of the first go around, I wasn't entirely sure what the hell was going on, specifically in terms of the ending. Now, in watching again last night, I tended to focus more on the story, picking up those minor, but important, elements I missed the first time around, and things made a whole lot more sense...not that I didn't feel there wasn't a plot hole or two, but nothing large enough to drive a bus through. The story has an ever present sense of doom and gloom, partly due to the Seattle setting (Seattle is notorious for its wet weather), but also because of the material itself as I never really got the impression that even if Rachel could solve the mystery, she'd rid herself of the curse. Also it should be known that none of the characters are particularly pleasant as Rachel, a single, working mother, at least initially, seemed more focused on her career than her son, and Noah, whose role I purposely left ambiguous, came off as a complete a-hole (check out the scene with Noah and Aidan in the car and you'll see what I mean). Even the kid Aidan came off all creepy and such, especially when referring to his mother by her name rather than calling her `mom'. Despite my being put off by these characters none really seemed deserving of the fate they were destined for, so I did find myself interested in their relative well being (Rachel's attitudes change slightly as the story moves along, but I'm still unsure if it was due to a mother's love or her own sense of self preservation), except for maybe Noah. While I may not have liked the characters all that much, I thought the performances were well done, and the direction taut and engaging. The pacing was solid and even, as the story never really got tiresome or boring. I did like the twists at the end, one of which involved Noah and provided for one of the more memorable and disturbing visuals in the film. All in all I thought this a very well made, nightmarish affair, one worth watching at least twice of only to pick up on that which may have been missed the first time around. As far as those who've seen the film, was I the only one who found that fingernail bit within the cursed video extremely uncomfortable to watch? That's a pain that will linger...

The picture, presented in widescreen anamorphic (1.85:1), comes across very well, and the audio, available in DTS 5.1 Surround (English), Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround (English and French), and Dolby Surround 2.0 (English), is strong and clear. Extras, which aren't much, include subtitles in English, Spanish, and French, a short film by Gore Verbinski, one that apparently utilizes footage shot but not used in the final release of the film, and trailers for Ringu (1998), Catch Me If You Can (2002), and 8 Mile (2002). Also included, as a slightly hidden feature, is a complete showing of the material present on the `cursed' tape, which last roughly two minutes, if you dare..."
142,YPV_Doc2_TheRing,YPV,Horror,Positive,The Ring,"The Ring is one of my favorite horror movie. It is a remake of japanese horror film named RINGU. The introduction to this film is very smart. After few minutes into the film you realize just how mature and suspenseful of a film this really is. The characters are great. Rachael Keller is the perfect journalist. Noah Clay is sort of a comic relief, he's sarcastic and stubborn but is also very smart. Film is very unique in it's style, full of flash backs, creepy imagery, nightmares, mysteries, and hallucinations. It's very bizarre and surreal at times, which isn't very out of place since this is a supernatural horror/thriller. Overall, I would recommend this movie to any one with intelligence and an imagination. It is an amazing horror movie. I loved it and so will you, trust me.
Instead of going with the flow the horror genre, this film boldly branches off and successfully stands out. It won't give you the gore shock (except for the tape viewing scene, which is very gorey and well done), it won't give you the jumpscare shock (except for the singular, very well done jumpscare), but instead it will fill you with genuine terror, which is what the genre should be all about. I saw this version before the original when I was in high school, it became the movie of the moment and since I have been a fan of horror movies since I was a child, this was a must that I said would not scare me. I watched it at midnight and I regretted it, stopped my VHS and finished it in the morning. It scared me that much. Over the years I realized that it is not a perfect movie but in general terms it is totally worth it. When I was younger I naturally found this movie much more frightening and entertaining, then one day I watched Ringu and realized that it wasn't as strong as its source material and while Naomi Watts does an excellent job and the scares are plenty in The ring(USA) it falls slightly shorter than Ringu and lacks a certain authenticity. Certainly not a bad movie by any means and is far better than a large number of remakes do (especially with the J Horror genre). Watch it if you want a good shot of early 2000's horror. Solid but superficial at the end of the day.I've been watching horror movies for a long time, and I always consider myself to be some what this one wasn't. Certain images were unexpected and shocking to me. The plot is well-placed and the setting dark and dreary. Such natural things in the world are given new meaning within the film's context. Watching it again 18 years later, I know what to expect, but it still gives me shivers. This is a solid horror/suspense film and I appreciate it in light of the tendency towards gore which followed. One of my favorite movies ever, The Ring is a must see for horror enthusiasts. It is the only movie to make me loose sleep! Creepy, suspenseful, and fast paced, all with good timing. ""You weren't supposed to help her."""

I watched this movie as a kid and I'M STILL SCARRED. This movie made me scared of my own reflection, though I am easily frightened I still feel like this movie is one of the creepiest movies of the early 2000's. It's a creative film that reveals parts of the story little by little, always revealing new information that keeps you on your toes. Samara crawling out of the tv, being thrown down the well by her own mom, and of course the tape will always be an iconic part of horror.The Ring is a decent movie, elevated by a strong performance from Naomi Watts. Its main issue is that it is too tame (as it is PG13). Compared to other Asian Horror remakes, however, The Ring stands out among the crowd as a creepy time passer with memorable moments.BEST.SCARY.MOVIE.EVER My #1 choice for suspense and just plain old scary stuff. Very well developed story will plenty of haunting scenes. All the characters are perfect for their roles. Just when you think the movie is over, its not. So the question is, is Samara evil or just a vengeful soul wanting to stream herself through your TV. 
I really love this movie and how the main character Rachel and Noah undercover the past behind the tape. I actually found this movie preety creepy, a rare occurance for me. Overall, great fun, and entertaining!Quite amazing actually. Its a great film that chilled me to the bone with its creepy atmosphere, disturbing imagery, and great twist ending. Overall I would recommend the ring to any horror fan no matter how casual of a horror fan they may be. A true classic of Japanese horror adaptations. Gore Verbinski expertly translates the themes of the Japanese film that preceded it and created a memorable movie with a false resolution that has left its mark on horror in America. I recommend this as one of the pinnacle movie adaptations of a Japanese horror film.The Ring is highly Americanized from the original Ringu, but offers an extremely unsettling experience mixed with an interesting investigation story that sees Naomi Watts at the top of her game.Terrifying take on the equally terrifying Japanese horror movie 'Ringu'. Naomi Watts did great in this movie and I was left shaking after I watched it. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat. The dreadful feeling you get from watching this movie adds to the suspense. I found that when the tape is being played I felt like it was something that I shouldn't have been watching, I had an urge to look away. Perfectly constructed movie. One of the scariest movies I've ever seen."
144,YPV_Doc4_TheRing,YPV,Horror,Positive,The Ring,"Naomi is the blood and dust of the investigation, she found God along the road, a ghost seems like a joke, now The Ring Gore Verbinski, the director, I suppose was never looking to create a pop culture storm. And he did. I mean I was too little to understand the cultural impact it had. But it certainly traveled to me even decades and way too much distance later. And I think that he wasn't looking for a response as such for the film barely feels commercial. It is also not a horror. You have to go through that staggering final act and right after the credit starts rolling you realize the harrowing nature of the film and why it so boldly claims to be of that genre. For the film, the script in its structure is a good gripping story about a thorough investigation done right. Also along with that, the film has a short film in the storyline that she, Naomi, has to decode which I loved the most. Naomi Watts tries to understand the art form with clues spread across this art house short film. That's the premise. That's the film. And with a countdown ticking at the back of their and our head the film uses those elements as tools to increase the pace of the film. I saw it with my father and all he wanted to know, always was what day it was. The Ring is a sensational horror film primarily for it doesn't treat itself and its audience like the way it is endorsed. There are no cheap setups, no loud screams and no bourgeois schemes installed separately to scare us an excuse or definition of boasting that ""This is a horror."" Another aspect of the film is mythology, so malleable that it throws you out convincing you that it is not mythical. This juggling has you as a ball and you're going to have a time of your life, figuring out what happens at the end of the day. Seventh day. The Ring is definitely the scariest horror movie of 2002, and definitely one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. It's got a gripping, non-stop, spooky feeling to it, from beginning to end, it's a very sombre and atmospheric flick. The best part is the slow discovery of the origins of the tape and the backstories. Recommended !! With resplendent atmospheric scenery and profoundly beautiful music, The Ring gets under your skin, thanks to its creeping sense of skin-crawling dread, quietly soothing storytelling and a lot of bone-chilling makeup effects -- thus setting the standard for Asian horror remakes and proving a silly storyline can be transformed into a riveting nightmare.This is better than the original, to my surprise. Its still not very scary but there a couple good scares. Samara coming out of the TV is still freaky as hell. The acting is ok at best, nothing stands out from the direction or cinematography, hence this movie could have been a lot better. Again I would mark this as a mystery and suspense with horror elements, rather than straight horror."
145,YPV_Doc5_TheRing,YPV,Horror,Positive,The Ring,"I don't want to see this movie ever again. This film is so scary, so frightening, so outstandingly horrific, that you'll only want to see it 3 times at most before letting it slip away into nostalgia and vague memories. So many good movies like ""The Ring"" are like that. Ghost stories are often better for memory than precise attention and ""The Ring"" won't be a barrier instead of a work of art, especially if we only remember it a little. Why has this movie been hated by the public at large? What makes people tick on this one? It's quite simple: there's a little girl. She's in some pictures for the movie and I won't spoil you with too much detail. A little girl becomes a ghost who haunts people through a modern curse; we look at the girl and become fascinated by her until we realize we're also horrified, and as we're coming to grips with the little girl, we want to love her; however, by loving her, we also deny the evil which persists in her, and people die because of her, so our sympathy and anxiety over her story just damage our imagination needed for survival and defense in our own lives as bad guys are talked about in the news with the world we live in. That's the horror. A little girl goes beyond death and enters her dimensions within spiritual means of deception and murder. She's totally playing with her victims and she smiles to pretend at her goodness. We don't want to hate a little girl and a completely evil ghost like her makes us squeamish and unreliable to her and ourselves. Only see this movie again if you've totally forgotten about it. Vague memories, remote possibilities, near chances, will prove or disprove one's trust for this girl. A little girl like her is like Miss Muffet only that she'd frighten the spider away rather than herself. Ever since I saw this movie years ago I've gotten nervous from time to time when I see objects that look like her (broom, office chair, flashing beams of light, etc.). Normally I don't hate children, but in this case, I believe it's completely healthy, and right, to trust this little girl less and less as she rises from the dead only to prove the notion of time when given its dark flavor of revenge. She has revenge against people who have nothing to do with her. How evil is that? All because of the strange family she lived in during her mortal existence on Earth she has hurt and destroyed innocent victims. We can't have sympathy for her! Evil speaks during her life and continues speaking after she dies and she just simply can't really pass ""away"". And I do pity her on different aspects- hair, dress, shoes, gentle voice... the ""evil"" here is misleading me into appreciation when she deserves none of it and needs a permanent shutdown. Pretty decent film. The last bit in particular scared me watching a ghost girl come out of a TV to kill the guy who watched the tape. And I don't normally get scared by horror films. The thing that I really found interesting about The Ring was how clever the story is and I was wondering all the way through ""How did this happen"" until we find it all out towards the end. The acting itself is all around pretty good and I think the director did a good job and I'm glad I watched this film. If you like horror films then The Ring is one of the films I would recommend"
146,YPV_Doc6_TheRing,YPV,Horror,Negative,The Ring,"Good thing I haven't bought this movie from amazon, because I hate this movie now. I notice that alot of people say this is scary, but it's not. I found it pretty boring and pointless. The story is that if you watch a certain video tape, you will die in seven days. What a dumb idea. How was the tape made? Why was it made? Why would a ghost be using a tape to kill people for no apparent reason? Suddenly, the ghost becomes evil at the end and kills the main character's boyfriend. Then the main character decides to make more copies of the tape! Why? The acting wasn't bad, but that doesn't help really. I recommmend these movies: John Carpentar's The Thing, They Live, The Fog, In The Mouth of Madness, Nightmare on Elm Street, Hellraiser. Those are really great horror/science fiction movies. People have forgotten what a great horror movie is because they're too used to those stupid teenybopper comedies and now they're coming out with these teenybopper horror movies that will probably only scare little 12 year old middle school punks and people who are shocked really easily.
Whenever this movie first came out, all of my friends were telling me how it was one of the scariest movies ever. I thought I needed to see it, also. However, when I watched it, I kept on waiting for a scary part. That scary part never came. This movie sucked. The only thing remotely scary about it was the videotape that the people watched.
Not only was this movie not scary, but it was a complete waste of my time. The plot was not one that held my interest at all. And the parts where the girl would call them up on the phone? Give me a break.
Another thing that bothered me was how the victims died. They looked at the little girl through the T.V. and died. That's right, all they had to do was look at her, and they died. If you ask me, that's a pretty nice and peaceful way to die. I would keep the videotape untill I was old. Then I'd pop it in and seven days later, I die a good death. The movie would be a lot better if the girl would have came out of the T.V. and mutilated the people instead but no, that's too much voilence for the pussy society of today.
You should skip this movie if your wanting to get scared and actually watch a real disturbing movie, like the Exorcist. Or perhaps read some Stephen King novels. Just don't expect too much from The Ring.
Much like Minority Report, The Ring is replete with plot holes and possesses a gibbering mess of a storyline.
It is yet another example of the film industry's decline and I am disappointed with it.
M. Night Shyamalen (Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs) seems to be the only director capable of making a first class thriller these days."""
147,YPV_Doc7_TheRing,YPV,Horror,Negative,The Ring,"Where shall we begin? As a lifelong and avid fan of genre films, this has to be one of the most overrated and disappointing movies I have ever seen. I'm not a horror film elitist, all I ask for is a decent story and at least a few scares or squirms. To summarize:
1. Naomi Watts-superb actor, she can do (and has done) so much better than this (Mulholland Dr., anyone?).

2. Plot & story-where are they? So full of holes you could drain pasta with it (do any screenwriters actually work in Hollywood any longer? or have they all given up and left the writing duties to the mailroom staff?). This is VERY puerile stuff here, adults beware.
3. Scare factor: on a scale of 1-10, ZERO. 0 suspense, 0 surprises, 0 credibility, and especially, 0 horror. This film simply is not scary, not at all, never for a moment.
4. Mama always told me: never put anything down unless you can come up with a better solution. SO--here are some recommendations for smart, interesting, intelligent, well-written and especially FRIGHTENING genre/horror films:
*The Devil's Backbone (Guillermo Del Toro): now THIS is scary!
*Don't Look Now (Nicolas Roeg): the most haunting, beautifully-shot (in Venice) and erotic horror film ever made. Just try to forget this one.
*The Hills Have Eyes (Wes Craven): visionary and still shocking.
*The Haunting (Robert Wise--the original, not the ridiculous modern remake): the best and most frightening ghost story EVER, period.
*The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Tobe Hooper): unrelenting, claustrophobic, sweat-inducing and repulsive. This is an iconic and endlessly-imitated masterpiece, right up there with George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead."" The recent remake (if not compared directly to the original) is NOT BAD, actually....

*The Mothman Prophecies (Mark Pellington): YUP, believe it or not, this is a tight, though confusing (you absolutely must read the book by John Keel prior to seeing this film) and above all VERY frightening and unsettling bit of business. Highly recommended for those looking for something different and a bit.....off.
*Repulsion (Roman Polanski): The granddaddy....if this one doesn't disturb you on a very deep and lasting level, I would worry. ""Rosemary's Baby,"" also Polanski, is another winner and timeless classic. Actually, ANYTHING Polanski is better than most of what's out there. I would like to know who made this....crap?? Is this a movie?? There is no plot and i wasted 2 hours of my life watching it. It is not even worth 5 dollars for renting it, don't waste your time watching a movie ABOUT a stupid movie...When you have to start making horror movies about horror movies then you really need to stop...anyone who thinks this movie is good must of seen the wrong movie..horrible acting...horrible plot...dont't watch it for even 2 seconds, you'll be confused for the rest of your life (i still am trying to figure out the bunch of meaningless ideas the directors threw in at the end fit in with the movie)
My humble opinion: check out the movies listed above and avoid ""The Ring""--annoying, unnecessarily oblique, and just plain dumb-dumb. Avoid."
148,YPV_Doc8_TheRing,YPV,Horror,Negative,The Ring,"Dear God,
Please deliber me from ever seeing movies like ""The Rink"" again. Ok, pretend it's 1982. John Carpenter's mood masterpiece ""The Thing"" is released upon the movie going public. It is, without a doubt, one of the greatest horror films ever released. What do the critics have to say? Well, they HATED it. The end leaves you without closure as to whether or not the Thing survived and may or may not take over the planet. What does this have to do with The Ring?...Well, the critics resounding LOVE for this [item], mainly.
Not only does The Ring not have a definate ending, but aside from the first ten minutes of the film, it has no definate ANYTHING. The plot is a complete mess. It starts off sounding like a pretty great movie. There's a cursed tape, kills you within a week of watching it, and the first ten minutes takes this fantastic premise and uses it to scare the heck out of the viewer. I kept expecting to see more scenes like that, but instead the movie jumps back and forth between completely nonsensical and unrelated plots. There's something about an infertile mother and diseased horses...I mean, I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but I know that this movie never explains ANY of these stupid little subplots which fill the following hour and twenty and minutes.
What do the critics have to say about this film? This film which has about twelve different plotlines and never explains what one has to do with the other? ""The best movie since The Exorcist!!!""? Jeezus...Maybe they mean Exorcist II: The Heretic, but The Exorcist I watched was a landmark movie which was actually scary and at the same time, made perfect sense. It also presented a great question about human psychology throughout the ages and about what we MIGHT be capable of with that 90% of our brains which we never use, or what evils we might be susceptible to. ""The Ring"" presents you with nothing. No questions except just what exactly the HELL you just paid seven dollars to sit through.
I'm a horror fan. I've sat through some strange stuff over the years, and not all of it made perfect sense. Videodrome, for example. Not EVERYTHING in Videodrome makes perfect sense, but in it, you're seeing things through the eyes of a man who is slowly losing his grip on reality, and a reality which is slowly losing it's grip on the TV addicted human race. So even though not everything is explained, it doesn't need to be. It takes place in a world gone mad. Or Phantasm...You're seeing things in sort of a dream-state. The Ring gives the viewer no such luxuries to its driveling incoherent storyline. The simple fact is, whoever adapted it from ""Ringu"" for American audiences was just an idiot. He clearly believes that audiences won't know the difference between a plot that has a narrative, sequential story, and a movie like the Ring that has no plot. Apparently he was right. This is one of the highest grossing horror films, which saddens me. This movie is so overated and i believed the hype......so i went out and bought a copy of the ring for $15 bucks this movie sucked big time it had a very boring story and dragged on forever.......people who say this is scary are really people that should grow up because this is the dumbest horror movie ever made...........The Ring 2 will be dumber of course it will.............the only reason this movie was popular was because of the mass teeny bopper media that dragged alongside it this movie sucked bad!!!...........i want to go see the Grudge from the trailer it looked good......but then they said it was the producers from the ring and then i gave up hope...............The ring sucks ass boring not scary overated Hollywood mumbo jumbo crap don't get this movie its just that bad"
149,YPV_Doc9_TheRing,YPV,Horror,Negative,The Ring,"Right at the beginning you're forced into excepting a fairly outrageous premise from this movie. People who watch a video tape die within seven days of viewing it. Ok, pretty dumb premise, but I've seen worse. I've got an open mind. Especially whens it comes to horror movies. Next, great image of a girl who gets scared to death. Very chilling. Very cool. Now we get to see what's on the tape. Extremely gothic images in jump cut. Wow, fantastic production values. Now, I'm intrigued. I think, we may be in for something special. But, instead I'm taken on an investigation into the history of a little girl who's making all this happen. How? Why? What? Why did the horse jump off the boat? Why did this girl get killed? Her father doesn't want her and that gives Mommy Dearest the impetus to kill her? Huh? The little girl is making videos with her ghostly mind to kill people? What for? Revenge? Against who?...........Against me for watching this movie all the way through. Who cares? I didn't. But if I was bankrolling this, I'd sure be asking these questions. But it just shows to go ya, Hollywood can lay any kind of pooh pooh and people will pay to see it. I know I did. And over 500 people reviewed it. Now, if I can just stop one person from seeing this.....
Hollywood justs seems to be sinking deeper and deeper with this genre. Whomever wrote this Screenplay should be forced to watch their own creation over and over, eyeballs open, ala Clockwork Orange, for eternity. That would be worse than what happened to the characters who watched the fatal tape in this movie. Oops, I called it a movie. Sorry. What really insulted my intelligence was the pretension of the film makers. Too much Drama going nowhere. If you got no story, bombard me with special effects. I can take it. Did anyone else notice VIDEODROME?
Even though flicks in this genre hardly ever have one, a decent payoff is in order. Beware!! This one has the worst denouement in recent memory. Don't Actors and Producers read scripts anymore?
Gets one star for the deadly gothic video tape. The rest is a waste. See FRAILTY instead. It's one of the best to come out in the genre in a long while.
THIS made NO sense. And I was smoking loads.
BAD DOG, I mean, HORROR MOVIE!! BAD!! This movie sucked! sucked! sucked! Aside from the creepy subliminal images it was nothing. I didn't get the plot, because there wasn't one. I mean where did the girl come from? Was she something the ""voodoo"" doctor cooked up on her parents trip they took to try and have a baby? I mean she evidently wasn't theirs because she came back like 9 years old. I thought the story was through in the end when they got her body from the well, it should have been, but alas, the story went on to her boyfriend getting killed by Samara. Somebody please tell me the reason for this little girl doing the things she did and where did she come from and what was the motivation for this dumb movie. I mean even in the ""short story"" the had on the extras on the DVD it still told you nothing about the story, it just showed clips from the film like you were suppose to get it. I mean how can you get that if you didn't even get the movie. I would have given it no stars but you have to put something in. I'm sorry but this movie was a waste, I'm glad I only rented it from the movie rental store."
150,YPV_Doc10_TheRing,YPV,Horror,Negative,The Ring,"I have never really liked horror movies much, and so I sat here at the computer, wonderered if I should give a review to this movie, fearful that I might have been intrinsically biased to give it a bad review. Well, after setting my qualms about horror aside, I'm giving it a bad review anyway.
I knew this movie was going to be a bad one from the first snippets of dialogue: two teenage girls talking about Your Most Basic Outcast Teenager Stuff, and then the small talk is eschewed in the clunkiest manner possible when one suddenly tells the other about a videotape that kills the viewer one week after he/she watches it. Ugh. And uh-oh, one of the girls watched it seven days ago. She dies, and her friend ends up in an psychiatric ward.
Enter the heroine, an investigative reporter for a Seattle newspaper, played by Naomi Watts. She's the aunt of the opening scene's victim. She comes across the tape and watches it, and learns that she has seven days left.
This part was actually intriguing to me, because I thought the movie was going to break free of the horror movie cliches it was in danger of getting bogged down into. At this point it's more of a thriller; a race against time. Title cards coveniently fade in, reminding us how long she has before she dies. To add to the excitment, her son watches the tape--now she's not just fighting for her own life but his, too.
The biggest problem with the movie was that it almost seemed to want to be another ""Sixth Sense"" by providing a twist and then giving a back story after the fact saying ""See, here's why there's a twist and why the movie doesn't end the way you think it does."" There is even a review on the box of the DVD stating that it is the best scary movie since ""The Sixth Sense"". Nice try, but this movie isn't a tenth of what that one is.
The twist itself wasn't the problem--in fact, I kind of liked it and thought that after it was established that yes, this was the way things were REALLY going to work out, the movie would have ended on a stronger note without any explanation. Instead, as before mentioned, more scenes take place that might interest some people who like all their stories tied up with a bow, but just left me thinking ""This movie's STILL not over?"" The Ring is boring. Why so many people say it's scary is beyond me. The so-called ""investigation"" was pointless, and it still didn't explain anything about why the deaths were occuring. The plot was needlessly slow and the mildly ""scary"" parts were too few and far in between. It's rated PG-13, how scary and disturbing could it be? Creepy music and spooky scenery just doesn't do it for me. I'm very disappointed.
As far as the ""extras"" on the dvd goes, they're pretty week, it's just a collection of edited scenes and non-sensical images."
151,DYZ_Doc1_RedNotice,DYZ,Comedy,Negative,Red Notice,"There’s a stinging form of déjà vu that can sweep over you when you’re watching a movie that feels like you’ve seen it before. Red Notice is so full of such moments that by the end, my skin was crawling. There’s turn off your brain and enjoy movies, and then there’s this. And no, its three ultra-famous headliners can’t rescue it from horrid mediocrity.
Written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, Red Notice is less a movie and more a frenzied splattering of cliches, snatched from a barrage of action, espionage, and heist films. Your brain might notice some familiar fight staging, a half-remembered plot point, or the whistling of the Indiana Jones theme. Sadly, all these inspirations come from far superior movies, so watching this one feels like watching Blue Clue’s, where the hints are so pronounced that you might well pull an overeager Leonard DiCaprio meme.
For starters, Dwayne Johnson swaggers onscreen playing a role we’ve seen him in plenty of times before: A no-nonsense cop forced to work hand-in-hand with a criminal that he high-key despises. Enter Ryan Reynolds, playing a part that feels like Deadpool drained of all his profane wit and left with quips like, “Why are you wearing the hairnet? You’re bald?” Finally, in swans Gal Gadot in glamorous Carmen Sandiego red attire, playing a thieving femme fatale, who can’t hold a candle to Fast and Furious’s Gisele.
The specifics are these: FBI agent John Hartley (Johnson) is out to bust the world’s two rival art thieves: wise-cracking Nolan Booth (Reynolds) and less-wise cracking The Bishop (Gadot), who drops punchlines with no punch like “I also know your browser history.” (Remember when that joke was fresh? Then congrats, you too are old.)
 There’s turn off your brain and enjoy movies, and then there’s this.
After a sleek switcheroo, Hartley’s good name is ruined as he’s framed for being in cahoots with Booth. To rescue his reputation, the pair will team up — through prison breaks, car chases, jungle runs, and a faceoff with a rampaging bull — to best The Bishop by stealing a long-lost artifact out from under her. In theory, this path is full of twists and turns. However, Thurber is coloring within the lines of convention, so all of it is infuriatingly predictable. The whole time I was anticipating every double-cross and secret reveal. So, yeah, it’s like watching a kids’ show and just wishing they’d solve the damn puzzle already.
Perhaps Thurber thought he could mask these telegraphed twists by the sheer amount of exposition dumping, made up of way too many details about the characters’ childhoods, the tedious history of the fictional artifacts, and maniacal monologuing that’s best suited to Bond villains. Or perhaps Thurber thought razzle-dazzle might be a good distraction?
I’m sure on paper all the action set pieces I glazed over above seemed exciting, as did the promise of a sultry tango scene between Johnson and Gadot. But all of the above is lacking. For instance, the dance scene is meant to tease a sexual tension between the good cop and the bad girl. However, Johnson has built his entire movie-star persona on being tough-as-nails but approachable. So when he attempts snarly smolder, it feels achingly stiff. Gadot is smirking and swiveling her hips, but there’s no spark between them, so this arc falls spectacularly flat.
Also floundering is Gadot’s attempts at landing punchlines. Sure, she’s gotten some laughs in Wonder Woman, but while playing a wide-eyed fish-out-of-water, winsomely enchanted by babies and ice cream. Here, balancing sultry and sophisticated with zingers that don’t zing, she’s out of step. But she’s not alone. Johnson and Reynolds also struggle to make something out of Thurber’s insipid script, which forces the Deadpool star to re-enact the Marvel misfit's meta-commentary schitck with lines like “Sneak past the featured extras and into the bedroom” and “Look for a box that says MacGuffin!”
No wonder he seems on cruise control. Reynolds is basically plagiarizing himself. And Johnson matches his enthusiasm (or lack thereof.)
Worse though are the action sequences. Part of the problem is CGI that is simply subpar. There’s too stark a difference between real-life sets and their human actors and the rubbery CGI of a fake crumbling wall and animated Reynolds and Johnson tumbling out of it. Quick cuts might hide some seams between practical stunts and CGI, but it won’t save a bad edit.
 Reynolds is basically plagiarizing himself.
Early on in Reynold’s first escape scene, there’s a glaring error in an attempted match-on-action edit. This means when the camera moves from a wide shot to a closer shot, cutting through a moment of action so that it appears seamless. When it’s done wrong, the action looks stuttered as it does here. Beyond scratching at audience awareness of a movie’s artifice, it also compromises the collaborative performance between stunt man and star. So, what should be a scene where it seems Booth is getting out by the skin of his teeth feels like he’s toying with the hapless security guards in pursuit. It shifts the stakes, and not in a way that benefits the suspense of the scene.
This is really a shame because it seems like this sequence — and Booth’s overall stunt physicality — is meant as an homage to Jackie Chan. Sure, Reynolds (and his stunt double) don’t have the masterful moves of this living legend. But in Booth’s frenzied physicality, there’s a fun sense of Chan’s brand of action, where it felt like anything could happen and ANYTHING could be an improvised weapon. But again, Red Notice makes these gestures without their bravado and creativity. So, you might notice the nods to Indiana Jones, James Bond, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, or even Michael Bay’s high-gloss, high saturated color aesthetic. But then you’ll be left wishing you’d just watched those instead."
152,DYZ_Doc2_RedNotice,DYZ,Comedy,Negative,Red Notice,"Three of the biggest movie stars in the world converge for one big action-adventure spectacular, enlivened by (reported) $20 million paychecks and the rare thrill of playing around with fellow titans. That setup makes the new film Red Notice (Netflix, November 12) sound like some project from the late 1990s, before IP became the selling point and actors more incidental. But it is indeed a film from and for the here and now. In that, Red Notice serves as a reminder that, well, they just don’t make them like they used to.
The stars in question are Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds, and Gal Gadot, all actors from the franchise world. The experiment of Rawson Marshall Thurber’s film is to see if their respective styles can meld together into something that may kick off yet another franchise. It’s an experiment that Netflix reportedly spent $200 million to run.
Alas, Red Notice is limp and dull, and does more to showcase the shortcomings of each of its marquee idols than it does to highlight their bankable charisma. A globe-trotting heist film that heavily relies on zippy banter, Red Notice never finds its groove, instead jerking around between familiar action sequences and humor that never lands.
Johnson plays FBI profiler John Hartley, who’s tasked with preventing the theft of a priceless golden egg made by Marc Antony for his doomed love, Cleopatra. Hartley fails when the world’s greatest art thief, Reynolds’s Nolan Booth, absconds with the thing. There’s another, perhaps better thief in the mix as well: Gadot’s The Bishop. And, as it turns out, there are a total of three missing eggs that need collecting. These objects don’t have any magical, Ark of the Covenant-esque properties, but the Indiana Jones movies are nonetheless referenced in Red Notice, both in a Nazi-loot plotline and by Reynolds whistling a bit of John Williams’s theme music. Red Notice would be better off not reminding us of far better things.
It’s fitting that Reynolds should be the one to do the referencing—as his character nods to lots of other old things, like Pulp Fiction and the way Borat says ""nice."" These irksome little non-jokes (Remember that thing??) aptly represent Reynolds’s grating performance, a schtick that’s seriously diminished in charm since Reynolds first trotted it out over 20 years ago. It feels lazy, like Reynolds is coasting on his Deadpool clout.
Johnson, once again playing the swaggering but gentle hulk, fares a bit better, because he is generally a more winsome performer. But there’s still a halfhearted drag to his work here. Nothing in Marshall Thurber’s script helps Johnson, or anyone else, rise to the occasion.
Gadot mostly just has to slink and sass and be smarter than the boys, doing a more wicked, but empty, riff on Diana Prince’s cool proficiency. She has discernible chemistry with neither Johnson nor Reynolds, who also have none with each another. Yet the movie is constantly telegraphing that we’re watching two icons bouncing off of one another, with surely dazzling results. Red Notice makes no effort to distinguish the characters that the actors are playing; it merely says, Look! They’re in the same movie!
The film’s grim insistence that we are witnessing some seismic movie star coming-together makes one fret, a little, about the future of film iconography. Then again, available right now on Netflix (and, according to some early viewer data, playing like gangbusters there) is the gloriously invigorating Western The Harder They Fall. That film is loaded with starry swagger, its various heists and showdowns given effervescence by an ensemble of terrific, name-brand actors. Sure, that cast can’t quite match the collective box office numbers of Johnson, Reynolds, and Gadot. But maybe they should be given the chance to try—while the members of the $20 million club go learn some badly needed new tricks."
153,DYZ_Doc3_RedNotice,DYZ,Comedy,Negative,Red Notice,"For decades, the easiest way to determine whether a blockbuster was a success for its studio was by looking at the box office receipts: The more money the movie made, the better chance it would provide a strong return on investment. But it’s a bit trickier to deduce whether a blockbuster has met expectations when the project isn’t coming from a studio, but rather a streaming company. Ever since the 2017 release of Bright—a bonkers movie that its star Will Smith pitched as Training Day meets Lord of the Rings—Netflix has dabbled in making its own blockbusters, to mixed results. For every stinker like Bright or 6 Underground, there’s been a relative hit like Extraction or Army of the Dead, which might not end up on a critics’ year-end list but certainly clears the bar of “watchable enough that a Netflix subscriber shouldn’t be flipping through their phone during most of its running time.”
In theory, viewing numbers for a movie would be the streaming equivalent of a box office haul. But setting aside the fact that Netflix’s viewership metrics are both shrouded in secrecy and self-reported—and therefore should be taken with an ocean’s worth of salt—it appears the company cares about quality to go with its quantity. Despite Netflix’s claim that 6 Underground—Michael Bay’s explosive(ly stupid) interpretation of the Mission: Impossible franchise—was one of the most-watched original movies in the streamer’s history, the company won’t pursue a sequel because it felt the film was a letdown creatively. (The decision is a bit more puzzling considering that Bright, by all accounts a film with as lowly a reputation as 6 Underground, will move forward with a sequel.)
Netflix’s decision-making remains hard to discern from the outside looking in, but the streamer has nevertheless become something of a refuge for a type of film that’s been increasingly crowded out of the theatrical landscape: the non-IP blockbuster. The company’s latest buzzy and original tentpole, Red Notice, is indicative of this shift. As traditional studios double down on superhero franchises and other forms of recognizable IP, there’s even less room for original blockbusters. On the whole, studios are more comfortable wringing every last drop from properties that audiences are familiar with rather than run the risk of trying something new, which can explain how a project like Red Notice landed in Netflix’s lap.
Back in 2018, Red Notice, a globe-trotting action-adventure caper about rival art thieves and the FBI agent on their tail, was green-lit at Universal as the latest collaboration between writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber and Dwayne Johnson (see: Central Intelligence and Skyscraper). But Universal ultimately got cold feet about footing the bill, perhaps in part due to Skyscraper’s somewhat modest gross for the studio, which was particularly disappointing in North America. Instead, Red Notice was acquired by Netflix, where, with a budget that reportedly reached $200 million, it became the streamer’s most expensive movie to date.
It’s not the first time Netflix has scooped up a project a major studio balked at; films as far-ranging as The Cloverfield Paradox and The Irishman were both originally set up at Paramount. But Red Notice seems like one of the most transparent attempts yet by the streamer to combine the old-school philosophy of blockbuster filmmaking with the modern desire to kick-start a franchise to call its own.
In lieu of familiar IP to draw viewers in, Red Notice is banking on the star wattage of its three leads: Johnson, Ryan Reynolds, and Gal Gadot. The emphasis on movie stars over the contents of the story is exemplified by the film’s bare-bones (and objectively terrible) poster, which is just the trio posing in fancy attire. While the poster itself is half-assed, the intent behind it is clear. In essence, Red Notice is a throwback to the star-driven blockbusters that studios were rolling out before the turn of the century—when the biggest draw of The Running Man, Total Recall, or True Lies was simply the fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger was attached to them.
In Thurber’s hands, those actors lean on their respective strengths to be Red Notice’s biggest selling point. As art thief Nolan Booth, Reynolds stays in his usual lane as a wisecracking comic foil; Johnson plays FBI agent John Hartley, another in a long line of the actor’s oily portrayals of members of law enforcement; and Gadot’s character, a mysterious criminal mastermind known only as the Bishop, has enough similarities with her turn in the Fast & Furious franchise that it won’t be all that surprising if Red Notice is retroactively labeled a prequel. (As far as I’m aware, there isn’t a post-credits scene where the Bishop reveals that her real name is Gisele Yashar.)
It’s commendable that Netflix is willing to fork over the same amount of money that Marvel reportedly spent on Eternals for an original blockbuster like Red Notice. Despite all the anxiety around Netflix’s ascension being a threat to the theatrical experience, streaming services are doing the lion’s share of the work in keeping certain kinds of films alive. (See also: mid-budget dramas and romantic comedies.) But it’s one thing for Netflix to be a haven for non-IP tentpoles; it’s another for the streamer to make movies at this scale that are worth seeking out over the latest entry in the MCU.
Unfortunately, in spite of its price tag and star power, Red Notice falls more on the Bright and 6 Underground end of the Netflix blockbuster spectrum. There’s a cold, almost algorithmic quality to the film and its performances, to the extent that calling Red Notice an original conceit feels disingenuous. Red Notice cribs so liberally from classic action-adventure movies that, in the third act, Reynolds’s character begins humming the Indiana Jones theme before entering a secret Nazi bunker that contains stolen historical artifacts and bears a striking resemblance to the final resting place of the Ark of the Covenant. (Whatever the winking intent, the humming just makes the viewer wish they were watching an Indiana Jones movie.)
As for the humor, meta jokes from the man behind Deadpool about MacGuffins, his character fighting background extras, and Vin Diesel prove increasingly tiresome when Reynolds doesn’t have a capable sparring partner—at one point Johnson’s character is described, not inaccurately, as a “well-dressed wall.” Meanwhile, Gadot’s character has barely any screentime, which, given her shortcomings at playing anyone outside of Wonder Woman, was probably the best decision made in the movie. But in an era when movie stars are fading and franchises continue to dominate the theatrical landscape, it’s frustrating to see actors squander a golden opportunity in the spotlight by being devoid of their usual charisma, being woefully miscast, or sticking to their usual schtick to diminishing returns.
Red Notice does end by setting itself up as a potential franchise that could keep the trio’s globe-trotting adventures going, one extravagant art-related heist at a time. But given the mixed messages Netflix has sent by giving Bright a sequel while putting 6 Underground to rest, it remains to be seen what fate befalls the similarly disappointing Red Notice. In any case, Red Notice’s standing as the streamer’s most expensive film ever will be short-lived. Sometime next year, Netflix will debut The Gray Man, an action-thriller from the Russo Brothers that’s been likened to James Bond and reportedly has a price tag north of $200 million.
The Gray Man is similarly encouraging in that Netflix is spending a massive amount of money for a movie compared to James Bond when it’s difficult for any spy movies to be made with that budget that don’t actually star 007. But as Bright, 6 Underground, and now Red Notice have underlined, green-lighting original blockbusters is only half the battle. After all, if the streamer’s projects don’t live up to the movies they’re trying to emulate, audiences can simply seek out Lord of the Rings, Training Day, Mission: Impossible, or Raiders of the Lost Ark, rather than a bland facsimile of them. Until Netflix has more hits than misses with their blockbuster slate, the streamer needs to be put on notice. "
154,DYZ_Doc4_RedNotice,DYZ,Comedy,Negative,Red Notice,"Rawson Marshall Thurber’s “Red Notice” should work on paper. It’s got a charismatic cast sent globe-hopping to beautiful places on a treasure hunt straight out of an “Indiana Jones” movie. How could it go wrong? Well, for starters, Thurber and everyone involved forgot a little thing called personality. Rarely have I seen a movie that feels more processed by a machine, a product for a content algorithm instead of anything approaching artistic intent or even an honest desire to entertain. And while there have been quality blockbusters produced by the Hollywood machine for generations (I miss those days), it feels like we’re increasingly reaching the point where they are so calculated and programmed that the human element is completely drained from them, making them as disposable as a fast food cheeseburger. Worst of all, that “content” approach is pulling the life from stars who have shown so much of it in the past. When the poster for “Red Notice” was released, most people lamented its Photoshopped, bland nature. They didn’t realize how honestly it captured the movie.
Thurber, the director of “Central Intelligence” and “Skyscraper” (two movies I enjoyed enough on their own terms, for the record), reunites with his muse, Dwayne Johnson, who plays the FBI’s top profiler John Hartley. The film opens with an awkwardly inserted info dump about three coveted eggs that were once the property of Cleopatra. Only two have been discovered, making the missing golden egg into a Holy Grail for treasure hunters, including one of the world’s most notorious criminals Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds). In the film’s relatively effective opening sequence, Hartley catches Booth trying to steal one of the eggs, inadvertently tying the two for the rest of the film into a classic buddy comedy dynamic—the muscle guy and the fast talker. They battle the authorities, a few bad guys, and another criminal mastermind nicknamed The Bishop (Gal Gadot) as they bounce around the world, trying to obtain all three eggs and sell them to the highest bidder.
00:15 / 00:29
Films like “Raiders of the Lost Ark” and “National Treasure” were clear inspirations on “Red Notice” but to say this movies lacks the identity of great action/adventure movies would be an understatement. Thurber’s direction seems to have been simply to put Reynolds, Johnson, and Gadot on camera and allow their screen presence and familiar techniques to carry the story, and one can literally see the weight of that on their shoulders. Johnson has never been this wooden, unable to find the hero or everyman in a non-character. He needs to figure out what's next because he seems to be tired of parts like this one and he's too charismatic to convey tired for the next chapter of his career. Reynolds makes out a little better, but you can almost see him growing weary of his attempts at witty schtick as more of his attempts at humor thud than usual. It feels like everyone thought casting would be all it took to make “Red Notice” charming and then forgot to give their actors charming things to actually do. Oh, there’s a lot of running and a lot of banter, but it starts to blend into cinematic paste.
People have lamented the growing sensation that Netflix increasingly makes product that’s designed to be watched with a phone in your hand, and I’m not sure I’ve ever felt this more strongly than while watching “Red Notice.” Made for $200 million, none of that fortune was spent on anything that retains a human touch—it’s the iPhone app of action movies. Look up and see a beautiful person in a beautiful place running or shooting something—go back to your phone. While there are some truly goofy and yet somehow predictable twists, there’s almost no real story here, certainly not a memorable one. And the settings, while often gorgeous, somehow lack personality too. Even the title sounds like something grabbed out of an Action Movie Screenwriter program.
So much money, so much charm, so much movie, and yet it adds up to so very little. “Red Notice” is as disposable a movie as you’ll see this year, something that most Netflix subscribers will have trouble remembering exists weeks later. It sets up a potential franchise in its final scenes (because of course it does)—let’s hope everyone involved forgets about that too."
155,DYZ_Doc5_RedNotice,DYZ,Comedy,Positive,Red Notice,"“Red Notice,” Netflix’s newest action-comedy from writer/director Rawson Marshall Thurber, has three things going for it: Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Ryan Reynolds, and a $200 million budget. On paper, the film sounds like a surefire success — but then again, so did “Cats.” Luckily for fans of the leading actors and the action-comedy genre in general, “Red Notice” is no “Cats.” It’s not reaching the astronomical streaming numbers of “Squid Game” or creating much of a buzz on social media, but it’s not a horrific mess either. Fans of Johnson and Reynolds will be sure to enjoy “Red Notice,” if only to get their fix of both actors in between installments of their more well-known franchises.

Johnson plays John Hartley, an intelligent FBI profiler who locks up famed art thief Nolan Booth (Reynolds) only to end up framed for the same crime and thrown in a prison cell with Booth. It turns out both of them have been played by the Bishop (Gal Gadot), a femme fatale art thief bent on stealing all three of Cleopatra’s mythic golden eggs to sell on the black market. The ensuing cat-and-mouse game leads the characters to exotic locales like Bali, Rome, and Argentina, though these backdrops are not explored by the characters or even shown much on-screen beyond title cards announcing the location. Like the premise of rival thieves chasing after a ‘MacGuffin,’ the international settings featured in the film are just another box checked off of the generic-action-film BINGO card.

While the plot — reluctant partners teaming up to take down a common enemy — is nothing new, the chemistry and charisma of the film’s leading men make the tired setup feel fresh. In a particularly amusing scene, Reynolds loudly outs Johnson as a member of law enforcement in the middle of a Russian prison cafeteria, much to Johnson’s chagrin. After the two make a daring escape from prison, they’re grateful for a change of clothes — until Johnson finds out that all there is for him to wear is a sparkly sweater that says “Gotta Dance.” These and other moments where the two stars playfully antagonize each other are among the film’s more entertaining moments. Perhaps this should come as no surprise given Johnson’s past success playing the ‘straight man’ to an off-the-cuff partner.

The same cannot be said of the scenes they share with Gadot, who delivers a performance almost as wooden as her acting in the ill-received “Wonder Woman: 1984.” Most of Gadot’s time on screen is spent kicking, tripping, and otherwise incapacitating the men of “Red Notice” to get what she wants. Her character is able to outwit Hartley and Booth with minimal effort, whether intercepting a phone call from an INTERPOL Inspector or pretending to be the warden of the gulag they’re locked up in. As fun as it is to watch a female antagonist go toe-to-toe against two action heroes, overall, her character suffers from a lack of development beyond being able to fight. Booth and Hartley both have backstories about how their fathers led them into their respective career paths. The most we learn of Gadot’s “Bishop” comes from a twist revealed in the final minutes of the film, and even that fails to give any real insight into her motivations. If anything, Gadot’s character is less developed than Inspector Das, a minor character played by “Umbrella Academy” alum Ritu Arya.

Gadot’s performance aside, “Red Notice” is a passable film. Does it have complex characters? No. A compelling, original story? Not quite. Spectacular visuals? There are some decent shots, but nothing audiences haven’t seen before — and that’s fine. No one is watching “Red Notice” for the commentary on the human condition, the incredible plot, or the mind-blowing cinematography. They’re watching “Red Notice” to see their favorite actors play action-hero versions of themselves while delivering a few exhale-worthy jokes. Go in with that mindset, and you won’t be disappointed."
156,DYZ_Doc6_RedNotice,DYZ,Comedy,Negative,Red Notice,"Early in Netflix’s attempted heist blockbuster Red Notice, FBI agent Johnson Hartley (Dwayne Johnson) tracks wisecracking thief Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds) to the Museo Nazionale di Castel Sant’Angelo in Rome. Booth plans to swipe an 18-karat Egyptian egg, but the priceless artifact has already been stolen. Hartley proves it by pouring a can of Coke over the counterfeit egg on display. The lacquer of fake gold dissolves under the corrosive liquid, and the egg melts into rusted trash.
No scene in this lumbering action movie better exemplifies how hollow writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber’s Netflix film is. Featuring a trio of supposed movie stars who lack the panache or charisma of true marquee headliners, Red Notice is another visually ghastly bid at building a franchise on the back of action sequences that commit a cardinal sin for blockbuster thrillers. The sequences here that are supposed to carry the excitement aren’t just oddly cheap and ugly, they’re breathtakingly boring.
Like the National Treasure or Indiana Jones movies, Red Notice is propelled by the mythology of ancient artifacts and the greed they attract. According to this movie’s lore, more than 2,000 years ago, Roman general Mark Antony gifted his love, the Egyptian queen Cleopatra, with three golden eggs. After their joint death by suicide, the three tokens were scattered. One settled in the Museo Nazionale. Another is with a private collector. The third has been lost for centuries. An Egyptian billionaire wants to reunite the eggs for his daughter’s wedding, and is willing to pay big money to bring them together. Hartley very nearly foils the plot, until he’s framed as a thief by a mysterious criminal named The Bishop (Gal Gadot). He needs to find the three eggs and arrest Booth and Bishop if he wants to clear his name.
While Red Notice is meant to provide origin stories for these characters, their backgrounds are lackluster. Hartley and Booth turn out to have similarly tragic childhoods, stemming from terrible dads. But their long-winded summaries of their lives are so banal, they don’t supply any emotional branches for the audience to latch on to. Nor are they funny. The unlikely pair wind up tethered by a common cause, but Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier in The Defiant Ones they are not. As they confront the ruthless Bishop, who is maneuvering against them as a poorly rendered copy of Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct, their improbable partnership grates under a script filled with dreadful dialogue. (This is another film that uses the “We’re opposites, but we’re actually not all that different” trope.)
Thurber’s script cribs from a compendium of cinematic references to assemble the movie’s events. Everything about their meetings and interactions with Bishop, while avoiding a pursuing Interpol agent, Inspector Das (Ritu Arya), comes from a familiar visual language. A masquerade party finds Hartley and Bishop engaging in a tête-à-tête on the dance floor. Their bodies wrapped around each other, in the seductive motions of the tango, is meant to evoke the sensual power dynamics at the heart of True Lies. Between the Rock’s stiff muscular frame and Gadot’s stiffer face, it’s rendered as an asexual shadow of that film. Other references include The Third Man, Gladiator, Reservoir Dogs, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and so forth. Some of these odes are winking. Others are blasphemous inclusions in such a cinematically bankrupt film. Every reference only reminds savvy viewers what this movie isn’t.
On a craft level, nothing here has any spark. Cinematographer Markus Förderer (Independence Day: Resurgence) relies on widescreen, an aspect ratio that in theory befits a globetrotting heist flick. But Red Notice’s wide canvas is composed of cheap paint: The constant use of CGI backdrops results in vulgar brown-tinted lighting. The locations — Rome, Russia, London, Egypt, etc — are indistinguishable from each other. The compositions are equally unimaginative, leading to perplexing camera angles and nauseating camera movements during fights. The widescreen format is a tease that never translates to a bigger punch of action.
With Deadpool star Ryan Reynolds in the fold, along with Thurber’s comedy background — he directed Dodgeball and We’re the Millers — Red Notice’s comedic verve should be in the bag. But Reynolds falls into a familiar sarcastic persona, and Johnson and Gadot are poor partners for his improvisational antics. They just aren’t funny. Johnson can’t ping-pong Reynolds’ strained references to Instagram, iPhones, or deepfakes back to him. Gadot has zero comic timing. The height of Red Notice’s comedy is Johnson being rammed by a CGI bull in the middle of a coliseum, only because, by that point, we side with the bull.
Neither the film, the script, nor the actors provide any reason to care about these characters or this plot. What does it matter if they attain all three eggs? The world isn’t on the verge of ending. No governments are being harmed. No one’s life is in danger. Instead, this film is merely an incoherent preamble, a jalopy star vehicle where quality is secondary to producing a franchise launching pad. The film eventually winds toward a legend involving Hitler’s art dealer, with a dreadfully shot car chase set underground, caked in hideous visual effects. The grand finale is so unlikely that the incomprehensible screenwriting logic necessary to sell it provides a coma-inducing whiplash.
Thurber wants to bank on the sex appeal of Red Notice’s central trio, but putting such uninteresting actors at the center of the story is a huge turnoff. The film is meant to look and feel immense, but Steve Jablonsky’s cheap score and the film’s over-reliance on visual effects makes the entire project look oh-so-tiny. The recent Army of Thieves and Red Notice both raise the question of whether the executives greenlighting these movies at Netflix have any idea what makes for engaging tentpole cinema, or what it takes to craft stories that stick in viewers’ hearts so they return again and again, no matter what iteration a story takes. What Red Notice does prove is that the streamer is very good at spending lots of money on fool’s gold, only for the short-term shine to flake away when each new project finally goes on display. "
157,DYZ_Doc7_RedNotice,DYZ,Comedy,Positive,Red Notice,"Got to say this for Red Notice — it knows exactly what kind of a movie it is: a mashup of a classic caper tale and Indiana Jones that’s fully aware of how the star power involved will draw people in, and thus makes sure to put said stars (Ryan Reynolds, Dwayne Johnson, and Gal Gadot) front and center.
Director Rawson Marshall Thurber also makes sure that all 118 minutes of the film move along at a brisk pace, with plenty of action set-pieces, twists, and heist hijinks along the way. Things begin with notorious art thief Nolan Booth (Reynolds) attempting to steal one of the three legendary (and incredibly valuable) eggs of Cleopatra, with special agent John Hartley (Johnson) determined to track him down and stop him, building up to a globe-trotting adventure packed with legitimately laugh-out-loud moments of comedy.
There’s a notion that if it’s not a serious awards contender like The Power of the Dog or Passing, Netflix original films aren’t “real” films. But real talk, the vast majority of Red Notice‘s viewers will watch it on Netflix after a long day, appreciating the convenience of blockbuster-adjacent cinema being available in their homes. They’ll have a pretty nice time. Red Notice is not high art, but that’s not always what you need. Sometimes, what you need is two movie stars searching for lost treasure and making stuff explode.
Debunking Borat Teaser
To talk about this movie in general strokes means to reduce it down in ways that smother the fun out of it. So, instead, let’s break down all the reasons why Red Notice is far from the worst viewing choice out there, and might even be worth your time.
 
09. A Match Made In Blockbuster Heaven
There’s something that feels fated about pairing Johnson and Reynolds together in a film like this, as both actors have found a lot of similar success in buddy action films utilizing their specific personas — just with different partners. Johnson, of course, has suited up multiple times with Kevin Hart as his foil, while just this year Reynolds starred with Samuel L. Jackson in sequel film The Hitman’s Bodyguard’s Wife.
While both men have more than proven their abilities to lead a film solo, these team-ups let both actors lean into their sweet spots as movie stars: Johnson gets to play the heavy and lift heavy things, while Reynolds gets to sling around one-liners and play a more impish role.
08. There Are Lots of Tuxes and Exotic Locations
The world may be reopening to some degree right now, but the era of staying home in our sweatpants is not exactly a distant memory, and thus there’s still a vicarious thrill to be found in seeing beautiful people in beautiful locations wearing beautiful clothes. (Not all of these points are going to be extremely highbrow, to be clear.)
07. There’s a Really Good Jurassic Park Joke
In general, Thurber’s script features a lot of solid bits (including an already infamous Vin Diesel reference) but an extended runner about Jurassic Park being confused with a nature documentary is one of the film’s high points.
06. “Bubba” and “Baldilocks”
These are just two of the nicknames that Nolan uses for Hartley during this film. Great work, no notes.
05. “A Consulting Profiler Who Specializes in Art Crime”
That’s how Johnson’s special agent character is introduced, as a specialist in Art. Crime. Again, perfect choice.
04. Gal Gadot Is Having a Lot of Fun
Gadot as an actress is sometimes hard to get a read on, as her non-Wonder Woman work is relatively minimal, and her take on the Amazonian princess oftentimes leans hard into the character’s serious nature. Here, though, she embraces the role of a mysterious legendary thief with gusto and wit, perhaps the most relaxed and therefore the most charming she’s been on screen in some time.
Okay, there are no moments on the same ethereal level as Diana trying ice cream for the first time, but while she’s more of a supporting player in Red Notice than the advertising would lead you to believe, she’s a joy to watch.
03. This Might Be Dwayne Johnson’s Best Film Romance Yet?
Without giving too much away, it’s worth noting that unlike other, more forced efforts to give Johnson a love interest in his film work (looking at you, Jungle Cruise), Red Notice features Johnson kissing another person in a way that actually feels believable and real. It’s not a big part of the story, but unlike other movies (sorry again, Jungle Cruise) this relationship works.
Okay, one mild spoiler: The person being kissed is not Reynolds, in case you had your hopes up. But the ending clearly sets up the potential for a sequel, so we all can live in hope for the future.
02. There’s At Least One Truly Hilarious Cameo
The final act of Red Notice features an appearance by a well-known musical artist, one who at this point is becoming pretty notorious for making cameos (he even makes a reference to one of his previous cameos). Perhaps that’s why he does such a good job here at playing with his star persona in a non-musical context.
01. It’s Just Meta Enough to Work
Thurber’s filmography is full of surprises — who would have ever predicted that the man who made his directorial debut with Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story would end up becoming a go-to director for one of the planet’s biggest action stars? And yet here we are.
What’s fun about Thurber is that because his background in comedy (including the wildly under-appreciated Ryan Hansen Solves Crimes on Television*) pushes projects like Red Notice just up to the edge of the line of parody without ever crossing over to the point where the drama feels meaningless.
Depending on your sense of humor, quips like “I don’t know, look for a box that says MacGuffin” might come off as a bit grating in the context of what might otherwise be considered a serious scene; but if you don’t mind your action comedies laced with a bit of meta, Red Notice is a treat.
"
158,DYZ_Doc8_RedNotice,DYZ,Comedy,Positive,Red Notice,"Red Notice is Ryan Reynolds at his Ryan Reynolds-iest, and he is the best thing about the proceedings. His Nolan Booth perfectly summarises the experience of the film — hilarious, fun, and lovably irreverent in the best possible way.
It is not easy getting the big, flashy, full-bodied blockbuster right. To infuse just the right amount of cheeky self-awareness with winning banter and explosive action, without ever diving into the ridiculous and getting away from itself. To offer an experience that entertains and engages without feeling hollow and soulless. But writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber (We're The Millers, Central Intelligence, Dodgeball) gets it.
The big action-comedy romp done right, on face value, Red Notice feels like a movie you have seen done badly a million times before. But I am glad to say that is certainly not the case here. Led by unnaturally good-looking people (Ryan Reynolds, Dwayne Johnson, and Gal Gadot), Red Notice is a  good old-fashioned, globetrotting, swashbuckling adventure that is part buddy-cop movie, part heist flick, and part Indiana Jones-style adventure. I would go as far as to say that, for those who are yet to venture back, it is the ideal movie to return to the big screen for. Ironic, given it is a Netflix-only release in India.
Reynolds is Nolan Booth, the world’s second greatest art thief. Hot on his trail is top FBI profiler John Hartley (Johnson), who has been tracking Booth around the world. But two steps ahead of both of them is the world’s top art thief known only as The Bishop (Gadot). When Hartley is framed for a crime he himself is investigating, he is forced to team up with Booth to take down the Bishop once and for all. 
Make no mistake, Red Notice breaks no new ground, but it is not particularly interested in doing so. Nor are any of the actors playing actual characters of any sort. Everyone is playing versions of themselves. This was always going to be an action movie that sails off the back of a clash of charisma between hot movie stars, giant action set pieces, and a slideshow of exotic locations, and it works wonderfully. 

Once again, The Rock is the serious-no-nonsense-brooding-intensity cop, and Reynolds is the quick-witted art thief with a mouth. The movie rests entirely on Reynold’s industrial-sized wit, charm, and one-liners meeting The Rock’s industrial-sized intensity and well... self. But their golden back and forth aside, Red Notice is a Ryan Reynolds show all the way. 
As you would expect, he gets all the best moments and quips. Typical Ryan-isms that only he could come up with. So much so that it seriously brings writer-director Thurber’s writing credit into question, at least in terms of the dialogue.
While the supernaturally gorgeous Gal Gadot’s mere presence lights up the screen, the same cannot be said for her hit-and-miss act which proves to be the weakest of the trio. Gadot’s Bishop works best in the ""teaching the bumbling boys how it’s done"" scenes in the early parts of the film, and is far less watchable later on when she goes full-blown campy 'villain.'
On the ass-kicking front, action is always a worry for movies like this where we have come to expect the frantic-disorienting-hyper-cutting-disorienting brand of fight sequences. But the action here proves far less choppy and cutty than the average assault-on-the-eyes blockbuster. What is more, the film also makes an admirable effort of blending comedy into the action. Whether it is the impressive long-take opening sequence that leads up to Nolan Booth’s playful introduction scene — where he pushes, kicks, and makes a fool of the police with the help of some scaffolding. Or even later on with a well-timed snowball during a Russian prison break sequence.
The proceedings do lose steam, however, towards the more tired last leg of the film. It also does not help that Ritu Arya as the Interpol agent trying to capture the trio proves to be little more than a convenient plot device who appears when the movie needs her to most. Still, these do not take away from the simple fact that I cannot remember the last time I enjoyed an action comedy this much.
Aside from offering everything you would want from a movie like this, Red Notice also manages to help break Netflix’s poor track record of event blockbusters (Bright, 6 Underground, Army Of The Dead). Despite its appearances, Red Notice is more than mere empty movie calories, it is deeply satisfying comfort food.
"
159,DYZ_Doc9_RedNotice,DYZ,Comedy,Positive,Red Notice,"It’s true that this new action crime film from Netflix doesn’t reinvent the wheel. While Red Notice isn’t the most impressive or unique of its genre, it still proves to be a satisfying and fun watch. The action sequences and fight scenes are well orchestrated, the performances are well executed, and there’s a nice twist that I didn’t see coming. Along with the action is comedy from Reynolds, he really gets to flex his comedic muscle here. I think most of the reviews on this have been too harsh. As long as you don’t go into this expecting a perfect ten, I think you’ll have a pretty good time.

The casting here is well done. Ryan Reynolds plays a wise cracking art thief and he’s practically made for this role. You can’t help but love him here. Dwayne Johnson plays a dedicated FBI agent who is framed and ends up having to work with Reynolds to catch the number one art thief in the world, Gal Gadot.

Johnson does well with these types of roles. He’s very convincing and he and Reynolds work well together in a good cop/bad cop situation. Gadot does very well with her role, too. She’s the perfect type of actress to play an alluring thief with secrets up her sleeve.
Having a talented amusing cast is a must with a fun crime action film such as Red Notice. The action sequences are pretty well orchestrated too, complete with some impressive stunts. The best action sequence takes place at the end with an exciting South American car chase. I also really liked the destinations, especially the snowy Russian prison. You just have to have scenic locations to match the mood with this kind of high octane film.

Red Notice has some nice comedy sprinkled in. Almost 100% of it falls in Reynolds’s lap and he delivers it with that slick sarcastic charm of his. What I liked most about this script though is the plot twist towards the end that caught me by surprise. As the film progressed, I did wonder if there would be any kind of a twist but I didn’t expect the one they served up. I found the twist to be a lot of fun and it actually paves the way for a sequel that I’d like to see.
Another positive is the direction by Rawson Marshall Thurber. The majority of the scenes have a nice polished look to them and all the action is well captured. One thing I can’t stand is poorly filmed action scenes.
The main drawback with Red Notice is that on several occasions it attempts to be sentimental and pull at heartstrings. These attempts are not successful and clash with the film’s overall tone, which is light hearted and fun. Luckily, there’s only a couple scenes that focus on that.

I do think they should have had one or two more looks over this just to punch it up a bit because there’s a lot of good here and with some little changes I think it could have been better. If Red Notice is available in a theater near you, I’d suggest just watching at home on Netflix. This serves as a decent showing from the comfort of your own home. I do hope we get a sequel that builds upon this one and works out some of the minor kinks.

Red Notice isn’t the best of its kind but it will do if you’re looking for a decent action crime film with a twist.
"
160,DYZ_Doc10_RedNotice,DYZ,Comedy,Positive,Red Notice,"Red Notice, the most expensive Netflix produced movie made, has gone some way to justifying its hefty price tag, as Ryan Reynolds shared the news that it has become the most-watched opening day movie on the platform.
There were a few raised eyebrows when it was leaked that the new Netflix movie Red Notice, which arrived on the platform on Friday and stars the A-List trio of Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds, cost upwards of $200 million to make, with around $60 million of that going straight to its three star names. However it looks like the price tag has been somewhat justified as the most expensive movie Netflix has ever produced has also gone on to become the biggest first day movie in the streamer's history. Ryan Reynolds shared the news via his always-busy Twitter account, while also taking a moment to have a little fun poke at Taylor Swift in the process.

""Wow, Red Notice is Netflix's biggest ever opening day for a film,"" the actor tweeted. ""Congrats to this whole team! Can't wait for Red Notice (Taylor's Version).""
Of course, singer and actress Taylor Swift, who is close friends with Reynolds and Blake Lively, has been releasing a number of ""Taylor's Version"" songs and albums recently, having re-recorded some of her earlier work. With one of these releases being the album Red, which broke the record for the most streamed album in a day on Spotify and made Swift the most streamed female in a day, Reynolds just couldn't help himself in making a joke based on the close proximity of the movie to the album.
When it comes to Red Notice, the film didn't gain overwhelmingly positive reviews from many critics, with most putting it in the category of ""generic action flick,"" but when it comes to the movies of Dwayne Johnson, most of his biggest hits could fall into that category with their formulaic approach, big stunts, action set pieces and a pretty linear storyline. There are not many people who enter one of The Rock's films with the expectation of seeing Hamlet, and that is both why they prove so popular and keep audiences coming back for more. There is an expectation of two hours of escapism that comes with most of his output, where someone can leap from a crumbling building, grab onto a passing helicopter, swing through the window of another building and land a sucker punch on the bad guy without breaking a sweat. Sometimes, you just need to have something that defies logic and belief, and no one does that better than Johnson at his best.
So with the hard work seemingly done, Netflix will now be charting the movie's stats over the coming weeks and beyond before they can really tell if the epic budget equals an epic ""impact value"", which will determine the profitability of the project. While some studios are quick to give the green light to sequels when it comes to movies with their biggest stars in, Red Notice producer Dany Garcia said at the premiere that there was always a wait-and-see attitude to potential sequels.
""What we have planned is to let's see how this goes,"" Garcia told Variety. ""I think there is... with Seven Bucks Productions, it's almost like 'franchise' is just part of our conversation. But we're also smart enough to say, 'Let's see how everything goes.'""
So far it seems to be going pretty well, as despite the lowly 39% critics approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, Netflix viewers are loving the movie and it currently sits on an Audience Score of 92% Fresh, and after all, it is the audiences that bring in the money. Whether we will see Red Notice 2 in the future, which would have to first find time in the schedules of its busy leads, is something that will no doubt be discussed in the coming months.
"
161,MAS_Doc1_FrozenII,MAS,Comedy,Positive,Frozen II,"Parents, you can breathe a sigh of relief. Frozen 2’s new showstopper “Into the Unknown” isn’t as aggressive an earworm as “Let it Go”. It’s more lyrically complex, with a lot more high notes – the kind that’ll break your eardrums if sung by anyone who isn’t Idina Menzel – and it’s hard to imagine a car full of kids howling such a delicate scale for hours upon hours.
Frozen 2, Disney’s sequel to its $1.3bn hit, is more mature, ambitious, and intricate than its predecessor. That doesn’t automatically make it better – Frozen’s success was built on a simple and relatable story of sisterly love – but it’s different enough not to feel like a stale rerun. There are surprises here to uncover, and a renewed sense of energy to the proceedings. Admittedly, the film does play with fire by taking the same path as other sequels, padding out a character’s backstory in the hope it’ll add depth to their world. There are echoes of last month’s Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, as Queen Elsa (Menzel) is carted off to a magical place that might provide a few answers about where she comes from. But Frozen 2 succeeds where so many others have failed.
As the sentient snowman Olaf (Josh Gad) himself neatly summarises in one scene, Elsa made peace with her ice powers at the end of Frozen, when she discovered that the key to it all was love. Now, she rules over Arendelle, while Anna (Kristen Bell) and her boyfriend Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) provide a sense of domestic normalcy through weekly charade sessions.
That is, until a mysterious female voice (provided by Norwegian singer Aurora) pierces the quiet and shakes Elsa’s soul. Is someone out there looking for her? Does she have a greater purpose beyond the castle walls? Anyone hoping Disney is finally giving Elsa a girlfriend, by the way, will be sorely disappointed – her sexuality still remains purposefully obscure.
Instead, this alluring call draws Elsa into an enchanted forest that feels ripped straight from the pages of Norwegian mythology. There are giants, runes, and an indigenous tribe inspired by the Sámi people. Frozen 2 has an authenticity that immediately separates it from so many other subpar follow-ups. Its worldbuilding not only feels earned, but meaningful. Returning directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck ensure that every frame is exquisitely detailed and rich with colour: we move gracefully from autumn leaves to the pinkish glow of ethereal fire, then on to stormy, grey waves and shimmering ice crystals.
Certain sequences here are even more spectacular than the creation of Elsa’s ice castle, with the filmmakers now more confident to step out of reality and deliver something truly jaw-dropping. Lee’s screenplay, too, makes some bold choices. She teases out several compelling ideas: environmentalism, reparations, exploitation and how we should confront the past. It’s all vague enough that it could be applied to a hundred different real-world situations, which perhaps makes it all the more powerful as a learning tool for families.
But Frozen 2 doesn’t lose itself in rootless ambition. It works because we’re guided through these strange, unfamiliar surroundings by the steady hands of Elsa, Anna, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf – characters with whom we’re all very much familiar (or, for some parents, exhaustingly familiar) – and the cast sink straight back into their roles.
Elsa and Anna’s sense of sisterhood is tested, but ultimately prevails. Kristoff bumbles around with a ring in his pocket, wanting to propose to Anna but never quite finding the right time (he also happens to get what, in truth, might be the film’s best song – an Eighties power ballad accompanied by a chorus of crooning reindeer).
Olaf remains annoying to those who have always found him so, but those who appreciated his brand of existential humour will be amply rewarded. At one point, he casually shares his theory that “advancing technology will be our saviour and our doom”.
Frozen 2 may have grown up a little since 2013 – just as its fans have – but it never allows itself to lose sight of what made the original click: its warm heart and generous spirit."
162,MAS_Doc2_FrozenII,MAS,Comedy,Positive,Frozen II,"The alchemy that made “Frozen” such a monster hit can’t be easily replicated, and isn’t entirely in its six-years-later sequel. But “Frozen 2” delivers enough of what made the original hum to warm the hearts of a generation of tykes that have gobbled it up, while almost certainly adding happiness to Disney’s holidays.
To their credit, the filmmakers haven’t completely rested on their laurels, but for better and worse have bitten off a whole lot in terms of the story, which – set three years after the first movie – moves relationships forward while going back to address sins of the past. That includes dredging up Elsa and Anna’s family history, and the source of former’s fantastical powers.
There’s a bit of messiness in that, but fortunately, the movie has several not-so-secret weapons at its disposal, starting with the soaring instrument that is Idina Menzel’s singing voice as Elsa. While her new power ballad (one of two, really), “Into the Unknown,” doesn’t quite match the catchiness of “Let It Go,” songwriters Robert and Kristen Anderson-Lopez have presented their star with enough operatic highs to again send audiences out of the theater singing three little words, just not nearly as well as she does.
There is also some very funny stuff for Josh Gad as the snowman Olaf, who, in one applause-inducing sequence, breathlessly recaps the previous movie in one rat-a-tat burst. And of course, there’s the ongoing romance between Anna (Kristen Bell) and Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), the latter of whom actually gets to sing a whole song this time out, in a cleverly amusing boy-band spoof.
All that amounts to the side dishes around this Thanksgiving feast, with the entrée being the haunting voice that summons Elsa and her entourage into an enchanted forest, where the promise of unlocking the aforementioned secrets resides.
The film gets a little convoluted at that point, frankly, but it’s never less than fun – including a number of savvy references to the original, and jokes at its own expense – even if sisterly love triumphing over all loses something thanks to all the work that “Frozen” did toward establishing that notion.
The creative team remains the same – with Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee directing, and Lee receiving script credit based on a story attributed to multiple hands – and the visuals are not surprisingly stunning, including the frequently previewed sequence of Elsa seeking to use her ice-creating powers to cross a raging sea. As for the message, there’s actually one about indigenous peoples that adults should recognize more than the kids they’ll be squiring and/or chauffeuring.
Like the best Disney animation, “Frozen 2” effectively operates on multiple levels. And like any follow-up to a major hit, it comes burdened with expectations that are challenging to fulfill. (Incidentally, there’s a small post-credit scene as a reward for those who sit through the long roll of animators and production babies.)
Because the first movie generated such a bracing gust of enthusiasm, “Frozen 2” will inevitably be nitpicked and judged against those lofty standards. Still, there’s plenty to enjoy for those willing to chill out, and yes, let the past go."
163,MAS_Doc3_FrozenII,MAS,Comedy,Positive,Frozen II,"""Frozen II"" has an autumnal palette, with russet and gold setting the stage for an unexpectedly elegiac tone in the follow-up to one of Disney's most beloved animated features. Even the irrepressibly cheerful snowman Olaf (Josh Gad), now permafrosted so even the warmest hugs don't melt him, is worried about change as the leaves turn orange and float down from tree branches. He is confident, though, that as soon as he gets older he will understand everything. After all, that's what he expects from Elsa (Idina Menzel), Anna (Kristen Bell), and Kristoff (Jonathan Groff). Anna reassures him (in song, of course) that yes, some things change, but some things are forever. She tells him that even when you don't know the answers you can always just do the next right thing, and that will help. 
""Frozen II"" is funny, exciting, sad, romantic, and silly. It has great songs and a hilarious recap of the first movie, and then it is all of that all over again. Plus an extra scene ALL the way at the end of the credits. This sequel can seem overstuffed at times, and tries a bit too hard to replicate the magic of the first film, but it is impressively willing to engage with some complicated issues in a frank manner that is accessible to children and insightful even for adults. 
It throws a lot at us, like rock monsters, a cute fire salamander, and a magnificent water horse (the latter two likely to appear on holiday gift wish lists). The settings are gorgeously imagined and wonderfully inviting. Anna has a sensational new wardrobe. We learn family secrets, some comforting, some painful. Characters confront some of the most daunting human questions about loss, change, trust and how we can best heal the wounds of the past.
In a charming flashback, we see the princesses as little girls, playing together happily and being put to bed by loving parents. The king tells them a bedtime story from his own childhood about visiting an enchanted forest with his father to celebrate the completion of a dam the Arendellians built to help the indigenous people. But the gathering turned into an attack. The king was killed, and only the young prince survived, rescued by a mysterious character. Ever since, the enchanted forest has been barricaded by a powerful mist. The girls learn from their mother's lullaby that the river may hold some answers about what happened. ""Dive down deep into her sound, but not too deep or you'll be drowned,"" the Queen sings. ""When all is lost, then all is found."" It's surprising how dark lullabies can get, a character points out.
In the present day, the sisters live happily in the castle, enjoying family time (Olaf is the Charades MVP) and caring for their community. But Elsa hears voices calling to her from the enchanted forest. She is afraid, but also thrilled. It is an invitation she struggles to admit that she wants to accept, leading to this film's belter ballad, ""Into the Unknown."" ""I've had my adventure/I don't need something new ... don't you know there's part of me that loves to go into the unkn-ow-ow-own.""  
And so, after a warning from Kristoff's ""love expert"" friend Pabbie (Ciarán Hinds) and Olaf's not-always-helpful fun facts commentary along the way, they reach the enchanted forest. There, they meet new characters, sing some more songs, sort out some misunderstandings and try to protect each other. They confront the consequences of bad, even tragic choices made by their family. 
Parents often ask me why children, especially preschoolers and middle-schoolers, like to watch the same movies over and over. I tell them that when everything around you seems to be drastically changing on a daily basis and you barely know yourself anymore, it can be a great comfort to have a movie friend that's the same every time. ""Frozen II"" is destined to be one of those movies children will want to see dozens of times. It will reward repeat viewings with both its reassuring messages about responding to change with courage and curiosity, and its challenge to understand the mistakes of the past so we can begin to work on ""the next right thing"" together."
164,MAS_Doc4_FrozenII,MAS,Comedy,Positive,Frozen II,"Elsa, Anna and the gang return for another tale of princess empowerment and earworm soundtrack cuts. When the animated musical Frozen skated into the multiplex in 2013, it grossed a record-breaking $!.27 billion in cold cash. Let it go? Hell, no! Six years later, Disney delivers an uneven but sensationally entertaining sequel to the Oscar winner that pulls out all the stops. The songs, again by the award-winning couple of Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, are tantalizing earworms. The animation bursts with wonders — wait till you see what the CGI wizards do with water, the toughest element to animate. And it’s pleasure to re-connect with everyone’s favorite sister princesses: Elsa (belted by Idina Menzel) and Anna (trilled by Kristen Bell), along with sassy snowman Olaf (hilarious Josh Gad), lovesick Kristoff (dreamy Jonathan Groff) and Sven the mostly silent reindeer as they set off on a new adventure that might get them all killed.
Last time, Elsa ran off to a winter fortress because her uncontrollable fingertips could fast freeze anything they touched, including Anna, who coaxed Elsa back without leaning on any dude. Even hunky Prince Hans (Santino Fontana) turned out to be a scheming bastard. It was truly a case of the sisters doing it for themselves. Sweet.
This time, Elsa is back on the throne in Arendelle with Anna by her side. But Elsa keeps hearing this haunting melody wafting in from up north. Is it the enchanted forest of Ahtohallan where the indigenous Northuldra tribe holds sway and where Elsa thinks she’ll find answers about the source of her own mysterious powers? Of course it is. Flashbacks provide clues through the royal sisters’ parents, King Agnarr (Alfred Molina) and Queen Iduna (Evan Rachel Wood), and grandfather King Runeard (Jeremy Sisto), all of whom may have fallen victim to an icy curse that Elsa means to thaw. She even sings “Into the Unknown,” a power ballad meant to follow “Let It Go” to Oscar glory and remind you that the trumpet-tonsiled Menzel has a voice that shakes the rafters.
For the sisters and their tribe, the road to Ahtohallan is filled with perils, especially those huge rocks that turn out to be menacing giants. And watch out for what’s under the sea. There are also new characters, including an impressive Sterling K. Brown voicing a soldier trapped in a frozen…well, it’s best we stop there in the name of “no spoilers.” Just know that Elsa must fight through a ghostly shadow world before she reaches the light.
It helps having jaunty tunes for Olaf (“When I’m Older”), Kristoff (“Lost in the Woods”) and Anna (“Some Things Never Change”) to cut through the murk. Jennifer Lee, who writes and directs with Chris Buck, can sometimes lose us in a thicket of convoluted plot lines. But the delight and dazzle of this frosty follow-up brings it all home in a climax that should have audiences panting for a part III. Why is the sequel never the equal? Frozen II just might break the jinx. There’s magic in it."
165,MAS_Doc5_FrozenII,MAS,Comedy,Positive,Frozen II,"With “Frozen II,” Disney has done the impossible: It’s made a terrific animated-musical sequel.
Over the past 25 years, the studio has released a heap of direct-to-video follow-ups to its biggest hits, such as “Return of Jafar” and “The Lion King 1½.” All of them have been forgettable at best, forever banished to the darkest corners of Disney+.
But the curse has been lifted. The second “Frozen” is even better than the first, with dazzling animation and a more mature and tuneful score. Call it “The Icicle Strikes Back.”
Elsa once sang, “I’m never going back! The past is in the past!” And “Frozen II” has wisely followed that path. Instead of rehashing the 2013 film, and piling on complications involving the queen’s magical ability to freeze with her fingertips, we start fresh with a new, out-of-the-icebox adventure.
Our heroine now sits on the throne of Arendelle, but despite the highs of being queen, Elsa (Idina Menzel) feels a nagging void. She begins hearing a siren song calling her into the distance when a supernatural force ravages the kingdom. She believes that the ethereal song, and the source of the damage, are both from an enchanted forest her mom told her about as a kid. Could it also hold the key to her magical powers? So, off she goes, along with sister Anna (Kristen Bell), snowman Olaf (Josh Gad), doofy Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and Sven the reindeer.
The most important question for parents: What song will I be forced to play in the car on an endless loop until what seems like the end of time? That would be “Into the Unknown,” which Elsa belts out before embarking on her journey. It’s a rousing number that nicely sums up the movie’s more adult blend of darkness and whimsy, with more world-weary lyrics like, “I’ve had my adventure. I don’t need something new. I am afraid of what I’m risking if I follow you.” It’s also got a bang-up cover by Panic! At the Disco.
Once we’re in the woods, a land magically barricaded from the outside world, Disney’s prettiest landscapes and characters since 2017’s “Coco” come to life. The first “Frozen” vastly exceeded box-office expectations, and its sequel looks much more big-budget as a result. The hot-pink fire demon pulses with color, and the rock ogres look as good as any creature in “The Lord of the Rings.”
Don’t worry — it’s not all monsters and deep meaning. The music, by Oscar winners Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, is actually much funnier this time around. Gad’s Olaf sings a delightful song — as he’s being chased by terrors in the forest — about how everything will make sense when he’s older. And Groff sounds great as Kristoff during a country-tinged ballad that looks like a Carly Simon video.
That tune is called “Lost In the Woods,” but the “Frozen” franchise is very much found in the forest. Elsa’s powers and insecurities are still the star, of course, but this film should confirm to Disney just how perfect this entire ensemble of characters is. Heck, I’d watch a sequel in which Elsa and friends go to Costco … “Frozen Foods Aisle”!"
166,MAS_Doc6_FrozenII,MAS,Comedy,Negative,Frozen II,"Once upon a time, Disney sent its subpar sequels to the kingdom of Straight-to-Video — a magical land filled with such titles as “The Return of Jafar,” “Cinderella II: Dreams Come True” and “The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea.” It was a happier time, one that is now apparently over, as “Frozen II” hits theaters.
That’s slightly unfair. The sequel to the 2013 animated blockbuster is much better than, say, “Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World.”
But “Frozen II” is still a disappointing continuation of the story of Queen Elsa and Princess Anna of Arendelle. It’s been a few years since Elsa (voice of Idina Menzel) learned to embrace her icy powers and settled on her throne. Little sister Anna (Kristen Bell) is still with hunky lunk Kristoff (Jonathan Groff). And may I say that it is nice to see a Disney princess in a long-term, stable relationship that suggests a real happy-ever-after? Living snowman Olaf (Josh Gad) continues to hang around, though now he has a fixation on the temporary nature of existence, really. Otherwise, things are going well in the charmingly Nordic kingdom, right up until Elsa begins hearing a lone voice singing from afar. Not long after the song begins — although only Elsa can hear it — the people of Arendelle experience some oddities, culminating in an earthquake that sends the entire population heading for the hills.
Elsa, Anna, Olaf and Kristoff, along with his reindeer buddy Sven, travel even further into the mountains, eventually coming upon an impenetrable mist — impenetrable, that is, until Elsa touches it. Beyond the veil they find two groups who have been trapped, and at one another’s throats, for 30 years: the first being several soldiers from Arendelle, and the second an Inuit-like tribe of magic-embracing people called the Northuldra.
To solve the problem of the mist — and the misunderstanding that has led to the decades-long cold war — Elsa decides to set out alone to find a river, once presumed mythical, that she hopes will have the answers to these mysteries, as well as the question of from where her powers come. Anna wants to go with her for protection.
But sometimes an Ice Queen has to work alone.
“Frozen II” starts off on shaky ground, largely because it backtracks on much of the character development Anna and Elsa went though in the first movie. At the end of “Frozen,” Elsa had learned that her powers were a gift, not a burden, and she had become confident and proud in using them. At the beginning of “Frozen II,” that confidence is gone. She has an air of timidity that doesn’t make sense, given how we last saw her. Anna, whose loneliness in the first film led her to pursue a misguided romance that nearly left her dead, seems to have settled into life with family — complete with regular Friday night games of charades. But her focus on saving Elsa from danger now seems to come from a place of desperation, rather than love.
Whatever technical advancements have been made in computer animation over the past six years aren’t readily apparent in “Frozen II,” which mostly has the same frosty look as the first film. An impressive sea battle between Elsa and a glowing ice horse — just go with it — is as good as the visuals get. There are also several moments where the action takes place against a completely black background, presumably to better set off Elsa’s icy creations. But it’s a jarring change of scenery that doesn’t deliver any sort of visual or emotional payoff.
The biggest disappointment? The music. In “Frozen,” even the throwaway songs had wit. And the lyrics of that inescapable earworm “Let It Go” are actually deeply layered — a fact that is sometimes overlooked, in the face of the song’s ubiquity. Both Bell and Menzel bring impressive vocal skills, and Groff, a Broadway star who only got to sing a few lines in the first film, gets his moment in the spotlight with the hilarious, ’80s-inspired “Lost in the Woods.” But there isn’t really a standout song in the bunch. Returning composers Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez try to give Elsa two showstopping numbers: “Into the Unknown” and “Show Yourself.” But neither song reaches any emotional heights. (Never mind that there really isn’t a show to stop.)
Yes, “Frozen II” is a letdown when compared with the original. But it’s also a lackluster disappointment on its own — a pale shadow of what it could have been. It’s hard to see how the same team who made something so cool in 2013 could deliver something so — there’s no other word for it — lukewarm."
167,MAS_Doc7_FrozenII,MAS,Comedy,Negative,Frozen II,"Six years ago, Disney released what would become not just the biggest hit in its long history of theatrical cartoons but also, globally speaking, the biggest animated movie ever, period. What, a bean counter might desperately wonder, was the key to the film’s unprecedented success? Here’s one wild theory: Frozen, that runaway winter-wonderland smash, appealed nearly as much to the young parents in the audience as to the kids they were chaperoning. Working from the template of the Hans Christian Anderson classic The Snow Queen, the tireless Mouse House team offered a savvy tweak of storybook lore, making the white-knight characters into, respectively, a villain and a supportive boyfriend, while resting the emotional stakes on the platonic love between sisters. Yet these revisionist and mildly progressive touches were mostly accents on a throwback princess adventure, the kind plenty of moms and dads grew up watching during the so-called Disney Renaissance. For guardians of a certain age, it was a real have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too situation: a hearteningly “modern” fairy tale that wasn’t so modern that it couldn’t deliver a nostalgia rush of twinkly, familiar Disney magic. It was new but also old, quite profitably.
“New but also old” is a time-honored recipe for sequels, too. Naturally, it’s the one they’ve opted to follow for Frozen II, an inevitable return to the udder of a reliable cash cow (or reindeer, if you prefer). But since the original was already a play on formula, subverting some conventions while adhering to others, that compounds the redundancy of this lavish but unadventurous follow-up. Though it technically lays out a different narrative for the royal sisters and their posse of friends, Frozen II takes the very Disney route of offering more of the same, just with a fresh coat of paint. Creatively, it’s not too far removed from those high-tech cover versions of old animated hits the company has been churning out these past few years. At least here there’s another story to tell, though even that’s been designed to address lingering questions and unresolved backstory from the last one, rather than pave a truly new path.
Of course, maybe that’s the smart route to take with a sequel to a movie the target audience has likely committed to memory. For plenty of viewers (especially the ones that have loved Frozen their whole lives), just seeing these already immortal characters again will be enough. After an opening flashback to the childhood of its heroines—a load-bearing sequence that sets up some of the conflicts and mythology that will come into play—Frozen II launches into the new status quo, circa three years after the events of its six-year-old predecessor. Life in the kingdom of Arendelle is stable and peaceful, perhaps too much so for comfort. Nattering, ambling Olaf (Josh Gad, scoring some laughs, at least for those amenable to his naïf shtick) worries aloud about the impermanence of things—a reasonable anxiety for sentient snowmen and growing children alike. His concerns are confirmed when ice-powered Queen Elsa (Idina Menzel) is drawn to a lilting voice coming from the horizon—a clarion call she responds to in song, accidentally awakening the magical forest her parents told her (and us) about in the prologue. She heads off to investigate and stop the snowstorms threatening her town, reluctantly agreeing to the backup company of sister Anna (Kristen Bell) and the sidekick squad.
Once upon a time, Frozen II would have gone straight to the shelves of your local Blockbuster, cheaply and hastily fulfilling its purpose of squeezing some extra money out of parents searching for an alternative, any alternative, to watching the exact same movie even one more time. But in 2019, a hit of Frozen’s proportions earns the full blue-chip franchise-extending treatment. The money and time invested certainly made it up on screen: Frozen II is a marvel of color and texture, especially once the group arrives at their destination, a cursed woodland imprisoning two once-adversarial people and ruled by the four elements, each granted a mind of its own. (Water is the star of this abstract supergroup, at least visually speaking; you hope the animators got a fat Christmas bonus for the way they’ve made it move and shimmer and crash against the surf during one dynamically staged action sequence.)
As usual, though, the astronomical resources poured into an animated blockbuster haven’t necessarily spurred the writing team—made up here of Jennifer Lee, who again directed with Chris Buck, and Hidden Figures cowriter Allison Schroeder—to rise to the occasion. Frozen II cleanly lays out solvable conflicts for each of its returning principles. Will Anna earn her magically endowed sister’s confidence and prove herself as valuable to the kingdom? Will iceman love interest Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) find the perfect way to pop the question? Will Olaf stop fretting about how everything will make more sense when he’s older? Speaking of Gad’s comic-relief character, the film deploys him as a lampshade, too—a way to poke fun at the endless exposition while still, you know, helping deliver it. Frozen II is definitely a movie for anyone who’s spent the last few years agonizing about how Elsa got her powers. Those fans hoping, however, that she’ll use them to dazzle a suitress will be disappointed to learn that her love life remains entirely theoretical; they’ll have to make do with a scene where she briefly talks to another woman.
The voice work remains exemplary. Bell, especially, sells the heightened emotional beats of this streamlined adventure, even when they feel a little canned. And everyone exerts themselves commendably during the musical-theater portions of the evening. The songs, written again by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, follow the play-it-again imperative, serviceably replicating the inspirational swell and warm wisecrackery of the enormously popular soundtrack they contributed last time around. Best of the bunch is an early showstopper for Menzel, who gets to duet with the distant, haunting vocal refrain that calls to her, showing off her powerhouse, Broadway-honed pipes in the aim-for-the-cheap-seats chorus. Still, nothing else here—not the small-town group number, not Gad’s dopey slapstick solo, not the power ballad composed for Kristoff (complete with amusing hair-metal guitar licks)—is likely to earn a permanent place alongside “Let It Go” or “Do You Want To Build A Snowman?” on the office-karaoke or ride-to-school playlist.
Lightly extending the progressive spin of the original, Frozen II comes to revolve around the question of accountability, and how we make up for the sins of the past and our ancestors. It’s almost a reparations story, really, which would be more touching—and interesting—if the sacrifices stuck. In the same year as Endgame, you have to wonder what kids are learning about consequences from movies more than happy to roll them back in search of a happier ending. You also gain renewed respect for the sister-company artists at Pixar, who remain willing—even as their output has met Disney proper’s in the middle, quality-wise, over much of this decade—to commit to their moments of tearjerking loss. Frozen wasn’t exactly a game-changer; superficially subversive, it appealingly bent without breaking family-film rules. But the tune the film belted was its own, however indebted it was to tradition. Frozen II is just an echo, drawing prospective fans in without finding many new notes to hit.
"
168,MAS_Doc8_FrozenII,MAS,Comedy,Negative,Frozen II,"Elsa does not get a girlfriend in Frozen II, with condolences to the fans who pleaded to Disney for one, like supplicants petitioning an indifferent corporate god. The frosty former princess does, however, get a magical horse, and it’s pretty sick. It is, technically, a water spirit called a Nokk, but what matters is that it’s crystalline and capable of galloping across the surface of the ocean in a way that both looks cool and makes Elsa’s silver hair, unleashed from its braid, flutter aspirationally in the wind. That’s the kind of sight that you can imagine making a child’s heart explode with covetous delight, especially one of the little girls who were key to making the first Frozen a beast of a $1.27 billion global hit in 2013, and who pushed its breakout ballad “Let It Go” into brain-melting inescapability.
Frozen II is, like its predecessor, a kids’ movie, but it’s also, like its predecessor, an official Walt Disney Animation Studios release, which means it’s a vector for merchandise, music, theme-park rides, eventual remakes, and a young generation’s pop cultural pressure points. There is every possibility that “Into the Unknown” — the new designated banger from songwriting team Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, featuring the same sort of soaring chorus and the same high note as Let It Go — will become aural wallpaper in the houses and vehicles of families around the world. The tendency people have developed to talk about these movies as bearing a public responsibility is both a symptom of our disturbingly parasocial relationship with a massive media conglomerate, and an acknowledgment of that massive media conglomerate’s awesome reach and influence. Disney doles out its milestones of representation in intensely calculated dribs and drabs. It’ll only give one of its princesses more than an “exclusively gay moment” once its sure it can maximize plaudits for its progressiveness while preserving its bottom line in more repressive international regions.
It’s easier to think about Frozen II as a product than as a film because a (sometimes stunning-looking) product is all that it feels like. It was directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, the team behind the first film, from a script that Lee wrote, and that never really pretends that it exists because the story, rather than the market, demanded more. That story has the feel of the kind of invented errand that used to fuel countless direct-to-video sequels, only this one’s been blown up to a grand scale, with accompanying sumptuous production values. Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel) is now queen of the hygge-heavy kingdom of Arendelle, though she’s distracted by a haunting call that only she can seem to hear. Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), still accompanied by his reindeer, Sven, is working his way up to proposing to Elsa’s sister, Anna (Kristen Bell). Then there’s the snowman. There is, I regret to inform you, an awful lot of the snowman, Olaf (Josh Gad), which, alongside Elsa’s ascendance to lead, indicates that some fan demands were heeded.
The group hauls off to the north in order to save Arendelle from a plot device, finding their way to an enchanted forest that’s home to the Sámi-inspired Northuldra tribe. The Northuldra, led by Yelana (Martha Plimpton), have a fraught history with Arendelle, once approached as allies until something went wrong and the area was sealed off by mist. The mystery behind these events will turn out to involve the colonialist ambitions of a past king and a betrayal that reveals that illustrious ancestors are rarely all they’re idealized to be — ambitious stuff from the company that made Pocahontas, though the inevitable happy resolution suggests that these films still aren’t exactly up to reckoning with restitutions for inherited trauma. That mystery, anyway, becomes intertwined with a journey of self-discovery involving an explanation for Elsa’s powers, and while that resolves in a sequence that I’m still not entirely sure I understand, it does manage to once again gift the character with a gleaming new outfit.
It’s hard not to feel jaded about Frozen II, while also understanding that those feelings don’t matter at all, and that the film is going to go on to draw huge audiences heavy on children and accompanying parents who’ll appreciate being thrown a bone by way of Kristoff’s amusingly ’80s-rock-inflected number. The film comes from a tradition that has spawned both incredible classics of animated artistry and overtly calculating entertainments, and it happens to skew more toward the latter. It’s carefully modulated to reach the widest possible audience while offering just enough for the adults in the room to shrug and think, Hey, at least these are strong female characters, right? And the thing is that, even as a mostly mercenary endeavor, the movie is still capable of moments of astonishing beauty. Take, for instance, the sequence in which Elsa attempts to cross a stormy sea, trying and failing to use ice to crest the raging waves. It’s in those waters that she battles the Nokk, eventually finding a way to get on its back and ride away triumphant. Adult me knows that thing is already available in toy stores, but child me would have died to have one."
169,MAS_Doc9_FrozenII,MAS,Comedy,Negative,Frozen II,"Disney has produced a few hit films in its time, but Frozen stands as one of the most staggering successes in the studio’s nine-decade history. Released in November 2013, the animation became the highest-grossing film of the year – and that was just the beginning. In 2014, every car with children in the back seat – and some without – had the hit single Let It Go on the stereo.
Inevitably, a sequel was made. And, almost inevitably, it’s nowhere near as good. Like the first film, this one is directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, scripted by Lee, and punctuated with songs by Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez. But the catchy Broadway show-stoppers have been replaced by thudding rock-opera power ballads; the glacial clarity of the coming-of-age theme has been replaced by a flurry of mythological codswallop; and the urgency of Anna’s journey to bring her sister home has been replaced by the apathy of Elsa’s wish to learn about her past.  
It takes an ice age for it to get going. In the early scenes, the film-makers’ priority isn’t to send Anna and Elsa off on an adventure, but to show off their Nordic haute couture. There are more costume changes in Frozen II than there are at a Beyoncé concert. Most Disney princess animations are intended to sell party dresses to children, but this is the first which is so obviously meant to launch a fashion line. 
The film opens with a flashback to the sisters as small children pretending to be in an enchanted forest. This is their father’s cue to tell them about the enchanted forest he visited, and so we get another flashback in which a diplomatic party from Arendelle discover a distant land where the people have a magical connection to nature. Once we have swallowed that steaming bowl of exposition, the girls’ mother serves up a dollop more – something to do with a mystic river. And then, at last, the film’s title flashes on the screen.
In the present day, Anna (Kristen Bell) and Queen Elsa (Idina Menzel) are happily ruling the fjord-side kingdom of Arendelle, but they and their friends have some niggling problems. Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) wants to propose to Anna, but he isn’t sure how. Olaf (Josh Gad), the sentient snowman, is fretting about the impermanence of all things, a concern which leads to a couple of endearing songs, but not much else. And Elsa is troubled by a mysterious psychic voice calling her to the far north. This leads to a song, too, in which she declares that she isn’t going to answer the voice’s siren call, but then changes her mind before the final chorus.
And so, for the vaguest of reasons, the gang sets off on another quest. Unfortunately, they don’t encounter any sneaky villains or ravenous wolves, and so the filmmakers manufacture some conflict by turning Anna into a co-dependent brat who keeps snapping at Elsa and Kristoff. Was she this tetchy and judgemental in the last film? I doubt the others would have rushed to her aid in the finale if she had been.
Lacking any real jeopardy, Frozen II is a meandering psychedelic journey involving standing stones, elemental spirits, time-warping glaciers, the Dark Sea, and a supernatural fog reminiscent of Alex Garland’s sci-fi horror movie, Annihilation. It’s also reminiscent of a Tolkien fantasy saga, although its fixation on the characters’ origins and their homeland’s politics may bring back traumatic memories of the Star Wars prequels. The script tries to answer the questions raised in the first film, even though none of them needed answering, but its convoluted explanations are so perplexing that there may need to be a third film just to answer all the questions raised in this one. Strangely, one sequence comes very close to explaining why Kristoff had no parents in Frozen, just a reindeer and an adoptive family of trolls, but someone must have cut the sequence in which everything becomes clear.
Narratively, Frozen II is a mess, an avalanche of half-formed ideas which might have been more suited to a spin-off novel or a video game, and which leaves us asking WTF, or What The Frozen? And yet, beyond its thicket of tangled concepts and subplots, there is nothing to it but one small revelation which astute viewers will have predicted after five minutes. Remember how we were all fooled into thinking that dastardly Prince Hans was the hero in Frozen? The twists in Frozen II are fumbled in comparison. When your story relies on snow statues coming to life at convenient moments and acting out arguments that took place 30 years earlier, that’s probably a sign that your screenplay could do with another two or three drafts.
In a way, it’s admirable that Buck and Lee didn’t play it safe, and that instead of making a simple fairy-tale they attempted a world-building, mind-expanding epic. It certainly won’t prompt many karaoke nights or repertory-cinema singalongs, but their barely comprehensible folly is so weird and bleak, and so full of magnificent, hallucinatory imagery, that it could be embraced by students as a midnight movie. Younger Elsa and Anna fans, on the other hand, will either be covering their eyes in distress or scratching their heads in confusion. Frozen II will leave them cold."
170,MAS_Doc10_FrozenII,MAS,Comedy,Negative,Frozen II,"The Walt Disney megabrand is funny about sequels. Officially, it doesn’t like them. In its near century-long history Walt Disney Animation Studios has made only a handful of “theatrical sequels” (including The Rescuers Down Under and Fantasia 2000).
However, in the straight-to-video market, Disney cannot get enough of them. The studio bashes out any old crap for a quick buck. Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp’s Adventure? 101 Dalmatians II: Patch’s London Adventure? The Lion King 2: Simba’s Pride? They are babysitting aids. They are supermarket fillers. They are cynical and tacky brand polluters.
Frozen 2 isn’t at that level of cheap exploitation (the production values are eye-gougingly lavish), but it’s close. Struggling throughout for a reason to be, other than to reacquaint the world and its wallet with the most famous singing siblings since the Nolan Sisters, the movie consistently ticks boxes and executes songs and set pieces with all the verve of a mildly depressed accountant talking you through his latest spreadsheet.
Yes, Elsa is back! She’s the magical one from the kingdom of Arendelle (not, apparently, based on Arundel, just along the A27 from Chichester) who shoots ice lasers from her fingers and is voiced by Idina Menzel with her range turned up to a billion (remember “Let it gooo! Let it goooooooooo!”?). Her sister Anna (Kristen Bell) is back too. She’s the boring one with no superpowers who is now dating barrel-chested wood-cutting jerk Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and is foster mother to Olaf, a “hilarious” wisecracking snowman voiced by Josh Gad.
Olaf is the quintessential Disney sidekick, up there with Genie from Aladdin, Dory from Finding Nemo and Timon and Pumbaa from The Lion King. He is hyperactive, suffers from verbal diarrhoea, consistently annoys everyone around him (but in a very hilarious way, natch), and you mostly, from his first scene, want him dead. He has also been designed as the perfect stocking filler, branded teddy or wacky bedside lamp, which makes it worse.
In narrative terms the film is spectacularly inept. The co-creators of the first movie, Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck, have returned and worked with a team of committed writers. They have apparently studied the phenomenal impact of the original and asked themselves: “How can we do it all again, beat for beat, emotional arc for emotional arc, yet this time make it convoluted and dramatically deadening by shifting all the attention on to some nebulous themes about environmental exploitation and how western societies are inherently destructive while all indigenous peoples are gentle souls who dress like Pocahontas and have access to primitive magic?”
Yes, in a curious example of woke racism, our patronising colonial heroes travel to the magical Enchanted Forest, where they encounter a tribe of non-specific indigenous nature lovers who agree, bizarrely, to help Kristoff with his secret marriage proposal to Anna, and to help Elsa to answer the crucial question that was bubbling from the lips of every adult who saw, and was fascinated by, the first movie. No, not “Does Elsa have a girlfriend?” No, the question, according the film-makers, that everybody was asking the first time round was: “Where were Elsa and Anna’s parents going in that boat when they drowned in that storm?” Literally, no one.
Never fear, if the plot seems like heavy weather, you can always marvel at the seven new derivative and alarmingly bland show tunes from the original songwriters, the husband-and-wife team Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez. Elsa, for instance, decides to embrace the challenges of life by belting out a Let it Go knock-off called Into the Unknown, or, more accurately, Into the Unknoooooooown! Because she sings it when she finally realises that “part of me has to go . . . into the unknooooooooooooown!”
The other songs are equally disposable, although at least the final big battering ram, Show Yourself, also one of Elsa’s, attempts some narrative exposition instead of just stopping dead in generic musical slop. The visuals, as expected, are lovely (the movie had a multimillion-dollar budget), but there’s little here to match the revolutionary power (sisters are doing it for themselves) of the first film. The impression left, instead, is of a movie, like Disney’s straight-to-video sequel Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True, that can’t quite justify its existence as anything other than a cash grab."
171,ATJ_Doc1_GuardiansOftheGalaxy,ATJ,Sci-Fi,Positive,Guardians of the Galaxy,"From its opening credit sequence, which finds Chris Pratt boogeying through an alien landscape to the strains of Redbone’s “Come and Get Your Love,” Guardians of the Galaxy seems the perfect antidote to Serious Summer Blockbuster Syndrome, a blissfully goofy and tartly self-aware slab of sci-fi silliness. Writer/director James Gunn is another of Marvel’s unconventional hires — his pitch-black 2010 comedy Super features Rainn Wilson as a mentally unbalanced would-be superhero who attacks people with a hammer while shouting “Shut up, crime!” — and for much of Guardians’ 122 minutes, Gunn’s grab-bag of quirky characters, genre ribbing, and incongruent ‘70s pop tunes goes over like gangbusters. The trouble is, it’s only irreverent to a point, and when the time comes to wrap things up, Gunn plays it strictly by the book. And this is becoming a real problem in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Two things should be clarified here. First, Guardians of the Galaxy is genuinely enjoyable. It’s got a sense of humor and a sense of fun too often lacking in big tentpole movies (and no, the “comic relief” of, say, a Transformers movie doesn’t count — often, such dick-joke breaks are more depressing than amusing). Much of the picture is a showcase of the shambling comic ingenuity of star Pratt, who plays Peter “Star-Lord” Quill as a looser, hornier Han Solo, though he can barely keep Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) from stealing the picture out from under him. The tone is comic, as well it should be — we’re talking about a movie where two of the main characters are a genetically modified, wisecracking raccoon and a monosyllabic tree creature. Gunn has fun sending up the conventions of peripheral characters (when tough guy Drax tells a would-be attacker, “I like your knife, I’m keeping it,” Gunn stays with the poor sap long enough for him to mutter, sadly, “That was my favorite knife…”), and he’s a got a knack for sly visual comedy (there’s a background gag involving a battery theft that produces a long, sustained laugh). Most of all, he’s allowed to imbue the project with a kind of bouncy eccentricity — but only within the confines of the now-established Marvel formula. So that means we’ve got to sit through a bunch of frightfully dull exposition about the Kree and Thanos and Xandar and so forth, none of which actually matters (beyond making tenuous connections to other Marvel movies), because in the kind of roughhouse comedy Gunn seems to aspire to, the plot isn’t actually important beyond its capacity to serve as a clothesline for hanging comic sequences. (These scenes also make the puzzling error of hiring Lee Pace and then hiding him under layers of make-up, much as Thor: The Dark World wasted an unrecognizable Christopher Eccleston.) And that means we have to have a big action set piece at the conclusion of the second act, in which our heroes are defeated, and all seems lost. And, most importantly, we have to have a giant, effects-heavy climactic battle, in which many things are blown up really good."
172,ATJ_Doc2_GuardiansOftheGalaxy,ATJ,Sci-Fi,Positive,Guardians of the Galaxy,"Superhero origin stories, for the most part, aren’t very original. They all to some extent involve a young child or particularly immature man falling prey to a terrible crime, accident, experiment, or, alternately, reluctantly getting chosen by higher powers. Then comes a period of shock swiftly followed by a period of combat training—for, as all comic lovers understand, a true hero directs his mournful energies toward coordinating outfits, gadgets, and crime-fighting prowess around a theme. The takeaway: Superheroes are just like you and me until something genuinely terrible befalls them—then, an inhumanly noble hunger to fight crime takes over. On the surface, Guardians of the Galaxy, Marvel’s latest movie, is an origin story, too. Given the obscurity of the source comic, it has to be: Our heroes, a bunch of alien rogues, were introduced briefly in a 1969 issue of Marvel Superheroes, played benchwarmers to the likes of the Avengers for about 50 years, then were revived by writers Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning in 2008 to middling sales. To counteract the risk of the venture we follow recognizable white male Chris Pratt, newly buff and emotional, playing Peter Quill, a boy who was abducted by aliens and now calls himself “Star-Lord.” Sensibly, Peter’s chosen alias is roundly mocked by his fellow Guardians in the film—as is his masculinity, wooing capabilities, general leadership, and other qualities that usually endorse newbie heroes in tights. Pratt is at the point in his career when critics would label him an “unlikely leading man”; here he actually plays one to his scrappy, squabbling intergalactic crew. As the title suggests, they’re the real heroes of this kinda-sorta-superhero movie. If Guardians of the Galaxy is an origin story, it is also a satire of the origin story, one that emphasizes the power of the “We” over that of the “Chosen One.” Every member of the Guardians has known deep trauma. Chris Pratt’s lead Peter Quill lost his mom (cancer); Zoe Saldana’s Gamora is practically dead to the last surviving member of her family Nebula (Karen Gillan); her previous colleague-in-crime Ronan (Lee Pace) slaughtered the family of Dave Bautista’s Drax; and Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) doesn’t even have a family since, as a human experiment in anthropomorphization gone wrong, he’s basically a lab animal.* As for his pet, the sentient tree Groot (Vin Diesel), who knows? He can only string together three words (the innocuous truth, “I am Groot”). Judging by the way he tortures his adversaries—pushing his roots into their nostrils, out other orifices—it’s safe to assume the tree has issues, too. But in contrast to the rest of the genre, these sob stories don’t bestow nobility. No one’s particular woes are more “super” than another’s. In fact, any attempt at tragedy one-upmanship would counteract the movie’s shaggy, communal comedy. The Guardians aren’t superheroes so much as they are a heterogeneous mix of losers, bandits, and outlaws who know just how unexceptional they are. As Chris Pratt's character says to rally the troops, “I look around and I see losers. Like, people who have lost something.”"
173,ATJ_Doc3_GuardiansOftheGalaxy,ATJ,Sci-Fi,Negative,Guardians of the Galaxy,"Based on an obscure Marvel comic book, Guardians of the Galaxy follows a ragtag group of superheroes (Chris Pratt's Peter Quill, Zoe Saldana's Gamora, Dave Bautista's Drax, Bradley Cooper's Rocket, and Vin Diesel's Groot) as they reluctantly combine forces to take down a nefarious figure known as Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace). Filmmaker James Gunn, working from a screenplay written with Nicole Perlman, does a superb job of immediately luring the viewer into the larger-than-life storyline, as the movie boasts a lighthearted and effortlessly entertaining opening half hour that seems to promise a fun, old-school adventure. It's clear, too, that the roster of uniformly affable characters goes a long way towards perpetuating the likeable vibe, with Pratt's star-making turn as the movie's cocky protagonist matched by a supporting cast rife with charismatic, memorable figures. The film begins to stumble, then, once the focus shifts to a narrative that's almost distractingly convoluted, as Gunn and Perlman suffuse the dense storyline with references and plot devices that generally soar over the average viewer's head - with the presence of obscure, Marvel-specific elements only exacerbating the movie's increasingly esoteric, uninvolving vibe (ie it becomes more and more difficult to work up any real enthusiasm for or interest in the protagonists' mission). Gunn's ongoing emphasis on CGI-heavy and aggressively generic space battles doesn't help matters, while the seemingly endless final stretch ensures that Guardians of the Galaxy concludes on as anticlimactic a note as one could've possibly envisioned - which is a shame, certainly, given the preponderance of decidedly above-average elements within the production (eg Pratt's completely endearing performance is alone almost able to compensate for the film's various missteps). A marginal improvement over its lackluster predecessor, Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2 follows the first film’s ragtag band of space heroes (Chris Pratt’s Star-Lord, Zoe Saldana’s Gamora, Dave Bautista’s Drax, Vin Diesel’s Baby Groot, and Bradley Cooper’s Rocket Raccoon) as their bond threatens to break after Star-Lord reunites with his long, lost father (Kurt Russell’s Ego). Filmmaker James Gunn does an absolutely smashing job of immediately drawing the viewer into the overlong proceedings, as Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2 kicks off with a seriously entertaining opening credits sequence that seems like it’s going to be the highlight of the entire picture (and indeed this is ultimately the case). And although the various performers are as charismatic as one might’ve anticipated – Pratt is especially winning here – the movie, perhaps inevitably, segues into a meandering midsection that’s bursting with needless diversions and subplots (ie Gunn’s screenplay could’ve used some major streamlining). The vibe of pervasive wheel-spinning persists throughout and yet it’s clear that Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2’s narrative eventually does come together, with the film benefiting substantially from Russell’s typically strong turn as the mysterious figure who triggers the predictably larger-than-life third act. (It’s worth noting, however, that the movie’s final stretch, which is rife with over-the-top special effects and action, isn’t quite as intolerable as most other comic-book movies of this ilk.) It is, in the end, clear that Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2 falls right in line with the many, many other movies contained in Marvel's cinematic universe, as the positive impact of the film's handful of stirring sequences is dulled considerably by an almost excessively flabby atmosphere (ie why are all of these movies well over two hours?)"
174,ATJ_Doc4_GuardiansOftheGalaxy,ATJ,Sci-Fi,Negative,Guardians of the Galaxy,"James Gunn’s Guardians of the Galaxy isn’t a superhero flick. At its best, it even forgets to be a Marvel movie, casting off corporate shackles to let its freak flag fly. Benefiting from the relative freedom afforded by distance from the franchise mainstream of square-jawed superheroes, it becomes at various points a prison saga, a space opera, a swashbuckling adventure, even a self-aware parody. When it works, the film is a stylish reimagining of myriad influences ranging from Silver Age comics to vintage sci-fi serials, charged with visual inventiveness and Whedon-esque repartee. When it doesn’t, it’s guilty of all the usual franchise pitfalls, from the steaming dumps of exposition to the numbingly bombastic finale. For every scene that soars into the dizzying heights of the pop sublime, there’s another that crashes back down into the mundane troughs of studio-mandated formula. The result is a superior pulp entertainment whose greater potential is nonetheless stifled by the airless confines of the Marvel assembly line. The film begins with a brief flashback detailing a pivotal moment in the childhood of Peter Quill (played in the prologue by Wyatt Oleff), one in which he’s inexplicably abducted from Earth by interstellar pirates right after watching his mother succumb to cancer. Cut to what might be the most breathtaking title shot in Marvel history as Quill—grown into a Han-Solo-ish space brigand played by Chris Pratt—dances across the desolate surface of an abandoned planet to Redbone’s “Come and Get Your Love,” backlit by a galaxy’s worth of stars. It’s MAD Magazine meets Analog in an indelible image that establishes the irreverent tone adopted by director and co-writer Gunn throughout. Quill, a.k.a. Star-Lord, is on the planet to steal a celestial orb, a McGuffin typical of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in that it’s a magic rock that either destroys those who wield it or grants them godlike powers. It’s soon apparent that the orb is also being sought by Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace), an alien zealot united in genocidal intent with all-powerful cosmic entity Thanos (Josh Brolin). Initially motivated by the promise of untold wealth and, later, by a budding conscience, Quill assembles a motley crew of intergalactic undesirables to help him safeguard the Orb, including a green-skinned assassin named Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Rocket the anthropomorphic raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper), a sentient tree called Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), and Drax the Destroyer, a vengeful warrior played with a surprisingly deft comedic touch by pro wrestler Dave Bautista. More than any comic-book adaptation in recent memory, Guardians of the Galaxy has a sense of humor about itself, a quality expressed by its joke-a-minute screenplay and Looney Tunes-esque approach to action: visual gags abound, many of the fight scenes verge on slapstick, and characters routinely emerge from explosions with little more than singed eyebrows. The margins of the frame are frequently stuffed with vividly realized creature designs and outré world-building elements, not to mention an inspired pratfall or three."
175,ATJ_Doc5_GuardiansOftheGalaxy,ATJ,Sci-Fi,Negative,Guardians of the Galaxy,"“Guardians of the Galaxy” brings to mind some of the most unforgettable sci-fi event movies of the last 30 years. Alas, those films are “Howard the Duck” and “Green Lantern.”Chris Pratt stars as an interstellar frat-boy Indiana Jones, out to steal and sell a precious orb that looks like a wire Christmas ornament from Pier 1 Imports. He teams up with a lady warrior (Zoe Saldana, this time in greenface) who is double-crossing her villainous boss; a wisecracking, Joisey-accented bounty-hunter raccoon (Bradley Cooper, stealing work from Gilbert Gottfried); a large killer plant who says only “I am Groot” (though Vin Diesel is the one they hired to say this); and Drax (Dave Bautista), a block of muscle and tats. Our hero, scruff-faced earthling Peter (Pratt), speaks in the kind of slang that passes for wit down at Delta Psi — just keep saying “dude,” “chill” or “bro,” it’ll be hilarious. Drax issues dumb-guy chatter that’s meant to bring relief to low-IQ audience members. He doesn’t get metaphors, see? “Nothing goes over my head. My reflexes are too fast.” Hey, Drax, Joey Tribbiani thinks your shtick is old. As the gang of outlaws whizzes around the universe, villains as fragile as Pringles line up to be obediently killed, amid dialogue that’s a jarring mix of fusty Conan-the-Barbarian-isms (“Spare me your foul gaze, woman”) and bro talk (“They got my d -  - k message!”). For background filler there are tunes from Peter’s beloved ’70s pop mixtape. Out: John Williams. In: “The Piña Colada Song.”The movie isn’t a full-on spoof, like “A Million Ways To Die in Space.” Instead, we’re actually supposed to get pumped up by the chaotic action, the dazzlingly detailed special effects and the mortal combat with blue-faced villains with bits of circuit board or seaweed stuck to their faces. The comedy is meant to deflate tension that isn’t there in the first place. Writer-director James Gunn keeps pulling the rug out without first bothering to trick anyone into standing on it. It all goes by as slowly as an IRS audit because there’s no suspense: We learn at the outset that the screenwriters will, when stuck, simply dream up some new problem-solving gadget or superpower and give it, unexplained, to whomever needs it. Floating in space for a few seconds will kill you, unless it doesn’t. Grasping an all-powerful golf ball of energy will destroy you, except it won’t. A large weapon will suddenly be tossed to the paws of the raccoon, or the walking tree will form a magical bird’s nest of love around the whole crew to protect them from a crash landing. When in doubt, cut to the potty-mouthed raccoon. Ha, ha, he’s saying “Holy s - - t!” or “Attention, idiots!” Straight out of “Howard the Duck.” The one-liners in “Star Wars,” an obvious inspiration, got laughs while maintaining the illusion that the characters were in danger. Here, a joke about “Footloose” does the opposite. Told that a legendary hero called Kevin Bacon saved the people who had sticks up their butts, Saldana’s character asks, “Who put the sticks up their butts?” It’s supposed to be Drax’s job to be the sitcom cretin here, but in “Guardians of the Galaxy” there’s so much stupid being delivered that everybody has to chip in."
176,ATJ_Doc6_GuardiansOftheGalaxy,ATJ,Sci-Fi,Negative,Guardians of the Galaxy,"It's like the silly, superhero-loving kids goofing off in the back of the classroom looked at The Avengers and X-Men and declared, ""Hey, how hard can it be to save the world? Let's do it too!"" That's how slapdash this kitschy comic-book flick plays on screen. And while it can be a refreshing twist when a film doesn't take itself seriously, the lack of quality blockbusters this summer is no laughing matter. The bright news is that we've landed in outer space — a welcome change in scenery from the usual steel, stale metropolis. That's where we find Peter Quill (Chris Pratt, a very good everyman), flitting around an abandoned planet. He takes off his mask, presses play on a retro Walkman and starts to . . . . dance. To the 1970s hit ""Come and Get Your Love."" Yes, it's that kind of kitsch. The music, as detailed in the prologue, is a track off a soft-rock mixtape given to a young Peter by his cancer-stricken mom. After her death, he dashes outside the hospital grounds and is promptly abducted by aliens. Twenty-six years later, Peter is making a living as a happy-go-lucky scavenger/thief. A plan to steal a powerful glowing sphere goes awry and he lands in an inter-galactic jail. There, he reluctantly aligns with a motley crew of fellow bandits and revenge-seekers: a warrior (Zoë Saldana), a wiseass raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper), a talking tree who only mumbles the sentence ""I am Groot"" (the easiest paycheck Vin Diesel will ever cash) and a brute (Dave Bautista). Together, they try to ensure the destruction–causing gem doesn't fall into nefarious hands. That concludes the rudimentary plot recap, as only Marvel geeks will fully grasp its convoluted play-by-play. Reach down for the popcorn and prepare to miss a barrage of sci-fi villains — played by the likes of Djimon Hounsou, Lee Pace and Josh Brolin — hidden under heavy makeup, as well as a slew of space-aged battles. Those who didn't live-tweet from Comic-Con might find it all a bit exhausting. Perhaps the screenwriters were too busy laughing at their jokes to streamline an accessible narrative? Oh, about those jokes. The misfits hardly miss a chance to toss off a knucklehead one-liner, and a handful of them zing. A running gag about Footloose earns the biggest chuckle. (Want to know what's wrong with that? Nothing!!!!). The irreverent humor is an admittedly original approach to the genre — as is the aforementioned Solid Gold '70s soundtrack. The collateral damage is a total lack of an emotional connection to any of these characters. Saldana's Gamora is covered in green, yet she might as well be a blank canvas. The essential problem here: This B-list adaptation is not quite hilarious enough to be a gut-busting comedy or suspenseful enough to be a sci-fi adventure for the ages. Here's hoping the recently announced sequel truly reaches for the stars."
177,ATJ_Doc7_GuardiansOftheGalaxy,ATJ,Sci-Fi,Negative,Guardians of the Galaxy,"Sci-fi action-comedy. Starring Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana and Lee Pace. Directed by James Gunn. (PG-13. 121 minutes.) ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is pretty much where action movies are these days - a combination of comedy without wit, action without drama and elaborate visuals that are nothing much to look at. That just this little is enough to take ""Guardians"" into the realm of ""not bad"" says more about the state of action than it does about the movie itself. It deals with an effort to save ""the galaxy,"" but this is a notion without emotion. We are shown nothing about this particular galaxy that should make us care whether it gets saved or blown up like Vulcan in ""Star Trek"" (2009). There's no burning reason to root for one set of spaceships over the other. Rather, the mere concept of ""saving the galaxy"" is supposed to engage the audience - for two hours. Yes, there are jokes, but most of these are along the lines of the movie's making fun of itself before we all notice there's nothing to take seriously. In place of wit, ""Guardians"" offers a sort of generalized willingness to be amusing, an atmosphere of high spirits that feels like lots of people pumping air into a tire that has a hole in it. Everyone is clearly working, but nothing is really happening - and yet the effort is so evident that there's an impulse to reward it. As for the three-dimensional visuals, there's little here that couldn't have been rendered just as well in two. In fact, the three dimensions just dim the movie into murkiness, making the experience too much like watching it with sunglasses on. Taking the 3-D glasses off during the close-ups provides the occasional relief. The movie starts with a poorly acted but recognizably human situation, of a little boy saying goodbye to his mother, who is on her deathbed. After she dies, he stumbles out of the hospital, inconsolable. And just as we're forgetting the kind of movie we've signed up for, a flying saucer shows up - as unwelcome and as out of place as any fictional flying saucer in history - and beams the boy on board. Twenty-six years later, Peter (Chris Pratt) is a merry, roving space rogue, a happy-go-lucky fellow flying through the universe, living off his smarts, so it's a wonder he doesn't starve to death. He comes upon a metal orb, about the size of a softball, which apparently everyone wants for some intense yet unspecified purpose. Suffice it to say, it's like the ring in ""The Lord of the Rings"" or the little box that raised hell in the ""Hellraiser"" series. Most of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" consists of Peter trying to hold on to the orb, or trying to get the orb back, or trying to prevent someone from doing something really horrible with it. The actual powers of the orb aren't quite specified. The powers are there for the convenience of the screenwriters, to allow great but not ultimate damage, to make things always desperate but never hopeless, dangerous but still doable."
178,ATJ_Doc8_GuardiansOftheGalaxy,ATJ,Sci-Fi,Positive,Guardians of the Galaxy,"Most of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" consists of Peter trying to hold on to the orb, or trying to get the orb back, or trying to prevent someone from doing something really horrible with it. The actual powers of the orb aren't quite specified. The powers are there for the convenience of the screenwriters, to allow great but not ultimate damage, to make things always desperate but never hopeless, dangerous but still doable. The story begins on Earth, though we are not there for long. It is 1988 and a little boy named Peter Quill sits listening to his Walkman in a hospital hallway, until he's brought in to say goodbye to his dying mother. When she has finally slipped away, he runs outside crying, only to be sucked up by a spacship's tractor beam (or something) and whisked away. The film then jumps ahead some 26 years to the present, where Quill has grown up into a beefy, roguish scavenger (now played by the instantly winning Chris Pratt) who finds a mysterious orb (a pure MacGuffin, until it is not) on an abandoned planet, possession of which immediately thrusts Quill into a cosmic conflict that reaches all the way to the Avengers universe. (Turns out, that's not very far. These two franchises will soon enough be linking together.) What, exactly, that conflict is isn't of much importance. Just know that it involves the mysterious space deity Thanos (Josh Brolin), who was referenced at the end of The Avengers, and his evil ally Ronan (a bellowing Lee Pace), an extremist who wishes to wipe out an empire that has recently struck a peace accord with his own. This orb will do something to advance his cause, destroy a planet or something, so he's pretty bound and determined to get his hands on it. Two of Thanos's ""daughters,"" the genetically enhanced Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and the robotically enhanced Nebula (Karen Gillan), are dispatched to find the thing, while Quill is also pursued by the crook he cheated out of the orb (Michael Rooker) and a pair of bounty hunters, who are a talking raccoon and a talking tree thing. Phew. Did you get all that? The raccoon, named Rocket, is the result of some kind of genetic experiment; he's an odd anomaly who is gawped at wherever he goes. As is Groot, his tree-creature friend. Gunn, anticipating some of our eye-rolling, has placed his film out ahead of the joke, gamely turning a self-skewering eye on the whole thing. Though this is thankfully not an entirely arch, ironic movie, it is amiably aware of its goofier aspects. It invites us in with a warm chuckle, and that affable charm proves hard to resist. As happens with even the best of Marvel's films, the din and flash of Guardians' action-heavy scenes can overwhelm its smaller graces. Gunn creates some arresting images―small aircraft locking together and forming a net to ensnare a much larger ship, a mining colony housed in the head of some enormous, long-dead space entity―but when his camera has to quickly follow along as our heroes do battle, he loses his point of view. Though he always returns us to center with some funny quip or aside (often delivered by Rocket, who is voiced by Bradley Cooper), these jumbled action scenes generally sap the movie of its energy. A lower-fi space comedy is not really the stuff of a studio exec's international box-office dreams, so I understand the need for a lot of big booms. But I wish that in a film that is otherwise so clever, the action was more thoughtful and carefully staged."
179,ATJ_Doc9_GuardiansOftheGalaxy,ATJ,Sci-Fi,Positive,Guardians of the Galaxy,"Hard as it is to believe, within the memory of those still living, Marvel was not always the movie establishment’s billion-dollar behemoth but a scrappy, iconoclastic comic book gadfly. So one of the most pleasant surprises of the altogether pleasant and surprising “Guardians of the Galaxy” is that it takes us back to Marvel’s roots and the subversive satisfactions those early days provided. Yes, “Guardians” cost a reported $170 million, but no one was obsessing about screwing up the franchise here, certainly not co-writer and director James Gunn, whose no-status Troma Entertainment past doesn’t allow anyone to take anything too seriously. Blessed with a loose, anarchic B-picture soul that encourages you to enjoy yourself even when you’re not quite sure what’s going on, the scruffy “Guardians” is irreverent in a way that can bring the first “Star Wars” to mind, in part because it has some of the most unconventional heroes — would you believe a raccoon and a tree? — this side of the Mos Eisley cantina. This Five Against the House ragtag bunch of misfits, rascals and rebels, a kind of garage band of the universe, form an alliance of the dispossessed that makes up in attitude what it lacks in status. It’s easy to understand why Marvel worried so much about this group that it put “From the studio that brought you The Avengers” at the bottom of its advertising. Though its action takes place exclusively in faraway galaxies, “Guardians” begins with a prelude set on Earth in 1988 that explains how a 9-year-old boy ends up in outer space and why his most prized possession is a homemade mix tape of 1970s hits labeled “Awesome Mix #1.” Cut to 26 years later, and that young boy is Peter Quill, a self-assured, self-involved adventurer who hopes humanoids don’t laugh when he calls himself Star Lord. Not to put too fine a point on it, Quill (brought to insouciant comic life by “Parks and Recreation’s” Chris Pratt) is an intergalactic junkman who works for Yondu (Michael Rooker) and his merry band of amoral plunderers. Just at the moment, Quill finds himself on the abandoned planet Morag, trying to get his hands on a certain orb. (It’s always an orb, isn’t it?) Why anyone would want this revolving item isn’t made immediately clear, but it’s soon apparent that lots of other folks covet it too. Top of the list because he is so powerful — and so mean and nasty — is arch-villain Ronan the Accuser (the shape-shifting Lee Pace), who wants it so badly he sends Gamora, a.k.a. the deadliest woman in the galaxy (the always reliable Zoe Saldana), to get it away from Quill by any means necessary. The action switches to the planet Xandar, kind of an outer space version of Earth, where the film’s most outlandish characters, the bounty-hunting team of Rocket and Groot, take aim at the orb as well. Though he’d prefer you didn’t mention it, Rocket is a genetically altered, cybernetically enhanced talking raccoon. Voiced with enormous zest by Bradley Cooper, Rocket is fierce and foul-tempered, the master of take-no-prisoners repartee who, like Howard the Duck before him, is trapped in a world he never made."
180,ATJ_Doc10_GuardiansOftheGalaxy,ATJ,Sci-Fi,Positive,Guardians of the Galaxy,"Finally, some jokey superheroes. Most Marvel movies are enslaved by their own mythology, jealously guarded by fans as zealous and unforgiving as medieval inquisitors in detecting any heretical deviation from orthodoxy. But Guardians of the Galaxy is, even to the faithful, a little-known component of the vast Marvel myth-kitty, so liberties can and have been taken. First appearing in 1969, the Guardians of the Galaxy were always a team of misfits, each of them, in the 31st century, the last of their kind. This film is based mainly on a 2008 iteration of the story — but the director James Gunn (Slither, Super, new to this game on this scale) has seized the chance to make a big in-house production that nonetheless has only tangential connections to the known Marvel universe, creating some great new characters without worrying too much about how they will eventually fit into The Avengers franchise. He’s responding just as much to other movies, most notably the original Star Wars, as to the sacred comic books, and it’s to the film’s advantage. Our hero, Peter Quill, is a big kid, a cheery combo of Hans Solo and Indiana Jones. Abducted from Earth as a boy by piratical aliens, the self-styled “Star-Lord” is now, 25 years later, an intergalactic rascal, thieving away to the sound of Eighties anthems on his treasured Walkman, giving the film a daftly enjoyable vibe, all the way from I’m Not in Love to Spirit in the Sky, not forgetting David Bowie (Moonage Daydream). To play him, Chris Pratt (previously in Parks and Rec on TV, a Navy Seal in Zero Dark Thirty) has impressively revised his chubby physique and his charm holds the whole movie together as both action and comedy. He’s the young Harrison Ford all over again. What more could you ask? To set the ball rolling, Quill steals the Orb, a little metal sphere of immense power and value which our main villain, Ronan, a less asthmatic Darth Vader (Lee Pace), wants to use to destroy the Earth-like planet of Xandar (Earth-like only up to a point since it resembles Dubai). He sends green-skinned assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana) after Quill. The fanboy’s delight, Saldana (Neytiri in Avatar, Uhura in Star Trek) is so slender and long-limbed, she doesn’t especially need a paint job to seem otherworldly, but never mind. Perhaps at some level being a different colour helps superhero fans come to terms with the peculiarity of the opposite sex? That would also explain why the film’s other totty-offer, her step-sister and rival assassin Nebula (Karen Gillan, Amy Pond from Doctor Who) is blue, as well as bald. Inevitably, the pair end up having a ladies-only tussle (as I think it is known?). We’d feel robbed if they didn’t. Gamora soon finds that Quill has already been targeted by a pair of freelance bounty hunters, a super-endearing pair, the R2-D2/C-3PO duo of Guardians. Rocket Raccoon is — but you guessed it? — a raccoon that’s been genetically altered and cybernetically enhanced to be a lethal warrior with a snitty attitude. “Ain’t no thing like me except me,” he says grumpily. Tricky and fast-talking, Rocket is brilliantly voiced by Bradley Cooper: great casting. But so was choosing Vin Diesel as the voice of his sidekick Groot: a tree that moves and talks a bit. Actually all Groot says is “I am Groot”, in Vin Diesel’s deep, cultured voice, always a surprising production from a muscleman; here he gives such different inflections to these three words that they mean whatever he wants them to mean. Guardians of the Galaxy is quick, knowing and indulgent about what its audience will enjoy most. I’ve rarely seen a preview audience as responsive and delighted, so much on the same page, as at the screening I attended. The retro design is great, the CGI well-integrated, the 3D effective. Star Wars has been so zingily spoofed and revamped here that it’s going to be much harder for the real thing to make a convincing comeback."
181,AKA_Doc1_Encanto,AKA,Comedy,Positive,Encanto,"The time is now to see Lin Manuel Miranda's animated musical ""Encanto. Set in Colombia, this tale of a magical Latino family whose magic is fading is the frontrunner to win the Oscar as best animated film, but not on looks alone.
It's the sound of ""Encanto"" that has made this burst of Disney enchantment a cultural phenomenon. The film's soundtrack of eight songs from the hip-hop genius of ""Hamilton"" just knocked Adele off the top of the Billboard charts. And the album's breakout dance ditty, ""We Don't Talk About Bruno,"" is selling more than the juggernaut ""Let It Go"" from ""Frozen.""
""Encanto"" caps a hell of a year for Miranda, who also did the songs for the animated ""Vivo,"" saw his Broadway success ""In the Heights"" turned into a fab movie musical the public foolishly ignored, and made a smash screen directing debut with ""Tick, Tick . . . Boom"" with an awards-bound Andrew Garfield in the role of the late ""Rent"" composer Jonathan Larsen.
""Bruno"" is indisputably one of the best movie tunes ever, though the Academy inexplicably chose not to consider it for the best song Oscar, placing its focus on the soft ballad ""Dos Oruguitas."" If Miranda takes the gold statue for that one, he'll become an EGOT, one of the rare creative artists to win an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony. Consider it done.
To experience ""Encanto"" again or for the first time reveals Miranda as a pioneer in taking music to the next level on stage and screen. All credit to screenwriter Charise Castro Smith and her co-directors Byron Howard and Jared Bushda (""Zootopia""), but it's the Miranda songs, in English and Spanish, that have struck a nerve with audiences.
In the first song, ""The Family Madrigal,"" we meet the clan. Having fled violence in their native land, the displaced Madrigals build Casita, a house with a mind of its own (those flapping shutters!) set in the Colombian hillside town of Encanto. The Madrigals are all possessed of special powers, from shapeshifting to healing, except for Mirabel (voiced by Stephanie Beatriz).
In ""Waiting on a Miracle,"" Mirabel sings of her loneliness when the family takes a group photo without her. But it's Mirabel who steps up when Abuela Alma (Maria Cecilia Botero) reveals that the candle that conveys magic powers is in danger of being snuffed out.
The rest of the songs range beautifully from the tender guitar strains of ""Dos Oruguitas"" (Two Caterpillars) in which Abuela tells how she lost her husband and first received the miracle to the soul-stirring ""Colombia, Mi Encanto,"" which celebrates community as a life force.
Don't look here for a Prince Charming or a hissable villains. Family is this movie's superpower and when those caterpillars morph into yellow butterflies like something out of the pages of Colombian author Gabriel Garcia Marquez, ""Encanto"" spins visual miracles. But the real magic is in Miranda, who gives this spellbinder a heart that sings and a spirit that soars."
182,AKA_Doc2_Encanto,AKA,Comedy,Negative,Encanto,"Billed as the 60th feature from Disney Animation Studios, Encanto is a pseudo-fairy tale about a family with supernormal abilities. Many people say Disney is currently all bad. Some say Disneys always been bad. Spiritual teacher Rudolf Steiner said something to the effect that Disney animators would have enormous karma to pay in their next lives due to making animals look stupid. Who knows? Disney does have the occasional good product, and Disneys Encanto both shamelessly pander exclusively to the Latino community, Coco was enchanting, but Encanto (which means enchanting) is nowhere near as good. Now, Im actually a believer in the concept of other time-spaces and alternative dimensions. Its been said that certain stories filtrate into our dimension from other dimensions, like Star Wars, and Lord Of The Rings. You might think, oh sure, there was a land called Middle Earth that had a place called Mordor with a 20-foot giant spider running around eating goblinssurrrre. That happened. I get it. But movies like Contact, Avatar, The Matrix, and a slew of movies by now have expanded our ways of thinking about separate realities. All of which is to say that while Encanto might also appear to be other worldly, it comes off more as a hodgepodge of cobbled-together concepts, half-baked ideas, unoriginal, recycled fantasy effects, and has nothing to do with other dimensions but is most likely a representative of Magical Realism, which is inherently devoid of any kind of spiritual sustenance. Its got few of the underlying laws, logic, and wisdom that applies to true fairy tales, myths, and legends. More on this later. Mirabel, with no powers, is of course the heroine who saves the day. But does she go on a heros journey to find herself? A true heros journey to find ones true power (often represented by gold in fairy tales) requires danger, loss, suffering and sacrifice. Mirabel basically just snoops around the casa, discovering clues about whats ailing the casa. Shes never really in any danger; mostly its finally getting hold of the familys long-lost pariah Uncle Bruno (John Leguizamo), who disappeared after all his supernormally generated pre-cognitive bad-luck prophecies started coming true and vexing the rest of the family. Theres a whole musical number about We dont talk about Bruno. Brunos been hiding in the casas attic, walls, and crawl-spaces with the rats for decades. Thats very uncompassionate for a family of supernormal royals. Its eventually revealed that everyones suffering from, among other things, not feeling worthy enough due to grandmas overbearing personality, outsized expectations, withholding of affection and compliments, and tendency to shame. This would effectively make her the storys villainess, but she isnt really, which is yet another source of the overall rudderlessness and lack of adherence to the laws of fairy tales, which is that there must be evil, and evil must be overcome. Mirabels superpower would appear to be that of family shrink. She facilitates some family therapy. And hugging. And Latin dancing. Annnnnnd. scene. Thats it? Yup."
183,AKA_Doc3_Encanto,AKA,Comedy,Positive,Encanto,"Disney used to be best known for its childrens animation. But over the last decade the House of Mouse has become the House of Hulk. Princesses and neotenous animal companions havent vanished. The film, which features a family with special magical abilities, merges MCU superhero tropes with Disneys animated loving heroines to create a kind of cross-genre company hybrid. But Encanto also gives the superhero genre a good talking (or singing) to, questioning its motives and its morals in the name of more family-oriented Disney fare. Encantos critique of superheroes is in part in line with the MCUs own effort to rethink the genre. Encanto fits neatly beside the newer MCU offerings. Set in a Colombian village, the film is about the family Madrigal, (almost) all of whom have extraordinary gifts which look a lot like superpowers. Mother Julieta (Angie Cepeda) heals people with her cooking; sister Luisa (Jessica Darrow) has super strength which allows her to carry piles of donkeys on her back; another sister Isabela (Diane Guerrero) makes flowers grow everywhere. Others in the family can control weather, tell the future, talk to animals, and shape shift. The Latina and Latino heroes use their gifts to help and protect the other villages, in line with that old Spider-Man dictum, with great power comes great responsibility. The one exception is the protagonist Mirabel, voiced by Stephanie Beatriz. Like everyone else in her family, Mirabel was supposed to receive powers at a coming-of-age ceremony. But for some reason, the ceremony didnt work. Now shes the one Madrigal without any particular abilities. Worse, when the Madrigals magic starts to fade and cracks appear in their magic house, Abuela (María Cecilia Botero), the leader of the Madrigals, blames Mirabel. If this were an MCU film, Mirabel would gain her own superpowers (Flight? Superspeed? Spreading love and understanding?) and save the day. Instead, Encanto is about how Mirabel is heroic precisely because she doesnt have any gift. Luisa with her super strength feels she has to carry every weight, literally and figuratively, or she wont be a good person. Perfect Isabela wants to create weird cactuses and vines and prickly things but worries that if she doesnt just make pretty flowers, no one will love her. With no abilities of her own, Mirabel is the ideal person to teach her family that they dont need to be powerful and perfect to be valued. Encanto isnt so sure. In the film, Abuelas focus on power and abilities and specialness and saving everyone doesnt heal suffering, but perpetuates it. The magic house was always built on a weak foundation, because trusting in power is a kind of weakness. Its only when Abuela stops trying to save the villagers and lets them help her that she gets a house solid enough to hold a family together. Real empowerment, Mirabel insists, comes from loving and helping one another, not from magic strength or a magic shield. The person who most needs to learn this lesson is Abuela herself. Thats when she was given her miracle; a candle that burns eternally giving her children and their children magical abilities."
184,AKA_Doc4_Encanto,AKA,Comedy,Negative,Encanto,"The Family Madrigal lives in an encanto, an enchanted place, as Mirabel explains in her opening song  introducing the cast, the child chorus, and more details than a six-week history course crammed into six minutes. Happily, all of the Madrigal kids and grandchildren have a magical ability, well, except Mirabel. Shed be okay with this  even their sentient house Casita doesnt mind  if it werent for the constant reminders she was inexplicably passed over. When her cousin Antonio becomes the first to receive a gift after her failure, Mirabel notices the candle empowering the encanto is beginning to falter during the ensuing celebration. Their abuela (grandmother) Alma assures both family and friends there is no such issue, the declaration quietly suggesting Mirabels dire warning is born of jealousy  the beginning of cracks showing in not only the Casita but in the Family Madrigal itself. Similar to other Disney fare where filmmakers explore and embrace a region for a feature presentation, Encanto is constructed around Colombian customs and ideals. Including eight original bilingual songs written by Lin-Manuel Miranda and a score composed by Germaine Franco, the story is born of tragedy, sorrow, and triumph in how the Madrigal family came to be. While these are the seeds of the back story, it in no way informs upon what the movie is actually about or the odd direction it takes. As told by a character who would be relegated to the background in any other version of a film such as this, is the music, colorful culture, and mysteries within enough to lure audiences into theaters? The time period is non-specific, but there are suggestions it stems from the Thousand Days War, a conflict begun in 1899 and the cause of many Colombians fleeing their homes to survive a political genocide (sorry, kids; it happens). The repeatedly referenced faceless riders remembered in Almas grief are given no additional explanation or consideration; this works against the narrative because the film doesnt really have a traditional villain even after countless cues and suggestions there absolutely should be. With a vibrant score suggesting hidden dangers which never materialize, the final cut feels undercut. Its as if a more exciting story was muted to make room for too much of the family ensemble until its all that remained, leaving Mirabel appearing to apologize in advance on every advertising poster. For Encanto, however, it feels as if the story was either made to fit the songs afterward or the story was changed after the songs were made. This kind of thing happens in development all the time. Encanto is at the top of its game with the rapid-fire song sequences, but the in-betweens feel forced or dull in comparison, certainly not what was promised and falling flat rather than being triumphant. The repeated hints at a darker or more dangerous story come off as pure bait-and-switch, unfulfilling at best and boring at worst but hey, nice songs, though. Theres a good message here, but its muddled with suggestions something more going on that isnt. The truth is worse than a Disney villain: its gaslighting by and from people who were assumed trustworthy or having ones back. Villains lie to heroes and heroines all the time  its what they do, after all  but how does one forgive a knowingly false accusation and turning everyone against them with all the hurt that would cause? If the filmmakers had embraced this as the actual theme from the beginning, itd have made more sense (and been a completely different movie), but did the filmmakers even realize what theyd done in the end? "
185,AKA_Doc5_Encanto,AKA,Comedy,Positive,Encanto,"The latest stop on Disney Animation Studios' world tour, following Raya and the Last Dragon's riff on Fantasy Asia earlier this year, is Colombia. The most famous work of art to come out of Colombia (and a strong contender for the designation of greatest novel ever written) is Gabriel Garcia Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude, and the studio's new film Encanto pays homage to that magical realist masterwork with its story of a multi-generational family blessed by wonderful enchantments. It's hard to miss the rhyme between ""Encanto,"" which is both the title of the film and a word often used by its characters to refer to the miracle that made a home for them deep in the mountains, and ""Macondo,"" the town founded by Marquez's unforgettable Buendia family in the middle of the jungle. Of course, One Hundred Years of Solitude delves deeply into sex, politics, and the bloodstained history of imperialism in Latin America  none of which are quite suitable subjects for a Disney kids' movie. So for its structure and rhythm, Encanto leans on more familiar U.S. media touchstones. Like the X-Men, almost every member of the Madrigal family is blessed with their own unique power: Luisa is strong enough to lift anything, while Isabela can make beautiful flowers bloom all around her. But like The Umbrella Academy, the story of Encanto focuses on the only family member who doesn't have an evident superpower: Mirabel, the younger sister of Luisa and Isabela who desperately wants to prove she can support her family and community just as well as they can. Her lack of power seems to suggest that the family's enchantment is fading, so Mirabel decides to try investigating the source of this decline and see if it can be fixed. Maribel embarks on a search for her prodigal uncle Bruno, who exiled himself from the family after his precognitive visions were dismissed as self-fulfilling doomsaying instead of helpful warnings against coming troubles. Mirabel's quest to find the truth involves reaching out to various other family members for help as well. Through charming songs, we learn that Luisa is starting to crack under the pressure of always needing to be strong, while Isabela actually possesses the spirit of a colorful, rebel artist beneath her golden child facade. Encanto is directed by Byron Howard and Jared Bush, but the film's original songs were composed by Hamilton maestro Lin-Manuel Miranda. Together with Netflix's Vivo and Tick, Tick...Boom!, that makes Encanto the third film to heavily feature Miranda's touch in as many months (to say nothing of In the Heights earlier this year). It's no crime to be such a prolific artist, especially with COVID-19 delaying releases, but it also doesn't feel like the Encanto soundtrack is Miranda's best work. The songs are breezy and fun, they communicate the character beats they need to, but they probably won't be stuck in your head for days afterward. It's not easy squeezing a multi-generational magical epic into an hour and a half, and some gaps in Encanto's mythology might leave you scratching your head (if it's true that Mirabel doesn't have a power of her own, then why does she seem to possess such a unique level of affinity and control over the family's living house?). But a smiling tale about familial reconciliation and learning to see your relatives for who they are rather than who you wish they were is never unwelcome. In this story, sometimes families condemned to 100 years of solitude do get a second chance on Earth."

It is colorful and exciting and funny and warm-hearted and, something harder to find, it is also wise. As we learn in one of Lin-Manuel Mirandas bright, energetic songs early in the film, Mirabel (sweetly voiced by Stephanie Beatriz) loves her family and is very proud that her mother has healing powers and her aunt has superstrength.

Other family members can understand animals, predict the future, or shape-shift. Mirabels sisters superpower just seems to be perfection. The Madrigal family has a rich, storied history. When her grandparents were young, they fled their home. Her grandfather was killed by the people they were trying to escape. But her grandmother, clutching her baby, was blessed with the powers to help her community survive. A generation later, the family is the center of that now-settled community, living in a home with its own magical powers and personality. That house, communicating with flipping floor tiles and steps that slip into slides and creating dazzling new rooms to recognize each family members powers, is one of the movies highlights. The family has a ceremony when each member receives his or her magical powers. But for some reason, Mirabels never arrived. She even wears glasses (the first Disney lead character to do so) to show just how ordinary and relatable she is. Unexpectedly, the magic the family has counted on and taken pride in  and taken for granted  seems to begin to be dissolving. And that is when the girl who does not think she is special begins to understand that she, and only she, has the qualities the family needs to keep them together. That means adventure. It also means learning some lessons about how even the most loving, high-performing, and functional families have to deal with secrets and sometimes painful and scary truths. This insight is gently but thoughtfully explored, understanding that sometimes it is especially difficult to be honest with happy families for fear of letting the others down. But when family policy is We dont talk about Bruno, it is time for someone to ask why. And when we do not leave room for family members to be less than perfect, it is time to tell them it is okay if they make mistakes and in fact if they dont, its a good idea to tell them to make some. Families will enjoy Encanto but what may be more meaningful are the conversations we have afterward. "
187,AKA_Doc7_Encanto,AKA,Comedy,Positive,Encanto,"Its been a vintage year for cinema in three fields especially: musicals, animation, and things involving Lin-Manuel Miranda. Encanto, the 60th feature from Walt Disney Animation Studios, ticks all of the boxes above, which arguably makes it the most 2021 film of 2021. Inarguably, its an out-and-out delight. Miranda, the never knowingly under-occupied creator of In the Heights and Hamilton, has composed a suite of new Latin and hip-hop-flavoured songs for this lusciously rendered, shrewdly introspective swashbuckling adventure, about a young woman who feels surplus to community requirements. Her name is Mirabel Madrigal (Stephanie Beatriz), and she lives in a village nestled deep in the Colombian mountains, where an enchanted candle grants every member of her family a civically useful superpower when they come of age. The place was founded by Mirabels redoubtable grandmother Alma (María Cecilia Botero), a civil war widow whose traumatic past also furnished her with the magical gifts for which her family have come to be renowned. Mirabels sisters Isabela (Diane Guerrero) and Luisa (Jessica Darrow) can respectively make flowers bloom at will and shoulder extraordinary weights  one glides around in a Fragonard flurry of blossom, while the other could rival Obelixs menhir-lugging vigour. Her mother Julieta (Angie Cepeda), meanwhile, can rustle up regional delicacies with healing powers. But when the time came for Mirabels own blessing to emerge, the candle demurred, and now shes left wondering what on earth shes good for, while her relatives rearrange, sustain and beautify the township. At least Mirabel has the support of her house  which, by the way, is sentient, and as much a family pet as it is a place of residence. Encantos animation is dazzling in all sorts of ways, with technical effects and flights of creative fancy that would have been unimaginable even a year ago, particularly during the musical numbers. (Surface Pressure, sung by the much-put-upon Luisa, is a standout.) But imbuing a building with the personality of a hundred-ton puppy is perhaps the most impressive visual feat here. How on earth do you make a staircase show enthusiasm, or a window express sympathy, or a tiled floor chivvy its occupants along as if its nuzzling at their heels? Encanto does all of this, and makes it look easy  since the animators ensure the emotions themselves can be read with ease. So when the candles flame begins to gutter and the familys powers start to wane, its deeper into the house that Mirabel must go, in order to find out whats amiss. For once, the quest to set things right doesnt involve an outward journey: instead, it plays out in the buildings network of cobwebby passageways and Tardis-like secret chambers. That setting perhaps robs Encanto of the grand emotional swell of, say, Tangled or Moana, but it aligns cleverly with the storys theme  even families that seem to be thriving need to tend to their foundations  while giving Mirabels adventure an Indiana Jones-like quality that feels novel within this particular field. Disney Animations 2021 crop  this, plus Raya and the Last Dragon  shows the same thrilling breadth of ambition. At a time when the corporations live-action output keeps doubling down on the franchise grind, here from just over the garden fence is a lesson in storytelling that feels at once elegantly classical and zingily fresh."
188,AKA_Doc8_Encanto,AKA,Comedy,Negative,Encanto,"Disneys Encanto is so shoddily engineered that I picture marketing executives sitting around telling one another, Meh, its for the Latino market. It doesnt have to be that good. And so it isnt. A thin story, dull characters, endlessly regurgitated gags, and a general air of pointlessness dog this fantasy about life in an enchanted house in an unspecified Latin country (said to be Colombia in publicity materials). Billed as the 60th feature from Disney Animation Studios, this is bottom-of-the barrel stuff from the Mouse House. Lin-Manuel Miranda, who contributes a slate of thuddingly mediocre songs, is now nearly seven years past the triumphant premiere of Hamilton (more time than passed between A Hard Days Night and Let It Be), and his career is drifting further and further off track. Mirabel (voiced by Stephanie Beatriz) is a tweener and the sole member of the Madrigal family not to be blessed with a magical power. She tries to be upbeat about her fabulous relatives but understandably feels left out as they prance around showing off their magic tricks. What did she do to deserve being relegated to second-class status? Nothing, as it turns out. In effect, la familia Madrigal are royals who have been blessed with a completely unearned privilege thanks to a magical candle that intervened to save the life of the matriarch Abuela Alma (Maria Cecilia Botero) two generations back. Unlike other Disney royal families, though, this one seems to have no sense of noblesse oblige, and the Madrigals spend their days partying and goofing off, which doesnt endear them to the audience much. So youre unlikely to care when things start to come apart. Mirabel discovers that the magical house in which everyone lives is cracking, symbolizing a possible end to the familys magical era, but that brings up a major script problem. What exactly are the stakes here? This family of spoiled layabouts might lose their magic and have to live like the rest of us? Yawn. They didnt do anything either to merit or to show gratitude for what they have. The movie gets stuck for a good long while marveling at all of these characters while Mirabel tries not to be sad about being left out, and it badly needs some forward movement that never really happens. Instead, it keeps pausing for clunky production numbers that explode with scene changes and dance moves but dont advance the plot. For instance, a confessional by Luisa is about how, despite being famously strong, shes actually deeply neurotic and fearful, and this unattractive character sings it unpleasantly. At least Mirabel goes on a heros quest to find herself? Not really. Instead, she spends the entire movie hanging around the house. The key to the mystery lies chiefly with the familys pariah uncle Bruno (John Leguizamo), who became an outcast when his prophecies of bad news started coming true. And, hey, hes wacky! Check out how wacky he is! Directed by Jared Bush and Byron Howard, co-directed by Castro Smith, and written by all of the above plus three more writers with story credits, the movie is equally awful whether its trying to be funny or exciting or mysterious or cute. And wheres it all leading? The final act amounts to an injunction to everyone to hug it out. Thats it? Thats it. Disneys worst movies are sometimes derided as mere thrill rides. Theres no danger of anyone saying that about this one."

Mirabels grandma is the formidable matriarch Abuela (voiced by María Cecilia Botero), who lost her husband many years ago, and for whom this magical house was mysteriously created at the time, apparently rising up in defiance of this great sadness. And all of her children and grandchildren turn out each to have a magic power, of which Abuela is intensely proud. Mirabels mum Julieta (Angie Cepeda) can heal people with her cooking, and I guess only a pedant would ask why she doesnt heal Mirabels eyesight. Mirabels sister Isabella (Diane Guerrero) is a perfect Instagram-style princess who can make flowers bloom with her sheer loveliness. Her other sister Luisa (Jessica Darrow) has super-strength and can lift buildings. Her aunt Pepa (Carolina Gaitán) can control the weather and cousin Dolores (Adassa) has super-hearing. This is a pretty heteronormative household but her cousin Camilo (Rhenzy Feliz) can shapeshift because he doesnt know who he is yet. But wait. There is one person who doesnt have a gift and that is poor Mirabel herself. Yet when a sudden, terrible crisis occurs and all the members of the Madrigal family look like losing their powers, it is Mirabel who must step up and save everyone and everything  by tracking down the familys missing uncle Bruno (John Leguizamo) whose own gift of prophecy allowed him to foresee this awful eventuality and Mirabels own part in the fightback. And  well  maybe this family of fanatical overachievers need to see how their supernatural superiority is a neurotic group symptom of unhappiness. Maybe they need humble Mirabel to bring them to a new enlightenment. So are their gifts a good thing or a bad thing? They didnt seem like such a bad thing in the films opening two acts: these gifts seemed to be part of everyones innocent well-being, abilities lightly and modestly worn. And as the rescuing of these powers is the plot motivation, it is an uncomfortable turnaround for these powers to be represented as something to be opposed or surmounted  a paradox which the film does not acknowledge or resolve  especially as we get a pretty broad hint that they may in any case be magically restored. This is a flavourless, unsatisfying film."
190,AKA_Doc10_Encanto,AKA,Comedy,Negative,Encanto,"Despite my fervent hopes, Disneys Encanto didnt quite cast a spell on me. As much as I love movies about misfits who ultimately find their purpose, as fascinated as I am by Latin American cultures and as desperate as I am for a movie to transport me to a place I clearly will not be travelling to any time soon, I was disappointed. Its odd, given the people involved, and the research that went into a solid idea. Co-director Byron Howard made Zootopia and Tangled, and Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote eight songs for the animated musical. A team travelled to Colombia in 2018 to get a feel of the location where the story is set. Encanto is centred around the idea of exploring the complexities within a multigenerational family. Although the movie is suffused with Colombian textures, adding punches of magic realism into the plot, the story is too confusing to take away any clear images or messages. A few days after watching it, Im hard-pressed to remember a particular sequence that was breathtaking. I cant even think of a standout Miranda song that captured my attention enough to hum a hook. Encanto opens with Mirabel Madrigal (Stephanie Beatriz) introducing us to her extended family. Theres the matriarch, Alma (Maria Cecilia Botero), lovingly called abuela (grandmother), Mirabels older siblings Luisa (the strong one) and Isabela (the perfect one with a floral touch), cousins Dolores (who hears everything), Camilo (the shape shifter) and Antonio (the one about to be blessed with a gift). Then theres her mom and dad, aunt and uncles  and they all live together in the magical Madrigal casa.
But what is your gift? the kids in the town ask Mirabel.
Encanto introduces the Madrigals, a compelling and complicated extended family who live in a wondrous and charmed place in the mountains of Colombia. Disney Turns out, Mirabel doesnt have a gift, which makes her an oddity within her family. She tries to make up for her perceived shortcomings by being a people pleaser. On the day that five-year-old Antonio takes part in the special ceremony meant to reveal his gift, Mirabel sees cracks in their magical house. When she tries to alert her family, they dont pay her attention. In fact, her beloved abuela tells Mirabel to stay out of the way. However, Mirabel grows more certain of what she saw, and the repercussions it could have on her familys powers. She sets out to unravel the mystery behind a vision her Uncle Bruno (John Leguizamo) experienced before he disappeared. Solving that mystery will help the Madrigals keep their magic alive. If the plot had stuck to the magical Madrigals and Mirabel as the odd-girl-out, together facing some kind of external challenge, it would have been an easier narrative to follow. But the filmmakers make the tension come from within this multigenerational family. And this is where things get confusing.Theres an origin story as to how the Madrigals got their magic, which has to do with a community exodus. Why  this exodus happens, and how that results in the Madrigals receiving their gift, isnt fully explained. And so theres a lack of clarity when it comes to understanding the exact threat to the Madrigal clan. Why is the gift of magic too hard a cross for the Madrigals to bear? Why were they chosen in the first place? The questions kept me from being immersed in the narrative. This isnt to say the story doesnt move you in parts. Theres a warmth in Mirabels mothers ability to heal through her food  thats a gift many people can intimately understand. Despite those moments of affection, however, Encanto ends up being overwrought rather than enchanting."
191,JLU_Doc1_JamesBondCasinoRoyale,JLU,Action,Negative,"James Bond, Casino Royale","Is this where we are at? Is this the state of the nation? Bring back the cold war and let's dump this Bond into the rubbish bin of America's world paranoia. Because that's whets happened, Bond has been hijacked by the Yankee Doodle dandy with a cob on! In every Bond from on her Majesty's secret service to Golden Eye there has been more than a passing nod in the direction of the Fleming novels, and although the plot of the film sticks tersely to the novels outline, its modern interpretation is like fitting a square peg into a round hole. Craig's bond is the proverbial hammer, for whom every problem seems to be a nail, this was a real chance to expose an audience to Flemings insight into the Bond character, his reasons for returning to the service are complicated and full of pathos, made all the more acute by Vespers suicide. Now i'm not one of those nuts that says a film should be like the book, not in the least, they are two distinct and separate forms and should do what they do best. My complaint here is that this is Bond on the tin and some silly Mission Impossible, Ethan Hunt caricature of an English Spy inside. Campbell directs Craig like he directs Stallone in Vertical limits, wooden, without skill and not an ounce of sympathy. The Fleming bond even at this early stage was not the two dimensional blunt instrument that is cast here, his emasculation at the hands of Le Chiffre was a moment of brief respite for me. I had thought of doing that to myself in the second half of the film using my bare hands and a bag of Minstrels! But the agony continued! In fact had Campbell bothered to gain an insight from the novel, from which he stole the best line ""The bitch is dead now."" (of course he interpreted it ""The bitch is dead!"" which makes it sound very different to the British core of this character, much more like a moment from a Tarrantino script) the Yankeefication of Bond is an issue that really should be dealt with, its not that I don't like these bludgeoning action heroes from across the pond, I love them, grew up on them, but why oh why does it have to pervade every nuance of what is, essentially, a very English hero? And indeed a very English idea of heroism. This unique texture has been lost in this Bond, replaced by action sequences (That of course you expect to be very good) and the worse game of cards ever filmed!! No panache, no style, not an ounce of performance. One of the core themes removed from Bond is his loss of innocence, Fleming's novel saw a dedicated young man struggle for what is right in the world, win, then ultimately lose through a process of torture and suicide. The key is that he rejoins MI6 not because he is embittered or broken but because the world appears as it really is; dangerous, full of hopes and disappointment. The film has Bonds character start at thick and end at thicker. What ever revelation that Vesper might have brought is lost because of where this Bond started the film. I mean Campbell's idea of culture is to drop a Venetian building into the sea? Where is the finesse? It seems as though along with his Bond, even Campbell gave up hope at the end and started to pull the plug, flushing the whole sorry affair into a very deep murky water. Lets get back to the core of Bond, which is unquestionably The Best Of British, its Roger Moore leaping off a mountain with a union jack parachute, its Sean Connery sitting at the card table in Thunderball, and of course that very 'cunninlinguist' Brosnan allowing his masculinity to be 'PC'-fied. It is not a flickering 'Last Action Hero' muscle- bound- robot with the acting ability of a spade blowing up everything that moves (and a few that don't) Let the Americans do that with their hero's, they're better at it, and it makes more sense."
192,JLU_Doc2_JamesBondCasinoRoyale,JLU,Action,Negative,"James Bond, Casino Royale","Give or take the odd Octopussy, I suppose, like all of us, I've pretty much seen them all. My first, memorably - you never forget your first - was a rerun of Thunderball at a Gaumont in Birmingham, which in my memory was in the process of being demolished. I'd have been eight, and the most dramatic big screen extravanganza I'd seen previously was Swiss Family Robinson, so Bond came with something of the force of revelation; I went home to re-enact Sean Connery's underwater fight with Largo's men with a single rubber-suited Action Man in the bath. My first on its proper release, not long after, was The Man with The Golden Gun, complete with Lulu's soundtrack. I had nightmares for a while about Christopher Lee's Scaramanga, and recall trying to join in with playground discussions about the voluptuous merits of Britt Eklund's Mary Goodnight in relation to Pussy Galore, a name whose reference was possibly still beyond me. I was, in any case, hooked, for a long time secretly thinking Roger Moore was the best Bond, a fact which would have dismayed my Dad who properly held out for the more spartan virtues of Sean Connery, and my Mum, who would sometimes make an impassioned, slightly flushed argument for the missed opportunity that was George Lazenby. Anyhow, with some of this in mind, I went along to the Odeon Leicester Square on Friday night for the first screening of the new Bond, the Daniel Craig Bond. Most of the other balding, paunchy one-timeschoolboys in the queue seemed to have a similar not quite cynical sense of expectation. There'd be chases, and gadgets and gags - the last Bond line I'd heard in the cinema, was also one of the best: Pierce Brosnan, on the Bosphorus with Dr Christmas Jones at the end of The World is not Enough: 'I've always wanted to have Christmas in Turkey. 'Hopes were high. If nothing else, there would be John Barry's theme, which, as I joined the line to have my mobile phone confiscated - an emasculation I could never imagine 007 submitting to - was already dun-de-dunning in my head. The word before this screening was that Daniel Craig's Bond would be a purist's Bond, dirtier and grittier than recent smoothies. Casino Royale was the first of Fleming's books, and the only one, for contractual reasons, never previously filmed except in the Peter Sellers spoof. It would return James to his roots, the cold-blooded killer, the ex-wartime Commander, before fast women and invisible cars turned his head. It begins, after a title sequence involving the designs on the back of playing cards, and diamonds coming out of guns and writhing croupiers in silhouette - you know - in exactly that retro spirit, apparently in black and white, in Prague: Bond is in the shadows surprising a double agent rifling through a filing cabinet. Craig had effectively auditioned for Bond in Layer Cake, in which he played a cocaine dealer out of his depth, and we cut to what looks like a scene from that film - the very un-Bond-like graphic violence of Craig murdering an informer in a white-tiled public lavatory, holding the man's head underwater in a cheap sink. This, we are led to understand, was Bond's first kill, the most traumatic, his 007 status still pending, before the quips set in. His second, of the double agent by the filing cabinet, with a silencer, is more straightforward, and prompts a wry smile. That grainy preamble over, Craig is in colour and up and running - straight through a staged cobra and mongoose fight in a market in Madagascar, over the odd trashed car, past plenty of startled villagers carrying unlikely dry goods, up some serious scaffolding scattering hard-hatted building workers, and on to a crane tower over the impossibly blue ocean in pursuit of a scar-faced villain with a bag of explosives. Who wants backstreet grittiness when you can have fights with guns that run out of bullets at opportune moments at high altitude? Craig is the first Bond since Connery who looks more than capable of doing his own stunts, he runs like a streetfighter, falls credibly from great heights and has been practicing his free running. This is pre-Q Bond; the closest he gets to a gadget is a decent mobile phone; he spends a good deal of his time chasing fast cars on foot in a manner Roger Moore would have deemed far too keen; to start with he doesn't even seem to have his own motor. Worse still, he hasn't yet earned Barry's theme, except in odd mangled chords. The best preface to Casino Royale is Simon Winder's wonderful book The Man Who Saved Britain, out in paperback to coincide with the release of the film. It's the comic history of an obsession with Bond, both his own and our own - an unravelling of all the curious hang-ups about posh drinks and hat-throwing and casual misogyny that takes in the demise of imperial ambition, post-war austerity and Fleming's taste for torture. It's a brilliant deconstruction of those staples of British life that Paul Johnson, writing long ago of Bond in the New Statesmen, denounced as 'sex, snobbery and sadism', (this before Johnson moved to the Spectator and discovered the pleasures of the same).You rather wish Cubby Broccoli and the rest had studied Winder's memoir before embarking on Casino Royale. One of the things his book argues well is that the explosion of a gas tanker is no real substitute for vaguely plausible plotting or some notion of contemporary relevance - a key element in Fleming's thrillers was his sharp move from villainous former Nazis, to Cold War paranoia. In attempting to flesh out the idea of Daniel Craig's Bond as backstory to subsequent Bonds - trying on his first dinner jacket for size, tripping over his chat-up lines to Eva Green's gorgeous Vesper Lynd, replying when asked if he wants his martini shaken or stirred, 'Do I look like I give a damn?' - almost everything else seems to have gone out of the window (along with various not particularly sinister villains).I'm quite happy for Bond to live in a continuous present, but the time frame of the film is perplexing. After the grainy Fifties Prague opening, there is the predictable Seventies, Whicker's World rush of destinations, taking in Uganda, Madagascar, the Bahamas and Venice, while Bond, who we are presumably supposed to believe we have never come across before, suggests from time to time that he is in 2006. Judi Dench as M, seems more than usually unsure about the wisdom of her role or which era she's in. She speaks at one point of her nostalgia for the Cold War, before outlining the plot, such as it is, which involves an attempt to manipulate the stock market using terrorism, bringing in the first and only reference to 9/11. You don't expect Casino Royale to be 24, quite, or Bond to be Jack Bauer, but it seems bizarre to be employing a mix of Albanian and Swiss and African and Italian financial terrorists when you might think there are more real current fears to explore. Director Martin Campbell is also unsure about how much of the glamour of violence he wants to strip back. There are unusual 007 moments in which Bond lets us know he's human, sitting soaking in the shower in his blood-drenched dinner suit comforting Vesper after she has helped him kill a man; or, oddly, screaming in pain. Raymond Chandler praised the original book of Casino Royale for its brutal description of torture, exposing genre-fiction to a new realism. The scene that Chandler singled out is reproduced here, with Bond tied naked on the frame of a chair while his exposed scrotum is whipped with a knotted rope. Craig is, not surprisingly, in more obvious pain than any previous Bond , but having put him there, the only way to remove him is through a comically unexplained ambush; by the next scene, like the Bonds of old, he is recuperating by the Italian lakes, his tenderized tackle magically restored.  The problem with making Bond more real, is that everything around him then seems even more fake than usual. Craig, always a charismatic presence, often looks unsettled by that dislocation; his sex scenes are more energetic than those of his predecessors but even less convincing; he is hardly allowed any comedy. As a result, by the end of a curiously back-to-front film, when he finally gets his theme tune and introduces himself - 'Bond. James Bond' - he, like the creaky franchise itself, seems profoundly unsure whether he is coming or going."
193,JLU_Doc3_JamesBondCasinoRoyale,JLU,Action,Negative,"James Bond, Casino Royale","The James Bond films have been with us for more than 40 years, for better or worse. They are not so much a barometer of popular moods but of the thinking of a layer of mercenary film studio executives attempting to gauge or guess at popular moods. Ian Fleming (1908-1964), who wrote the books on which the films were initially based, was a fairly unsavory character. The son of a Conservative Member of Parliament who died during World War I, Fleming worked for British naval intelligence in the Second World War and used some of this experience for his Bond novels. The first one, Casino Royale, appeared in 1953.As numerous commentators have pointed out, James Bond’s rise as a fantasy secret agent coincided with Britain’s actual decline as a world power during the postwar era. In Fleming’s fiction, however, the cool and collected Briton outthought, outfought and outloved not only his Soviet opponents, but also his American “allies.” The Bond novels were vaguely risqué in their time (Fleming’s wife called them “Ian’s pornography”), with hints of unusual sexual activity. Many adolescent boys were drawn to them in the less permissive atmosphere of the early 1960s. A number of the female characters are lesbians and have to be returned to “normalcy” by Bond. The relationships are generally of the dominator-dominated variety. In The Spy Who Loved Me, Fleming’s narrator, a woman, explains: “All women love semi-rape. They love to be taken. It was his sweet brutality against my bruised body that made his act of love so piercingly wonderful. That and the coinciding of nerves so completely relaxed after the removal of tension and danger, the warmth of gratitude, and a woman’s natural feeling.” Ayn Rand was a big admirer, unsurprisingly. Umberto Eco, in a 1979 work, pointed to a number of binary oppositions that defined the Bond novels: positive values and features (Free World, Great Britain, Western civilization, sacrifice, duty, willingness to undergo pain, loyalty, physical attractiveness) associated with the secret agent and negative ones (Soviet Union, foreignness, physical deformity, luxury, excess, perversion, disloyalty) attached to the enemy. Eco commented: “Bond represents beauty and virility as opposed to the Villain, who often appears monstrous and sexually impotent.” Racism and national chauvinism abound in Fleming, along with other unpleasant attitudes. There have been 21 “official” Bond films directed by nine different, mostly British and mostly unremarkable filmmakers; another was born in Canada, but raised in England (Roger Spottiswoode); and two more come from New Zealand (Lee Tamahori, who has a Maori father and British mother, and Martin Campbell, the director of the current film). In his The American Cinema, Andrew Sarris noted that Terence Young (Dr. No, From Russia With Love, Thunderball) had done “the best of the Bonds,” but that his overall career was “staggeringly undistinguished.” The individual, John Glen, who directed the most Bond films (five), oddly enough, hardly made anything else. It would be a mistake to become overly nostalgic about the early films. Even at the time, they were compared unfavorably to other efforts in the spy genre. Sarris, for example, in 1965, contrasted Sean Connery, the first Bond, to Michael Caine in Sidney Furie’s The Ipcress File. He wrote that Caine was “a more attractive performer” than Connery and suggested that Caine’s character was “more comically accessible to audiences than Connery’s. Caine’s success with women is more plausible than that of his predecessor largely because Caine’s banter sounds more knowing. Connery’s conquests seem to reflect the triumph of wardrobe over wit, and his women almost invariably succumb with the spontaneity of mechanical dolls in some future interplanetary convention of department-store buyers.”In Dr. No, Joseph Wiseman as the villain and Ursula Andress, as the love interest, stand out; in Goldfinger, one remembers the German actor Gert Fröbe and Honor Blackman. Connery had some suave and sophisticated moments. A great deal of the rest is silence. In recent decades, the series has more or less turned into a parody of itself, sometimes deliberately, as the special effects and weaponry have pushed everything else into the background. Fleming’s Casino Royale is an implausible Cold War tale. In the novel, Le Chiffre is a French Communist and agent for the Soviet assassination bureau SMERSH, who is presiding over a baccarat game in Monte Carlo in an effort to raise the 50 million francs in KGB funds he lost running a string of brothels! Bond, the best card player in the British secret service, is assigned to play Le Chiffre and beat him, thus provoking his employers to murder him. Bond is assisted by Vesper Lynd, with whom he falls madly in love, as well as an American CIA agent. Betrayals and double-crosses lie in store for 007.In the new film, the first version of Fleming’s Casino Royale (the 1967 film, with David Niven and a host of others, was a spoof), Bond (Daniel Craig) has only recently gained his “license to kill,” by murdering his second victim (whose violent death in a public bathroom we witness during the pre-credits). Then, inexplicably, Bond is on the trail of a bombmaker in Madagascar. An extended chase ensues, followed by an explosion. Contrary to instructions, Bond heads for the Bahamas and eventually Miami, where he foils a plot to blow up a new jetliner. Meanwhile, Le Chiffre (Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen), who, naturally, is a banker for “terrorists” in Campbell’s film, has invested $100 million for an African terrorist on the assumption that the jetliner will be blown up and its manufacturer ruined. Now his angry clients want their money back, and he plans to win it back playing baccarat at a casino in Montenegro. Bond is supplied with $10 million of the British government’s money, and an assistant, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), in an effort to foil him.If Bond films indicate something about the mood of those who commission, organize and shoot them (and perhaps wider circles than that), what does Casino Royale tell us? At the time of Daniel Craig’s hiring as Bond (following Connery, Roger Moore, George Lazenby, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan), director Campbell promised something “definitely darker, more character, less gadgets.” There are fewer weapons and explosions in Campbell’s work (although the lengthy chase scenes are tedious), and the mood is definitely more somber. The film is oddly spasmodic, fragmented and without any real center, geographical or moral. The headquarters of Bond’s agency, which played a considerable and reassuring role in many of the early films, is gone, replaced by an anonymous apartment (belonging to M [Judi Dench], Bond’s boss) in London’s Canary Wharf district. The villains are not “terrorists” in any meaningful political sense—in fact, it’s entirely unclear who and what they are. The leading participants in the events of the film’s last few minutes are virtually unknown to us, and die or disappear before they make their presence felt dramatically. The tone and rhythm of Casino Royale are deeply inconsistent. Not certain in which direction to proceed, the filmmakers, one senses, try various approaches. Scenes of genuinely sadistic, “realistic” violence alternate with idyllic sequences set in the Bahamas, Italy’s Lake Como, Venice and various locales in the Czech Republic (which for some reason stands in for Montenegro) and efforts at creating “character.” The relationship between Bond and Vesper is accorded a few minutes. While we are told they are mad for each other, little of the emotional or physical chemistry that would convince us makes its way to the screen. And Green and Craig are burdened, more or less out of the blue, with lines like this: “If the only thing left of you was your smile and your little finger, you’d still be more of a man than anyone I’ve ever met” and “I have no armour left. You’ve stripped it from me. Whatever is left of me—whatever I am—I’m yours.” Aside from a few moments reclining with Vesper, Bond here is oddly machine-like, almost robotic. He moves rapidly, hurling himself from one point to the next. Connery’s Bond had some of the swaggering, almost lazy self-assurance of the Cold War “democracies”; Crag is nervous, unhappy, isolated. Some of this feels appropriate to the historical moment, but the psychological changes in the character have not been worked through; they seem to have evolved more or less arbitrarily and accidentally. The sadistic violence is troubling. Here too the filmmakers, albeit unconsciously, are attuned to the “dark” and frustrated moods of certain social layers. The film opens with Bond beating a man half to death and nearly concludes with his own brutal torture. The early Bond films, including their fight scenes, were utterly unreal and artificial, quasi-comical. In essence, very little of that unreality has been addressed in the new Casino Royale (the politics are far more skewed and fanciful, in fact), except in the increased intensity and duration of the violence. Whereas events, including the love story, generally proceed rather quickly, the filmmakers slow down to devote a considerable amount of time, lovingly, to the torture scene in particular, during which Bond is strapped naked to a chair. There is nothing healthy in that. It is especially ironic that the “terrorists,” or at least their agent, should be carrying out acts of sexual torture. As we know, the American and British military and intelligence forces, and their allies, are the leading experts in this field. In the end, this is what makes a “realistic” Bond an oxymoron. Insofar as a Bond film comes into contact with social and historical facts, it must turn them on their head, losing any of its charm in the process. Aside from a few entertaining and adventurous moments, and the lovely settings, there is very little to Casino Royale. And "
194,JLU_Doc4_JamesBondCasinoRoyale,JLU,Action,Negative,"James Bond, Casino Royale","The introduction of a new James Bond always brings skepticism, and one of the major problems of Bond's 21st official cinematic adventure is that the skepticism remains when the final credits roll. Some will pick on the easy target: Daniel Craig, the new physical incarnation of Bond. Craig, a blond-haired, blue-eyed Brit, is not the type we typically associate with 007, and backlash against his casting sprang immediately upon his connection to the role. Honestly, it's petty, since it's what he does with role that's important, not how he looks. Craig is actually a great choice for the new Bond persona of Casino Royale; it's the new spin on the character from screenwriters Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis that leaves doubts. Their Bond is more low-rent thug than suave cosmopolitan—more government assassin than super spy. He is, essentially, without personality, and it is to Craig's credit that he tries his best to instill some charm into a charmless role. Since the movie is an obvious attempt to restart the franchise from the beginning (actually using Ian Fleming's first Bond novel as its inspiration) and the character is just starting to develop, the decision makes sense, but the movie suffers because of it nonetheless. The movie opens with Bond acquiring his ""00"" status by killing two men. Somewhere in Africa, a man with one useful eye named Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) takes some money from so-called freedom fighters. Bond, meanwhile, is in Madagascar, tracking down terrorist Mollaka (Sebastien Foucan) to retrieve information from him. After an extended chase that leads him to kill Mollaka and blow up part of a foreign embassy, Bond is obviously not on MI6 leader M's (Judi Dench) best side. Bond decides to decipher information retrieved from the terrorist on his own and makes his way to the Bahamas as a rogue agent. There Bond finds Alex Dimitrios (Simon Abkarian), who helps with the execution of terrorist activities, and his wife Solange (Caterina Murino).. After some wooing of Solange, Bond discovers Dimitrios' plans involving the destruction of a new jet airliner in Miami. That plan, of course, is thwarted by 007, and Bond is back slightly on M's good side, leading her to let him join a high-stakes, no-limit hold-'em poker game run by Le Chiffre at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. The catch: Bond must answer to the Treasury Department's liaison Vesper Lynd (Eva Green).Clearly, a lot is happening in the plot, and as per usual, most of it makes little to no sense. Occasionally, the script's weaving and winding, double-cross-filled plot is frustrating and sloppy, especially when Bond seems to have an extrasensory knowledge of who the real villains are before any evidence arises. A good chunk of the story revolves around the poker game, and director Martin Campbell never achieves any worthwhile tension in these scenes. There's one of the movie's four action sequences, a chase in a stairwell, randomly thrown in the middle of the poker plot to spice things up, but it feels forced. The other action sequences fare much better. Instead of the gadget-heavy, exaggerated action to which we've become accustomed, the sequences here are based slightly more in reality. The lengthy chase in Madagascar succeeds the most, with Bond and Mollaka running and climbing up the steel of a construction site. Another has Bond hanging on for dear life to a truck rigged to explode as a terrorist attempts to knock him off. The climax is a shoot-out in a building collapsing into the canals of Venice, which provides an added dynamic to what could be pretty standard stuff.Other than the story's weak points, there's also the problem that, while Le Chiffre has a creepy gimmick in the form of tear ducts that bleed, Bond's arch-nemesis finds himself at the mercy of other, lesser characters more than once. He's a generic villain and, at best, a mild threat to our hero. One distressing scene has Le Chiffre torturing Bond (it involves a nude Bond, strapped to a chair with no bottom, and a length of rope), and while it gives the villain a bit more menace, the scene is more intriguing for the fact that Bond shows inklings of masochism. The notion is one of the better character moments for a Bond who hardly talks, especially early in the movie, and it gives Craig one of many chances to allude to Bond's darker side. This brooding Bond is sometimes refreshing, but there might be too much of it here. It's a wise move to show Bond in love here to balance his character, and Eva Green is positively stunning in the role. Throughout the course of the movie, there are hints of the charismatic character we've become used to, but by the end, Bond seems to be on his way to a permanent stay in the shadows of his pain.Where this new vision of the series is heading could have promise, and it's good this is not a prequel. A character like Bond should already be pretty well-defined after 20 movies, and an origin story is almost a trivial exercise, really. It doesn't have to be, of course, but that's what Casino Royale ultimately feels like."
195,JLU_Doc5_JamesBondCasinoRoyale,JLU,Action,Negative,"James Bond, Casino Royale","Although box office has remained strong worldwide, even some of the most ardent fans of the James Bond series felt the series reached a creative low with the last two films starring Pierce Brosnan as 007, 1999's The World Is Not Enough and 2002's Die Another Day.  For me, though, the slump goes back to 1997's Tomorrow Never Dies, but that one seemed to go over better with Bond aficionados. The last film I liked in the series was the first of the Brosnan Bonds, 1995's Goldeneye, which happens to be the last film original Bond producer Albert R. ""Cubby"" Broccoli had any input on (although uncredited) in any shape or form.  But after Cubby died in 1996, the quality of the series headed south quickly despite remaining highly profitable.  Cubby was clearly the major creative force behind the Bond franchise who made it work.All the subsequent Bond films after Cubby's death have been produced by his stepson, Michael G. Wilson, and his daughter, Barbara Broccoli, who both collaborated on several of the films with their father dating back to the late 1970s and early 1980s.  But with Cubby gone, the magic is gone as well.Casino Royale was Ian Fleming's first 007 novel published in England back in 1953 and it was previously made into a god-awful 1967 all-star comedy spoof that went through five directors and 10 (not all credited) screenwriters, but also featured a great musical score by Burt Bacharach.  There is even an earlier TV version from 1954 (when the book was published in the U.S.) where actor Barry Nelson (the man who hands the keys to the Overlook Hotel to Jack Nicholson in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining) plays “Jimmy Bond” and Peter Lorre plays the villain. Not counting the '67 comedy version of Casino Royale and 1983's Never Say Never Again, the new serious interpretation of Casino Royale is the 21st ""official"" James Bond film produced by EON Productions, the company Cubby co-founded with his production partner, Harry Saltzman, who left the series in 1975.After the lackluster previous three Bond entries starring Brosnan, I had high hopes for the new Casino Royale because it was being billed as a ""grittier"" Bond film, and the last two times Bond ""returned to basics,"" it resulted in what are possibly my two favorites of the entire series, 1989's Licence to Kill and 1981's For Your Eyes Only.  Furthermore, Casino Royale had Martin Campbell returning to direct, and in my estimation, his first Bond film, Goldeneye, was the last enjoyable entry in the series. Campbell's Casino Royale is indeed grittier, but unfortunately, it's only marginally better than the last three.  Unlike Licence to Kill and For Your Eyes Only, I think filmmakers got a little too down to earth for their own good this time, and, in turn, squeezed out a lot what's fun about these movies. Licence to Kill and For Your Eyes Only had just the right balance of grit, wit and spectacular action.  The latest Bond, however, is overlong (its 144 minutes makes it the longest Bond to date), often sluggish and lacking in the kind of big, exciting action we've come to expect in Bond movies.But on the plus side, Casino Royale contains no digital effects, which is refreshing after the previous two Bonds became overwhelmed with digital effects.For those who thought Timothy Dalton's demeanor was too serious as Bond (I thought Dalton was just right for the role), Dalton is practically Roger Moore as compared to the latest Bond, blond-haired, blue-eyed Daniel Craig (Layer Cake, Infamous), who plays the role with a stone-faced intensity more reminiscent of Charles Bronson.  Craig, though, isn't the problem.  The problem is that he's the centerpiece of an inconsistently paced film that goes on way too long and doesn't have enough action or suspense. Furthermore, the latest Bond theme song, ""You Know My Name"" by Chris Cornell, may very well be the most instantly forgettable in series history. Since this is based on Fleming's first Bond novel, Casino Royale, like Batman Begins, is a return to the origins of the character in an attempt to revitalize a creaky franchise.  In the film, Craig's Bond has just recently been made a double 00 agent by his superior M (Judi Dench) and 007’s first assignment is to neutralize a money launderer for terrorists named Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen).  Bond's mission takes him from Uganda to the Bahamas to Miami to the Balkan States to Venice as he tracks the one-eyed, asthmatic, and, of course, sadistic Le Chiffre. After joining forces with a fellow British agent (and eventual love interest) named Vesper Lynd (Eva Green of Bernardo Bertolucci's The Dreamers), Bond and Le Chiffre finally come face to face during an international poker game where the British government stakes Bond in an attempt to bankrupt Le Chiffre by having Bond beat him at the gambling table.  This is also where Bond first meets his future long term CIA friend and contact Felix Leiter (played here by Jeffrey Wright) and gets introduced to what will become his signature drink, a martini, shaken not stirred. It not until the very end that we first hear 007 utter his famous, ""Bond, James Bond"" line, and not until the end credits that we hear Bond's famous theme music. Casino Royale has a couple of decent chase sequences, and Craig does have a strong screen presence, but just like the Cornell's theme song, most of what happens is instantly forgettable and nothing we haven't seen before. From the results of EON’s last four Bond films, this is clearly a worn-out franchise ready to be put out to pasture.  The man with the license to kill has become the man with the license to bore."
196,JLU_Doc6_JamesBondCasinoRoyale,JLU,Action,Positive,"James Bond, Casino Royale","People smarter than me and infinitely more invested in the role of women in the Bond franchise may debate Vesper’s place as the “best Bond girl,” and who am I to argue, really? My pre-Craig Bond knowledge is nonexistent outside of one Brosnan outing (and that one I only watched for Toby Stephens’s homoerotic lip curl). I don’t anticipate filling in the blanks because, frankly, 50 years of Bond has always sounded exhausting and I have a 2 1/2-year-old now, so the likelihood of catching up at this point is basically none. But I can tell you this: I never would have cared about James Bond had it not been for Vesper’s electrifying presence in Casino Royale. Vesper was the one who pulled me into Bond the franchise, not Bond the man. The ghost of Vesper Lynd haunts man and franchise both, just as she haunts me. As Adele once wailed about a relationship with a tragically premature ending: We could have had it all. Looking back, it’s so clear that the first act of Casino Royale treads water until Vesper arrives. So much time is dedicated to establishing the character of Craig’s Bond to distinguish him from previous iterations. Too much time, arguably, when all we need to know are three simple facts. Bond has been newly promoted to 00 status within MI6, he plays by his own rules, and he is ruled by his own emotions more than he would like to admit. Dispassion comes easily to him in his line of work but only up to a certain point. Killing people is nothing. The human cost is something else. When faced with the latter, simmering rage taints his actions with impulsivity yet also amplifies his efficacy as an assassin. Passion makes Bond deadlier, which begs the question: When M (Judi Dench) cautions him not to let his emotions cloud his judgment after his actions cause the death of an innocent woman he recently seduced for information, does she really mean it? Or is she manipulating Bond in ways that will come back to haunt her later in Skyfall, urging him to shut down because she knows it’s his emotions and not the lack of them that makes his judgment too clear? It seems almost too convenient that Vesper’s introduction comes in the scene directly after M’s warning. From the moment Vesper sits across from Bond, you know – he knows – we know that this woman is different. Green’s smoky voice and smokier eyes are the least of her appeal, though paired with a visage so sharply cut from marble that it is rivaled only by that of co-star Mads Mikkelsen, they’re not nothing, either. Rather, the qualities that draw us in are her quick wit and the murky depths her wit conceals. Vesper barely has to look at Bond before she sizes him up with devastating accuracy — metaphorically and literally, as he discovers later. Vesper allows Bond to teach her about poker on the train, letting Bond believe that she, a grown woman and an accountant with Her Majesty’s Royal Treasury, has never heard of one of the most common forms of gambling in the world. (It is worth noting that both Bond and the writers of Casino Royale cutely believe that Vesper could be so unworldly; Green wisely never plays her that way.) Vesper says, with perfect sincerity, “I like this bluffing thing.” And Bond has no idea, no idea, that from the moment they locked eyes, she has been doing exactly what he just described to her. Not playing the cards, but playing the man across the table. Bluffing within an inch of her life. Of all the spies in this movie, she’s the best of them. Bond never stood a chance. Is it Bond’s ego that sets the trap, or is Vesper just that good at fooling him? Two things can be true. These two people in particular are a perfect match for each other, even if the match ultimately isn’t made to last. Bond’s ego blinds him to Vesper’s secrets, if only because he mistakenly assumes her secrets have no relevance to the mission to reposition the villainous banker Le Chiffre (Mikkelsen) as a British ally. Meanwhile, Vesper’s unwillingness to simply go along with whatever Bond says acts not only as a hook for his growing interest in her but also as a smokescreen for her true motives. If Bond were a worse spy, he’d be too distracted by trying to solve the mystery that is Vesper Lynd to accomplish his mission. Instead, he casually notes everyone has a tell (an involuntary reaction that reveals a poker player is bluffing) except for her, and he moves on. Bond’s personal intrigue into Vesper’s character never overshadows the international intrigue, which is only natural. He’s very good at his job, after all. But not great. He’s new, remember? This Bond isn’t quite great yet. Great spies are heartless. The constant danger, the killing in the name of Queen and Country, the lack of meaningful connection to other human beings is supposed to keep spies heartless because that is the only way they remain assets to the establishments who need invisible men and women (dare we call them specters?) to do their dirty work for them. But in the midst of the danger and the killing, connection slips in through the cracks and revives what’s left of Bond’s heart. It is Bond’s job to participate in the danger and Vesper’s to observe; those lines are not meant to be crossed. Bad timing and an obvious earpiece put Vesper in the middle of violence with Bond, and although Bond is the one who kills two of Le Chiffre’s dissatisfied terrorist customers to protect both himself and Vesper, her participation in the murders unmoors her. Necessity requires Bond to return to the poker game as if nothing happened, but for all her ability to hide herself from Bond, she can’t shake the new reality of her perilous game. Bond finds her in the shower, presumably hours later, still in jewels, purple gown soaked, curled in on herself, shivering, staring at something only she can see. He says nothing. He joins her. He puts his arm around her. He switches the water from cold to warm, and he holds her simply because she needs to be held. Bond is at his best here in the shower scene of Casino Royale. Not when he’s chasing airplanes or staring down a man who weeps blood, but here, when Vesper brings out a side of him that either never existed before, or was supposed to be long dead and buried. In giving him a reason to remember that he is a man and not just a killing machine, Vesper changed Bond forever. When he fell in love with her, he gained a heart and gave it away in the same instant. He perhaps doesn’t realize this until Le Chiffre’s desperation after losing the poker game prompts him to stage a kidnapping of Vesper (the staged part is, of course, unknown to Bond) in order to abduct and torture the secret agent who orchestrated his downfall. Bond’s own feelings for Vesper only become known to him when the unthinkable happens and he gets so close to breaking, not from Le Chiffre’s extremely ballsy method of torture (I’m so sorry) but from the sound of Vesper’s screams in another room. Those screams save Bond, in a way. The emotions they awaken in him bring clarity he previously lacked. By the time Le Chiffre is dead and they’ve been rescued, Bond already suspected Vesper was a woman he can never truly know. As he recuperates, though, he accepts this fact about her and accepts that he loves her anyway. What could be less like a spy, whose very existence depends on discovering every last one of any given person’s secrets? It’s a failure on a molecular level of who he is supposed to be, but that failure sets him free from the isolated life his cold past and colder surrogate mother figure (both to be explored later in Skyfall) have groomed him to believe is the only life for which he is suited. Bond exchanges that life for something even riskier than secret missions and extrajudicial assassinations: a simple life. A future with the woman he can never understand, the woman he loves. The guilt weighs heavily on Vesper, the reason for her tears at Bond’s revelation of her name being the password for the transfer of his poker winnings knowable only after the rest of the movie unfolds. But she never wavers. Despite a fate she can’t escape, she steals as much time as she possibly can with the man she loves. She steals it with all the life she has left, making the most of every moment with Bond before her past catches up with the both of them. It was never Vesper’s intention to fall in love with Bond. To conceal her true objectives from him was vital, of course, but never in the methods of the stereotypical female double agent (think Elsa from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade). She did not actively seduce Bond — if anything, she actively tried not to, both to protect herself and keep her inevitable betrayal as clean as possible. Just as Bond could not have predicted Vesper cracking his icy shell, she could not have predicted finding in him a man better than the one who embroiled her in all this chaos and gave her a necklace she can’t bring herself to remove until her final day of life. “It was time,” she says. But it was always too late. In the tradition of one-and-done dames, Casino Royale had to end with Vesper’s corpse. A foregone conclusion, as clumsy as it is regressive. Vesper’s betrayal and death were weapons of screenwriting designed to leave Craig’s Bond a more broken man at the end than he was at the beginning, an aggravatingly familiar trope set in stone before the shepherds of this more modern and serious Bond reboot knew what they had both in Green and in the character of Vesper Lynd herself. By the time they did know, it was too late to take it back. As a sequel to Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace was doomed from the start. In the midst of all its production woes, it had the impossible task of reckoning with Vesper’s actions. For expediency’s sake, it tackles the issue merely as a plot device rather than a real exploration of Vesper’s character and motivations. The result is unsatisfying for both the audience and for Bond, embittering him unnecessarily and freezing his character development in place. Quantum of Solace does not, in fact, provide solace. For anyone. The unfinished business and wasted potential of Vesper hangs over the rest of the Craig era, a ghost too vibrant and consumed with unfinished business to fade away quietly into the night. With the benefit of hindsight, one can imagine a different trajectory for Craig’s Bond movies if only Vesper had not sacrificed herself for such lofty pointlessness. If she, alive and whole in a more compelling sequel to Casino Royale, had been able to tell Bond herself why she betrayed him. At the end of that movie, she could have been Bond’s ally again after redeeming herself for her duplicitous role in the Le Chiffre affair. Or, in the opposite direction, she could also have become Bond’s nemesis, his very own Irene Adler — the woman he can never conquer, never predict and never love any less for it. Skyfall is very nearly an untouchable masterpiece, but imagine a version of it where Vesper guides Silva’s hand to hit Bond where he’ll hurt the most. Imagine Spectre with Vesper at the center of the conspiracy instead of a botched Blofeld. Imagine a No Time To Die where Bond sacrifices himself to save a daughter with his eyes and Vesper’s smile. Whether Bond’s beloved or Bond’s ultimate foe, either option is better than dead. But Vesper Lynd is dead. Three out of the four movies that follow her death are totally crippled by it; Skyfall survives simply because it’s the one film not directly or indirectly about her or the repercussions of her death on Bond’s psyche. Bond the man and Bond the franchise simply never recovered from allowing Vesper Lynd to die. What else is there to say? At least now, after all this time, she and James are finally together again. RIP to the best there ever was."
197,JLU_Doc7_JamesBondCasinoRoyale,JLU,Action,Positive,"James Bond, Casino Royale","Daniel Craig enters the picture as Casino Royale comes along at a much-needed time in 2006 to reboot James Bond for the 21st century. The road leading up to Casino Royale is a blockbuster documentary in and of itself. However, this is another story for another day. In the decade leading up to the film, the Bond franchise was geared more towards fantasy than being grounded in reality. What else could you do after Die Another Day? Listen, I like Pierce Brosnan and his contract was over. Moreover, his final film did to the franchise what Batman and Robin did for the Dark Knight. You can make the argument that they were at rock bottom and needed to do something. With the rights to Casino Royale back under the fold, it was time to just bring things back to the beginning and give the James Bond franchise a fresh start. This was a risk for the studio and producers but it was the right time for the franchise. In doing so, they honor everyone that came beforehand and finally brought justice to Ian Fleming’s book in a way that the 1967 spoof never could. The casting for this film is absolutely perfect. Sure, there was some initial scrutiny when it came to casting Daniel Craig. His rugged look and blonde hair didn’t mesh with the five actors who preceded him in the role. Craig’s performance harkens back to Timothy Dalton’s work on-screen. He plays more to the seriousness of the role than the humor that we saw from the likes of Roger Moore. What he has to do more than the others is take it back to the start of Bond’s career. There are always high expectations that come with Bond–maybe more so than with any other franchise because of the history. Craig absolutely delivered in his performance–one of the best of 2006 and Oscar-worthy if you ask me. Fifteen years later, we’re a day away from the world premiere of Craig’s final performance as Bond in No Time to Die. As Vesper Lynd, Eva Green feels so much different than previous Bond women. Her character doesn’t feel like she’s there for show. She’s not the type that Bond will just screw around with in other to get information. In the end, of course, she turns out to betray James but she has her own reasoning. It’s something that we learn more about during the WGA strike-affected Quantum of Solace. But still, I like how start driving away from the tropes that made the Bond films what they are. Mads Mikkelsen does justice to the villainous role as Le Chiffre makes his on-screen debut in the Eon productions. When he’s torturing Bond following the card game, he’s not torturing a stunt double. He’s torturing Craig himself. You can read a lot more about this scene in Nobody Does It Better. But anyway, Mads joins Benicio Del Toro in being the only people to date to appear in the James Bond, Star Wars, and Marvel franchises. A number of actors have appeared in two of the three franchises so we’ll see if this number increases over time. Musically speaking, David Arnold’s fourth Bond score works for the film. Being a veteran of the franchise, he knows what works best for the film and what doesn’t. It’s an interesting choice to hold off on the classic Bond theme until the end of the film. In its place throughout the film, however, is a recurring motif from the title song, “You Know My Name,” sung by Chris Cornell. But hey, this also speaks to where Bond is in his career. He’s not the veteran 007 that we know from the previous movies because he’s at the start of his career. Look at how M (Judi Dench) treats Bond when he breaks into her place! I wouldn’t change a thing about Casino Royale. It is as perfect as a James Bond film can get for a script based in reality rather than fantasy. Martin Campbell is a Bond veteran as he helped retool the franchise with Pierce Brosnan in GoldenEye. Gone are the gadgets but some of the other classic Bond tropes return. Instead of depending on CGI, they largely focus on practical effects especially during the major set pieces at the Madagascar building site, the Miami International Airport, and the Venetian house sinking. While Bond is in the Bahamas, he wins Alex Dimitrios’s (Simon Abkarian) 1964 Aston-Martin DB5, a callback to Goldfinger. Dimitrios’s wife, Solange (Caterina Murino), is soon discovered dead. Casino Royale takes things back to the start for James Bond with a new actor and delivers one of the best films in the franchise."
198,JLU_Doc8_JamesBondCasinoRoyale,JLU,Action,Positive,"James Bond, Casino Royale","While watching the Everything or Nothing documentary, Barbara Broccoli recalled an important conversation she had with her father, Cubby. He said, “Whenever you have a problem – go back to Fleming.  Go back to the books.” This was the basis for how Casino Royale came to be. Casino Royale was the necessary reboot of Bond and the only way Casino Royale could be fully realised on screen.  Die Another Day disappointed not only critics but also Bond fans alike.  But getting Casino Royale off the ground was not going to be easy, and it stems right back to when the book was first published in 1953. Ian Fleming always wanted Bond to be adapted for the movies.  Unfortunately the studios could only see Bond as a TV series.  Frustrated, Fleming sold the rights to Casino Royale cheaply which later prevented Broccoli and Saltzman from making it the first Bond feature film (Dr. No became the first instead).  What came out of this was a TV adaptation where James Bond was renamed as Jimmy Bond for the American audiences.  It’s interesting that Joe Don Baker’s character in Goldeneye (Jack Wade) calls Bond “Jimmy” or “Jimbo” – American slang for James, but it can also be viewed as an obvious reference to the past.  In 1967, a spoof version starring Woody Allen, David Niven and Peter Sellers followed where there were multiple Bonds in one film. In fact the rights to Casino Royale have been passed around (like tic tacs) so many times, that each attempted adaptation forgot the key ingredient – including the actual James Bond in his integral form!  It’s no wonder Fleming was horrified but worse was yet to come. After Kevin McClory won his court case over the rights of Thunderball, it gave him a certain privilege to start his own rival Bond film after a certain number of years.  This spawned Never Say Never Again in 1983 but he also tried to negotiate rights with Columbia Pictures for Casino Royale.  At the same time Sony was trying to negotiate the rights of Spider-Man off MGM/UA in exchange for Casino Royale.  Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson had to fight back and it was only due to McClory’s no show in court due a visa problem that the rights for Casino Royale was finally back in the hands of EON and the Broccoli family.  And thank God for that because Casino Royale is one of the best Bond films ever – period. The success of Casino Royale really stems from two things – a faithful adaptation of Fleming’s most famous novel (while updating it to the modern world) and rebooting Bond with Daniel Craig. I remember when Daniel Craig was announced as Bond and the amount of negative vitriol aimed at him.  It was totally uncalled for.  I just kept thinking “let’s see what he can do before we judge him” but even Sam Mendes, director of Skyfall admitted at the time that he thought it was a terrible idea (Everything or Nothing documentary, 2012).  But I can see why Barbara fought very hard for Daniel Craig.  While it must have been difficult to drop Pierce Brosnan (it wasn’t his fault why his last film was so sh*t) but the change was necessary.  If Craig’s performance in Layer Cake (which is a brilliant film btw) was any indication that he could be Bond, Craig possesses the characteristics that would take Bond into the new world and new era.  Barbara Broccoli believed this and Craig went on to prove his critics wrong with an absolutely tremendous performance.  I hope those idiots at danielcraigisnotbond.com are weeping right now… What makes Craig’s performance so good is for the first time (in a long time) we got to see an emotional side to Bond. The beginning of Casino Royale easily establishes what we already know (or should know) about Bond – he’s a cold killer spy.  The opening scenes shot beautifully in black and white shows Bond at his deadliest and brutal best.  We see Bond bleed, bruised and battered after fights.  We see him in peril and tortured.  He bulldozes his way from situation to situation (e.g. the awesome parkour chase) without care.  Only his ego and his drive motivate him to get the job done.  He’s a “blunt instrument” as M would say.  This is Bond going back to his roots. It is around halfway through the film with the introduction of Vesper Lynd where Bond really comes alive and we see a different side of him – something that has rarely been explored in the previous films.  The first scene shared between Bond and Vesper is the best dialogue I’ve heard in ANY Bond film.  It starts off as flirtatious banter as they “size each other up”.  It’s like watching a married couple!  When the poker game is in full swing and Bond faces the endless twists and turns, we see how others perceive his brutality as an agent for her majesty’s government.  Vesper becomes a firsthand witness to what kind of world Bond lives in.  Traumatised and in shock, she sits alone in the shower, letting the water wash off the memory (or maybe realising what she had let herself in for with her own motives).  Realising this, Bond comforts her.  This was the moment where Bond doesn’t think about missions or getting the job done.  This was the moment Bond fell in love with Vesper and vice versa.  Two characters broken by their past, vulnerably finding each other to be the emotional crutch they needed to survive. Vesper is a complicated woman and probably why she is my favourite Bond girl of all time.  Smart, sophisticated and beautiful, she certainly matches Bond in terms of his humour, charm and devotion.  While her own motives were kept hidden, falling in love with Bond was probably not part of her plans.  But she did. She watches Bond confess his love and give up the spy life just for her, something that must have taken her by surprise.  So to see her break his heart and betray him after all they had been through is heart-breaking.  Obviously she never intended for him to get hurt, sparing his life from ball breaker Le Chiffre’s torture.  No matter how much we will this relationship on, it feels that Vesper and Bond’s love affair was doomed from the start and that’s why it will always feel tragic.  Killing herself spares her the lifetime of guilt and pain but desperately separates her from the one man who got her, the one man who still fought for her, despite her deception. In all the Bond movies, this is the most emotional and personal Bond adventure I’ve seen and kudos to Daniel Craig and Eva Green for making this work. Casino Royale works because it highlights that James Bond is a tortured soul, just how Fleming intended.  Like On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, it robs Bond of a happy ending but reminds the audience that there are no happy endings in Bond’s world.  Unlike OHMSS where Teresa’s death robbed Bond of a new life (committed by outside forces), Bond was deceived by the one he loved.  It’s a death that is hard to take. Bond seemed to be growing up because he has always thought of women as “disposable pleasures”.  You genuinely feel sorry for him.  As much as Vesper was herself a pawn in the organisation’s game (later to be known as Quantum), it is the unseen enemies, the ones who we turn a blind eye to that sets us up for failure and pain.  Bond learnt the hard way and it sets up Quantum of Solace so perfectly.  Craig gives Bond a hidden emotional depth – every punch, every kill, every secret and lies hurts him.  It’s no wonder why he has quickly elevated as the best Bond ever. The poker scenes are filled with edge of your seat tension with Mathis constantly reminding the audience how much money is in the pot or what cards are needed to win the game.  Mads Mikkelsen is brilliant as Le Chiffre.  It’s nice to see a villain for a change under pressure throughout rather than a villain who is constantly in control and having the upper hand on everyone else.  The more Le Chiffre is under pressure to win the money back for his expensive (and pissed off) clients, the more extreme his lengths would go.  Composer David Arnold evokes the spirit of John Barry with his best film score for Bond. But most importantly for Casino Royale, it brings back respect to James Bond and the entire franchise.  It really saves it.  If people thought Die Another Day would be the death of Bond, Casino Royale was Bond reborn. While Fleming may have been horrified at the early attempts of Casino Royale, I hope somewhere up there, he is proud of this adaptation."
199,JLU_Doc9_JamesBondCasinoRoyale,JLU,Action,Positive,"James Bond, Casino Royale","15 years ago today (16th November, 2021), the 21st James Bond film, Casino Royale, was released in UK cinemas: it earned rave reviews, became the franchise's highest-grossing entry at that point and eliminated any negative pre-publicity that had surrounded Daniel Craig's casting with the same kind of ruthless efficiency that his newly-minted agent 007 was immediately seen to display on-screen. A decade-and-a-half later, the release of No Time to Die in late September drew to a close Craig's five-film era as Bond – a tenure which saw the film series rebuke the critics once again and reestablish itself as a major player in the world of modern blockbuster cinema. But when the time comes for producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson to take stock and consider where Bond should go next, they'd be wise to reflect on past successes and, specifically, to consider what it was about Casino Royale that worked so well. Now, this isn't a rallying cry to simply ""do Casino Royale again"" – in fact, the biggest mistake that Bond 26 could make would be to replicate the look and feel of the Daniel Craig movies, successful though they might've been. Instead, what the next 007 movie needs to mimic is the 2006 film's spirit of reinvention – in short, it needs to be as different from Casino Royale as Casino Royale was from Pierce Brosnan's final hurrah, 2002's extremely mixed bag Die Another Day. It's easy to forget 15 years on how daring Casino Royale felt at the time, especially since the Daniel Craig era has since made subverting expectations and daring to go to places the franchise previously never would its stock in trade, culminating – perhaps inevitably – in the actual, not-fooling-honest death of James Bond. Looking to reimagine the 44-year-old series like never before, Broccoli, Wilson, director Martin Campbell (who'd previously relaunched Bond to great success, though in less subversive style, with 1995's Goldeneye) and screenwriters Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Paul Haggis ditched much of what was familiar and what might at one time have been considered sacrosanct. Fronted by a steely but sympathetic Craig, who was ably supported by a sensational turn from Eva Green and the absolutely magnetic Mads Mikkelsen, the film loosely adapts Ian Fleming's story of Bond looking to financially cripple Le Chiffre – an enemy agent who is bankrolling terrorists – over a game of cards, only for the situation to spiral wildly out of control as 007 is hit by a betrayal he never saw coming. Casino Royale was like nothing the series had offered us before – yes, gone were the gadgets and quips, but Bond had been here before, adopting a similar back-to-basics approach in the late 1980s when the tongue-in-cheek theatrics of the Roger Moore films gave way to a more sober portrayal of 007's world in two films starring Timothy Dalton. More striking even than the shift in tone was the ease with which Casino Royale did away with the opening gun-barrel sequence (at least in its traditional form), the brilliant inventor Q, Moneypenny and her playful relationship with Bond... you suspect even M might have been ditched if they (and audiences) weren't so fond of Judi Dench – and it's credit to the quality of the final product that not only did it wow critics and long-time Bond fans regardless but that it felt unquestionably Bondian despite the lack of those ingredients once thought untouchable and absolutely essential to the franchise formula. This willingness to be bold and audacious is what the next film would do well to lift from Casino Royale. The 007 films have always thrived on reinvention – the Sean Connery films evolved from Cold War era spy thrillers to wild spy-fi blockbusters, Roger Moore took Bond intergalactic amidst the Star Wars fever of the 1970s, with Timothy Dalton then bringing the character quite literally back down to Earth, while Pierce Brosnan ran the gamut from more personal, human stories to utterly outlandish action capers (and that was just in Die Another Day) – but Daniel Craig's first outing is perhaps the purest example of Bond being willing to strip the character to his bare bones and then rebuild in a way that works for modern audiences – and, crucially, the actor playing Bond. The temptation given the enormous critical and box office success of the Craig movies might be to simply produce a Craig-type movie but with a different actor – but to do so would be to ignore the best thing about Casino Royale and what allowed it and Craig to succeed. Give whoever picks up the baton next their own kind of Bond movie, let it reflect their strengths as a performer as Casino did Craig's. Do that and we'd bet big on Bond's next 15 years being every bit as bright as the last."
200,JLU_Doc10_JamesBondCasinoRoyale,JLU,Action,Positive,"James Bond, Casino Royale","Daniel Craig is no Sean Connery, and in the case of Casino Royale, that's a good thing. Casino Royale is the 21st film featuring James Bond. The British secret agent with the code name of 007 made his first movie appearance in 1962's Dr. No, starring Connery, who came to embody the role. Other Bonds, including Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, and Pierce Brosnan, have their fans, but the actors all worked in the shadow of Connery, perhaps because they were trying to be true to the character he created. The only way that an addition to the Bond film pantheon could be anything other than a retread is to strip away most of the links to the past and start fresh. Director Martin Campbell, who also directed Goldeneye, Brosnan's inaugural turn as 007, and veteran Bond writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade bring to Casino Royale a feel for what Bond is all about. But they have three major allies in their campaign to breathe life into a film franchise showing its age. The first is a willingness to start at the beginning, with the book in which Ian Fleming introduced Bond more than half a century ago. The second is Craig, who has the most penetrating blue eyes this side of Paul Newman and whose face seems to have been formed by Silly Putty, so flexible are his features, shifting easily from craggy good looks to physical agony to surprise to ardor to anger to arrogance. Craig's Bond is no supremely self-confident, suave agent with an ice-cold heart, although by the movie's end, it's easy to see how he will become that way. The third is perhaps the most valuable asset of all. Joining the writing team is newcomer (to the Bond legacy) Paul Haggis, who had a hand in writing two movies you may have heard of: Crash, which he also directed, and Million Dollar Baby, both best-picture Oscar winners. Haggis brings an edginess and modern sensibility to the script, making this Bond more credible and less of a superhero. Similarities to other Bond movies include several beautiful women, lots of car chases, fiery explosions, and a high body count, all of which serve to camouflage a thin plot. Casino Royale opens with a brief black-and-white segment in Prague that shows how Bond earned his double-0 status, then segues to Madagascar, where Bond botches an assignment, much to the fury of his boss, M, who coldly tells him that she should never have promoted him so soon and orders him to take an extended vacation until the furor blows over. He heads to the Bahamas, a perfect vacation spot, except that he isn't on vacation; he's trying to atone for the botched job, and the trail leads him to Le Chiffre, preferred banker to the world's terrorists. When Bond manages to mess up one of Le Chiffre's ""investments,"" the money-man, strapped for cash, decides to set up a high-stakes poker game in Montenegro to recoup his losses. M, who is reassessing Bond's potential, assigns him to win the game and bankrupt Le Chiffre, then offer him asylum in exchange for what he knows. She authorizes the multimillion-dollar stake but sends along an accountant, Vesper Lynd, to keep an eye on the money as well as the agent. Lynd is not the normal ""Bond girl."" She's smart, confident, independent, and focused on her work. She's also beautiful, but that's due as much to her intelligence as her physical attributes. The initial meeting between Bond and Lynd, as they size each other up, and their continuing repartee is one of the pleasures of the film. Then there's the poker game. In the book, Bond played Chemin de Fer, but the writers updated everything else, so why not the game that viewers can find somewhere on cable TV at any time of the day or night? The scenes are interminable, and it's an opportune moment for a popcorn run. And even when the poker game is over, the movie isn't. Casino Royale lasts two hours and 24 minutes, and the false endings are so abundant that when Bond utters his last line, it's somewhat of a surprise. However, all throughout the film, the dialogue is sharp and the introduction to iconic Bond touches - among them the tailored tuxedo, the martini - are deftly handled, often with a great deal of humor. The supporting cast is equally important and from Judi Dench, who brings her icy imperiousness to M, to Eva Green as the always-interesting Vesper Lynd, to Giancarlo Giannini, suavely continental as Bond's contact in Montenegro, to Mads Mikkelsen, deeply disturbing as Le Chiffre, each is well suited to what he or she has to do. But this is a Bond movie, and everything comes back to him and the actor who plays him. The filmmakers took a big gamble on Daniel Craig and on a script that updates everything (except Dench; keeping her was a no-brainer). This time, the gamble paid off"
