110,MRW_Doc1_Batman,"Over the last several decades, we have seen a number of different iterations of Batman come and go, from the early days of the serials, to the late '60s with Adam West, to the later film adaptations with Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney, and Ben Affleck. And now, Warner Bros. has decided to reboot the series once again, this time with the intriguing choice of Robert Pattinson as the legendary Dark Knight. However, this version, from director/co-writer Matt Reeves, is not only a much darker approach, but it also goes back to the original source material, where the titular hero was a full-on detective. Turning the franchise on its head like this was certainly a fascinating gamble, but would it prove to be the right direction to take the beloved character? The film opens as the Mayor of Gotham City is murdered by a mysterious psychopath called The Riddler (Paul Dano). The crime is investigated by Batman (Robert Pattinson), aka billionaire Bruce Wayne (two years into his crime-fighting job), and Lieutenant James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) of the GCPD. A message is left at the crime scene for Batman, leading him deeper into The Riddler's game, ultimately entangling him with Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), a young woman attempting to track down her friend, Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), a major crime lord in Gotham, and Falcone's right-hand man, The Penguin (Colin Farrell), with various pieces of the past coming to light along the way. It was no secret that there had been a lot of trouble getting the character of Batman up and going again after Christopher Nolan completed his outstanding trilogy in 2012. Ben Affleck was a decent fit for the part, but he just happened to be plagued with some pretty awful writing when it came to ""Batman vs. Superman"" and ""Justice League."" In that regard, it made perfect sense to start again from the ground up, which brings us to Matt Reeves' new, even moodier & darker version. Starting off with the high points, the film is very well shot by recent Oscar-winning cinematographer Greig Fraser (""Dune""). As mentioned, it's a very dark film, but the composition throughout is very skillfully executed, making for a grand visual feast. And speaking of grand, Oscar winner Michael Giacchino provides a suitably epic score to accompany the grand scale of the film. Lastly, if one person had to be singled out of this entire cast, it would have to be John Turturro, who gives the standout performance of the film as crime boss Carmine Falcone, despite having a rather short amount of screen time. Unfortunately, now we need to delve into what doesn't work about the film, which is, sadly, quite a bit. However, its number one issue is simply that Matt Reeves and Peter Craig's screenplay is rather weak. It was definitely an intriguing idea to go back to Batman's roots as a great detective to explore an area that we don't get to see very much of, but their approach is ultimately very padded out, repetitive, unengaging, and rather dull. At nearly three hours, this is easily the longest solo Batman flick by quite a bit, so it was a particularly strange choice to have the film be this slow and uneventful, and all the while, drowning it in doom and gloom. It was also rather strange to see Pattinson just kind of grunt all of his dialogue throughout (as Bruce AND Batman), causing him to have hardly any impact as the iconic superhero. Pattinson has certainly proved his acting chops since escaping the awful ""Twilight"" films by turning in notable performances in films like ""The Lighthouse"" and ""Good Time,"" so it was a shame to see him practically shut down for such a big, important role. Again, he wasn't given much to work with thanks to the weak screenplay, but even Turturro and Farrell were able to leave a slight lasting impression with their parts. At the end of these three lengthy hours, there just ends up not being a whole lot that's exciting or compelling about it. With a better story, a detective-focused Batman film could be something incredible. Again, it's not the approach that's the problem here, but rather the misguided execution that turns the film into a dreary, over-long slog. With the sequel already having been announced, we can only hope that Reeves takes a lot more time crafting the narrative next time, while also reigning in the excessiveness. Only then might we finally get a Batman film that does justice to those early days of the infamous Caped Crusader. Matt Reeves' ""The Batman"" features skillful cinematography, an epic score, and a memorable turn or two from the cast, but it's all undone by a remarkably weak screenplay that ultimately turns the film into a repetitive, unengaging, and over-long slog. There was a lot of potential given its fascinating approach to the character, but the execution proves to be rather misguided, making for a surprisingly disappointing and forgettable outing for the Dark Knight.",MRW_Doc1_Batman,MRW,Sci-Fi,Negative,The Batman
111,MRW_Doc2_Batman,"I am not totally against redoing films or remakes as if the source material or characters are rich then different directors can bring different aspects to the table either tonally or visually. Steven Spielberg recently brought to younger fans the classic musical/film West Side Story. Sci-fi film fans were treated to reduxes or reimaginings of classic films with Denis Villeneuve s Dune and Blade Runner 2049 and George Miller s Mad Max: Fury Road. They were all good films and brought new stuff to the table. Now, we get another Batman film with another actor in the lead role. This time it is a team comprised of director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Let Me In), co-writers Matt Reeves (War for the Planet of the Apes, The Yards) and Peter Craig (The Town, Bad Boys for Life) and a cast made up of Robert Pattinson (Twilight, Tebet), Zoe Kravitz (X-Men: First Class, Divergent), Jeffrey Wright (The French Dispatch, No Time to Die), Colin Farrell (Phone Booth, Widows), John Turturro (Barton Fink, Quiz Show), Andy Serkis (Black Panther, War for the Planet of the Apes), Peter Sarsgaard (Garden State, Green Lantern), Barry Keoghan (The Green Knight, Eternals), and Paul Dano (There Will Be Blood, Little Miss Sunshine). Here we get another dark Batman. Probably the darkest yet. Every moment of the film looks and is dark. There are no moments of light squeaky through at all. Gotham here is seemingly always in a state of nighttime and rain. Matching that mood set, Robert Pattinson s Bruce Wayne/Batman is sullen and dour. A way it is different is that it is more a mystery/detective-style story than a superhero one. There are some fight scenes (though not as many as superhero fans might hope for or expect) and, of course, the Bat suit and Batmobile, but this is more Batman using his brain and powers of observation to try to uncover the villain behind the murders. Even the villain is more of the mystery type in that he is a serial killer. One who uses his brain rather than superpowers or gadgets to wreak havoc. An interesting twist.While the film has been mostly applauded, that for me was where the good stuff ended. First of all, it is interminable. 2 hours and 56 minutes!!!! I mean .that is not necessary. Films of late are regularly over 2 hours but 3?!? Come on! Who has that kind of time? Seems rather overindulgent to me. Especially when you watch longer scenes of Batman riding his motorcycle that could have easily been trimmed. It was especially painful in the last half hour when I could see that it could have been wrapped up sooner but it continued to drag on. Then there is the lead actor. He is not awful. Probably somewhere in the middle. Not as good as Christian Bale or Michael Keaton and better than Ben Affleck and George Clooney. Still, he is not good here. Though, in all honesty, there is not much asked of the lead in regards to true acting. Batman/Bruce Wayne does not speak much. With few lines of dialogue, there is not much to do in that regard, but still, inthe hands of a more suitable or skilled actor, I think there was something which could have been done here. Another aspect I found distracting was the score/music. The man responsible for the music in the film, Michael Giacchino, an Oscar winner, is normally good having written the scores for films like Up, Inside Out and Coco. This time the music he wrote is distracting.",MRW_Doc2_Batman,MRW,Sci-Fi,Negative,The Batman
112,MRW_Doc3_Batman,"Somewhere inside The Batman there s a taut, slow-burning, two-hour crime drama right out of the 1970s golden decade of film. Unfortunately, director Matt Reeves and co-writer Peter Craig gorged themselves on the Batman mythos and wound up creating a sluggish, over-stuffed draft of a mini-series awkwardly crammed into movie form. Falling in love with Gotham itself, they spend a lot of time presenting an interminable link-footage travelogue of characters driving to and fro, forgetting that Gotham on film has always been  70s- 80s post-bankruptcy New York City, the most over-exposed cityscape in film history. The last thing anyone needs is an extensive tour of such a standard-issue backdrop.During the film s production, its creators also appear to have lost interest in their genuinely compelling central storyline, leading them to drown it in an indigestible gooey topping of expendable sub-plots. It s as if they were thinking,  We need to wedge in an emotional context involving a loyal family retainer here but get it over in as little time as possible! Can we unnecessarily flag biographical connections between characters, please? Oh, don t forget to shoehorn in the irrelevant late cameo for a popular character! We need urban blight clich s on set, please! Can someone make up a new drug for no reason? Give Wayne a secretary but only give her 20 words. Where are the sad orphans and pitiful drug users I ordered?  The reasons for The Penguin to even be in this film are tenuous at best while most other side-plots never even rise to the level of red herrings.However, very early in the film s interminable running time was a scene that stunned me. Unfortunately, that scene was when Robert Pattinson s Batman (aka Bruce Wayne) spies on Zo  Kravitz s Selina Kyle (aka Catwoman) as she undresses. It s a well-worn clich  that has always been tone-deaf to the fact that in real life   even if it was Pattinson himself ogling a woman through binoculars   it would still be creepy, disturbing, and gross. Miraculously, there are still film executives who feel that it is unrealistic, nay impossible, not to include footage dwelling on a hot female body in a way that doesn t advance the plot, develop a relationship, or add any crucial subtext.Batman s presence occurs while looking for a woman, Annika Koslov (Hana Hrzic), who it turns out is hiding at Kyle s apartment. While failing the Bechdel Test by permitting only the most stunted communication between the two women, the film prioritizes cramming in an insinuation that Kyle is bisexual. The film rejects the potentially more powerful idea that mutually supportive friendships are vital to working-class women with precarious lives, in favor of ramping up the sexualization. Rather than lending significance to Kyle s sapphic side, the film rests on the clich  that lesbians can be  cured  by heterosexual exposure, with Kyle converted as soon as a sufficiently hyper-masculine archetype, the Batman, walks into her life. This depthless portrayal is an instance of the strategic use of bisexuality where openness to girl-on-girl encounters is used to appeal to male fantasy. Speaking to Playboy in 2004, 50 Cent succinctly captured this boneheaded double standard, saying:  I don t like gay people around me But women who like women, that s cool. This is followed by Batman and Catwoman s first up-close contact, which sets the tone of the relationship for the rest of the film. When a policeman comes to investigate a disturbance, Batman pulls Catwoman against a wall, places his hand over her mouth, and tells her to be quiet as if she s not bright enough to figure it out or strong enough to handle it herself. Telling her to shut up, be quiet, do as she s told is the most common way they interact throughout the film. This scene is also one of two occasions where Batman saves her from peril, despite it being the disturbance or delay caused by his actions that is the only reason she winds up in danger. It s symbolic that this is the point where, now that the more important man has entered Kyle s life, her supposed lover, Annika, is erased as a living, breathing presence.In this same moment, the director makes another seedy choice. He shows us Catwoman suddenly relaxing in Batman s grip and pressing herself against him. A masked man who, at the start of the film, has explained that he terrifies criminals and innocents alike, creeps up on Kyle, surprises her, fights her, grabs her But the most crucial cue to the audience is to let us know women can t help but feel sexy when terrifying men loom out of the dark and immobilize them involuntarily. The moment is sexual, without being sexy. It shows female sexual response clicking on like a light switch, the instant accessibility presented in pornography, completely independent of anything here that would provide   let alone being intended for   her pleasure.A further scene returns to the issue of the male gaze, holding out the hope that the director knew there was something to say about this But the film merely doubles down on creepiness. Batman persuades Kyle to wear special contact lenses that allow him to see what she sees so he can surveil a club. One take could be that it allows the callow and virginal knight, Batman, to gain insight into the experience of a woman in an environment trading on female flesh   there s always been a reason women, particularly white women, receive priority entry to clubs. The problem with that generous interpretation is that Batman exhibits not a single moment of empathy with Kyle s experience, he s merely another man acting as puppet-master over a woman s body to fulfill his desires. In one stark display of power, despite her discomfort and her pleading that it will attract attention she s not seeking, he dismisses her protests and orders her to turn her head and look directly at a particular man. There s no time pressure, it s a crowded room, there are plenty of ways he could safeguard her and still observe the man, but he wants it his way and he wants it now.The scene proceeds with Kyle ultimately rejecting Batman s commands to pursue her own agenda. This is a persistent no-no for women in films: Batman is our hero so he gets to decide when, where, and how to endanger the female lead. Her refusal to subordinate herself to the aggressive bossiness of this man she barely knows must be punished so she walks directly into a menacing and uncomfortable encounter with a  friendly  man of past acquaintance. To emphasize the message, later in the film when Kyle disobeys Batman again, she comes close to death at the hands of the very same man. It s a portrayal going all the way back to Tippi Hedren as Melanie Daniels in Alfred Hitchcock s The Birds: women s untamed emotionality leads them and others into danger requiring salvation in male form.Fleeing to the bathroom after the first encounter, Kyle looks into the mirror allowing Batman to observe her while he berates her. Reeves fails to acknowledge that what occurred was the everyday power imbalance between the rich and those employed to pander to them, a form of low-level harassment in which Kyle would be risking her job or maybe her life by refusing to consent. Batman   with no context   pointedly accuses her of having a commercial and/or sexual relationship with the individual he s watching. One interpretation could be that he s jealous, but that d still be a pretty grim response to the object of his desire. Another is that this is an immature Batman still learning to control his emotions, but that just creates a contrast between Kyle s emotional responses requiring her punishment, while Batman s excesses of emotion invite no consequence upon his head, it s just part of his journey.It was impossible not to think back on this moment when, after a fairly minimal amount of ongoing connection, Kyle s character inevitably kisses Batman because no woman can resist swooning into the arms of a man whose first show of passion toward her is calling her a whore. To make clear that his words were no out-of-character accident, upon learning that Annika is deceased he takes the time to let Kyle know he deems it Annika s fault for being employed in an industry where she associates with  bad men . This ignores that the  bad men  are the same men populating the corridors of power and respectable walks of life from the mayor, to the district attorney, to the chief of police. Where is Annika meant to go when  bad men  are everywhere? Even her death arises not from her actions, but from a man s loose lips.Pattinson s Batman, at this point of the film, has been taciturn, controlling, dismissive, and insulting toward Kyle   the kiss is not a logical outcome of anything that has occurred. This is one impact of the overburdened plot of The Batman, which forces everything to an artificial resolution: an entire affair wham-bammed from first meeting to lovelorn parting without Batman ever earning that affection. Just following the comic books would have created something more realistic. The story of  the Cat and the Bat  has been an endless series of unresolved moonlit flirtations and   most crucially   genuine warmth between star-crossed lovers. There was a lost opportunity to make this a gentler kindling of mutual feeling, amplifying Kravitz s Catwoman as the worldly-wise spirit coaxing the inexperienced Wayne out from behind his mask of shyness.Instead, we get Wayne/Batman ticking off red flags on the checklist of emotional abuse: he s physically controlling, blocks her input, uses anger to dominate her, ignores her wishes, has sharp mood swings, criticizes her for not meeting his expectations, acts entitled and superior, and never apologizes or even acknowledges his failings toward her. This isn t some bold anti-hero, the director still rewards his abhorrent behavior with Kyle s kiss in a way that denigrates her character by making her look mercenary as if she s emotionally manipulating this brute by rewarding him with affection and obedience in exchange for his physical might. The film also devalues Annika still further by giving Kyle not one but two motives, the new one pushing the feminine deeper into the background and prioritizing men as the drivers of fate. For the rest of its runtime, The Batman coasts along on the usual  damsel in distress  model of romance, safe in its delusion that a woman kicking ass in a choreographed fight-dance makes a film redemptively pro-female. In its later sequences, The Batman piles on its disrespect for Kyle by showing more than once that she is strong enough to beat beta-male low-level hoodlums, but when faced with a fight of true consequence, she needs saving by the alpha male lead. This doubles down on the idea that Batman s appeal to Kyle is founded on the provision of male physical protection and the fantasy that one proves oneself a suitable mate for a strong woman by demonstrating you can physically subdue and overpower her. The only other woman with significant dialogue (also the only woman not employed in a service role) is mayor-elect Bella Re l (Jayme Lawson), who gets just enough time to give a token speech before being shot and then saved not once, but twice, by James Gordon and then by Batman. The fate of women in this film is never in their own hands: they die or live because men permit them to. The Batman is ultimately another boys-own coming-of-age film in which the boy, Wayne, is helped on his quest to become a (Bat)man by a woman subservient to his quest and forgiving of, indeed loving, his thoroughly toxic behavior toward her. While not seeking to ascribe bad intentions to Reeves or Craig   nor underrating Kravitz s genuine screen presence   there s a possibility that two men who came of age amid the cultural norms of the  80s might need help conceiving of a more egalitarian positioning of relationships or how to realistically personify a female perspective. Perhaps it s Hollywood? There are certainly entire realms of the business world where men cannot conceive of meeting a woman outside of a transactional exchange, whether related to career, status, power, money, or sex. While the usual online rent-a-mob might wail about  woke Batman  or feminists ruining a masculine icon, it wouldn t degrade Batman if his 2022 incarnation had remained true to the canon by presenting a competent Catwoman whose independence and force of will were appreciated and respected by Batman. Instead, The Batman is an incel fantasy of entitlement, another film where a woman can only be good if she devotes herself to fixing a man.",MRW_Doc3_Batman,MRW,Sci-Fi,Negative,The Batman
113,MRW_Doc4_Batman,"It s cause for modest celebration that  The Batman  achieves, for much of its nearly three-hour running time, a baseline of artistry: it s eminently sit-through-able. There s a category of movie that used to be the Hollywood stock in trade, which a dear departed relative used to call  brain cleansers  one kicks back, the time passes with some rooting interest, some excitement, some curiosity about what s coming next. For its first two hours or so,  The Batman  largely fulfills the commitment to be engaging and clever; its deftly inventive director, Matt Reeves (who co-wrote the script with Peter Craig), conveys the impression of substance where it s hardly to be found. The movie is good with an asterisk an asterisk the size of the financial interests at stake in the franchise s intellectual property. As free as Reeves may have been to make the film according to his lights, he displays an element of custodial, even fiduciary, responsibility. It may well win him favor with the studio, with the ticket-buying public, and with critics who calibrate their enthusiasm to box-office success, but it gets in the way of the kinds of transformative interpretations of the characters that would make the difference between a baseline movie and an authentically free and original one. The Batman is a vigilante who works with the co peration of the police, who project a bat-sign into the sky, with a bright light, as a call to him and a warning to evildoers who anticipate him swooping in. Yet, as he lands on a subway platform and lays low a gang of young miscreants, made up Joker-style, who are assaulting an Asian man, the victim is also struck with fear and pleads with the Batman not to hurt him. The Batman describes his uneasy role as an avenger indeed, he says, as vengeance itself in a voice-over that holds out hope that the superhero will be endowed with at least an average level of subjectivity and mental activity. No such luck: that voice-over might as well be a part of the explanatory press notes for all the insight it offers into the protagonist s thoughts. Yet his haphazard thwarting of random street crime in the chaos of Gotham City gets sharply focussed on one criminal, the Riddler (Paul Dano), who, in the opening act of his crime spree, virtually summons him. The Riddler gruesomely murders the mayor of Gotham and tapes to the victim s body a greeting card for the Batman and other clues to his motives and to his next victim to the conspiracy that he has discovered and the perpetrators he s targeting. In taunting the Batman by dosing him with knowledge, the Riddler is also making him an unwilling but inextricable ally, both forcing him to join in the same fight and informing him of the underlying and overarching truth about Gotham, about the social order that the avenging masked man is dedicated to defending and preserving. The Riddler has learned that many of the city s officials, particularly ones involved in law enforcement, have been on the take from gangsters (I m avoiding spoilers here and throughout); decisions to prosecute are tainted by the self-dealing of politicians and police. The Batman is drawn even further into the tangled conspiracy when he accidentally encounters another masked avenger, Catwoman (Zo  Kravitz), who, as Selina Kyle, works in a night club run by a gangster named Oz, who is nicknamed the Penguin (Colin Farrell), and frequented by other criminals, such as a mobster named Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), and corrupt officials. When her roommate and lover, Annika Koslov whom the Riddler linked to the conspiracy vanishes, the Batman helps her to investigate, and she helps him to untangle the web of corruption that the Riddler has discerned and capture the Riddler himself. Meanwhile, the Batman is working closely with a police detective named Jim Gordon (Jeffrey Wright), who, in collaborating in the pursuit of the Riddler, is playing the dangerous game of unmasking corrupt colleagues and superiors. The reason for dwelling on these details is pleasure. The intricacy of the movie s intertwined plots has a plain and simple efficiency that undergirds the onscreen actions like an architectural framework, and Reeves adorns that framework with a vigorous variety of visual twists and dramatic tempi. The opening scene, in which the Riddler spies on the mayor before doing him in, involves a telescope that Reeves (working with the cinematographer Greig Fraser) mimics with a telephoto lens, while, on the soundtrack, the masked Riddler wheezes with a huffing eeriness out of David Lynch. The best gizmo in the Batman s bag of high-tech tricks is a pair of contact lenses that are also video cameras beaming their signal to the devices of his choice. The movie s design also offers a handful of piquant touches, from the infinitesimal points of Catwoman s mask-ears to the cable zip line that the Batman discharges for rapid rescues and escapes. (The Batmobile, however, is definitively outshone by the vintage black Corvette in which Bruce Wayne, out of disguise, shows up at a funeral.) There s a car chase that, if not especially original, at least conveys its obvious patterns in images of taut precision and culminates in the film s money shot, which brings it to a rooting conclusion with a strikingly clever and simple twist of visual logic. There s a fight scene in a dark room at night where the only light comes from bursts of gunfire; there s a jolt of superheroic vulnerability when the Batman makes a midair misstep in his flight suit. In a movie deprived of humor, one moment of it bursts out with a gleeful surprise, as the gargle-voiced Penguin cuts loose with a rant attacking the Batman s linguistic skills. That s as good as it gets, though; the laundry list of moments that pop hangs on the framework as if to conceal its essential emptiness. The crucial marker of the movie s faux earnestness is visual darkness the movie is set largely at night (explained in part by the Batman s own nocturnal habits), which furnishes the bland metaphor, or clich , for grim doings. The sleek foreground of elaborate yet functional design doesn t reverberate with symbolic power; it has no loose ends for the free play of imagination. Its coherence is impressive, overwhelming and deadening. The energy of directorial intention doesn t reach offscreen it implies nothing beyond the action. (It s the kind of enticing visual beauty, conveying above all the realm of power, that Kogonada questions in  After Yang. ) The emptiness below the movie s surfaces reflects the emptiness of the characters it depicts; they re reduced to a handful of traits and a backstory, defined solely by their function in the plot. Even though the title character bears two identities and lives a double life constructed of careful and elaborate ruses,  The Batman  makes shockingly little of Bruce Wayne. Robert Pattinson s performance provides the only hint of substance: in both personae, he maintains a stone face throughout. The utterly repressed expression that he lends them could suggest anything from self-discipline to existential anguish, though I see it as a superhuman effort not to burst out laughing at the simulation of seriousness, of any personality at all. The movie s solid dramatic architecture is essentially uninhabited  The Batman  is a cinematic house populated only by phantoms with no trace of a complex mental life. The indifference to characters as sentient beings rather than pawns in a plot emerges in a twist that s a long-standing marker of action-film superficiality: apocalyptic chaos. Again avoiding spoilers, the Riddler doesn t only target individual high-level miscreants in Gotham but decides that the entire city deserves to go down with them. (The possibilities, with its Biblical implications, are endless and remain untapped.) When his monstrous scheme is unleashed, crowd scenes conjure mass destruction as a plot point, the staggering loss of life as a generic and inchoate jumble. Extras, whether live or digitally created, are anonymous collateral damage in a city that  The Batman  presents only as a stage for the clash of its protagonists. The movie s inability to imagine its superheroes and supervillains with any meaningful psychological identity is of a piece with the failure to imagine ordinary people with any degree of individuality. Nothing that distracts from suspense or excitement, no details of personality to get in the way of superficial identification with flattened-out heroes, nothing that suggests a world of possibilities beyond the sealed-off borders of the screen, is allowed to seep through the movie s solid and opaque surfaces. Its triumph of superficial pleasure is chillingly triumphalist.",MRW_Doc4_Batman,MRW,Sci-Fi,Negative,The Batman
114,MRW_Doc5_Batman,"Like the Nirvana song that opens and closes The Batman, there s  Something in the Way  of Matt Reeves  new film that prevents it from being a great comic book movie: it seems embarrassed to have been based on comic books.How can this be? Reeves himself has said in interviews that he and co-writer Peter Craig drew inspiration from famous Dark Knight storylines like  The Long Halloween ,  Dark Victory , and  Hush . To be clear, The Batman has no qualms about being a comic book movie. At many (many, many) points it steals liberally from the best. But the pre-release hype surrounding Warner Bros  third big-screen iteration of the Caped Crusader in two decades tells you everything you need to know about the project s drawing board flaws. Early on, fans gobbled up the prospect of a Batman who was more focused on detective work than fighting colorful villains in larger-than-life set pieces. I was one of them, especially when Ben Affleck was still attached to star in the project. Zack Snyder s gloomy superhero melange barely gave the Oscar winner anything to do, much less allow breathing room to develop his character. Affleck s version of Bruce Wayne was also middle-aged and plenty world-weary, promising a take on crimefighting we hadn t yet seen from this franchise. At some point, Affleck left the project and Robert Pattinson was tapped to strap on the utility belt. Solid choice, I thought, from an acting standpoint (post-Twilight/Harry Potter mega-fandom, Pattinson has shed the heartthrob label and consistently demonstrated his chops as a performer). But I got the sneaking suspicion that skewing the role younger would steer The Batman into origin-story territory a far too familiar place for this franchise. Still, as a lifelong comics fan, I was excited for a new Batman movie whose creative team seemed equally jazzed to share a bold vision for the movies rooted in the elements that make reading DC Comics a (mostly) rewarding experience. I m still waiting. Just after The Batman let out, I visited a nearby bookstore and flipped through the collected editions of  The Long Halloween  and  Hush . In this moment, my problems with Reeves  film came into focus. Though these storylines rely heavily on mystery and detective work,* the books themselves are vibrant as hell and full of unabashedly comic book characters. From Killer Croc to The Joker to Mad Hatter and many other  rogues, it s clear that writer Jeph Loeb and artists Tim Sale ( The Long Halloween ) and Jim Lee ( Hush ) were deeply committed to telling serious and elaborate stories with characters who might otherwise have been easily written off due to their outsized proportions and crayon box aesthetics. Reeves  Batman is anti-colorful, with scenes doused in alternating monochrome of piss yellow, jazz club blue, and  murky black (punctuated by the occasional blood red) the distinct palettes of Christopher Nolan s Dark Knight trilogy fused together into a single dour feature. I don t mind moody and oppressive films. Reeves and DP Greig Fraser give us a Gotham City we ve seen before, but never quite this run down, this desperately in need of saving. And were it not for the fact that this is a Batman movie (and therefore has at least some responsibility to dabble in the fantastical), I might have enjoyed it as a gritty urban drama. Unfortunately, one of the other early tidbits we got from the press regarding The Batman was that it was going to be more like David Fincher s Se7en than, say, Batman Returns (which, until this movie, was the gold standard for slimy, creepy Gotham flicks). In addition to being a three-hour compilation of the franchise s greatest hits (more on that in a bit), The Batman is Se7en for people who were either too young or too squeamish to actually watch Se7en. From the moral crusading serial killer leaving clues to his motives at the scenes of grisly murders; to a detective duo approaching crime from different perspectives (here, Batman is the new-on-the-job crusader while Jeffrey Wright s Jim Gordon is the seasoned cop struggling not to succumb to violence, corruption, and cynicism); and an overall mood that makes the villain s arguments for them, it s disappointing to think that the  best  way to do something new with the character is to shoehorn their universe into a subpar episode of CSI. Yes, Reeves and Craig do everything they can to make their Batman  grounded ,  real , and  contemporary  which includes demolishing the pillar of virtue on which Thomas and Martha Wayne once stood; turning the Batmobile into a regular car with some Fast and the Furious lights taped to the back, and turning iconic villains into (again, sadly) TV crime series nobodies. Before we get to Penguin and Riddler, let s look at a character who isn t (mostly) in this film: Jack Nicholson s Joker, as seen in Tim Burton s 1989 Batman, was a narcissistic criminal underboss who fell into a vat of acid and became a narcissistic (and very weird) criminal mastermind. He used lethal joy buzzers on rivals and pulled a 6-foot-long gun out of his pants. Nearly two decades later, Christopher Nolan cast Heath Ledger as the Clown Prince of Crime, and gave him a mysterious past that didn t include the acid trip (sorry). This Joker s white skin and red grin were self-styled body art, even though the ghoulish facial scarring may not have been. This step toward realism did not negate the character s over-the-top antics (like using a bazooka and dressing up as a nurse). The less said about Jared Leto s Snyderverse Joker the better, except that he d been stripped of an acid backstory and facial scarring, and reduced to a tattooed, grill-sporting albino gangsta with a thing for pretty young shrinks. I blame the success of Todd Phillips  billion-dollar, titular take on the Joker for a good deal of The Batman s problems. Joaquin Phoenix lit up the screen with his commitment to insanity and extreme dieting. But his Arthur Fleck was literally just an imbalanced Gothamite who stumbled into a life of crime and decided to decorate his face. Many fans speculated that this was a proto-version of the character, one that a future  real  Joker would emulate in taking on Batman. Whatever the case, the comics-accurate interpretation of Joker fell from the heights of Nicholson s interpretation to the barely-qualifies lows of Phoenix s just-a-guy art film. Similarly, Reeves and Craig steer far from previous interpretations of Penguin and Riddler (Paul Dano) in the name of realism. Ripping not just a page but entire chapters from David Fincher s Zodiac, the filmmakers reimagine Riddler as a personality-free, cold-blooded killer in what appears to be a black leather radiation suit with eyeglasses placed precariously on top (recalling, not kindly, Michael Myers  sheet-ghost getup from Halloween). Sure, he scribbles question marks on his outfit, crime scenes, and the chicken-scratch letters he addresses  To The Batman , but there s no flamboyance, no joy to the character. That s not to say I prefer Jim Carrey s take on the character from Batman Forever, but there s a healthy middle ground (reminder: decades of source material) between sparkly, cane-twirling Vegas Act and (again, sadly) just-a-guy art film. To see Riddler s video messages to Gotham PD/Batman is to feel none of the cold calculation of Ledger s Joker in The Dark Knight. If Riddler isn t breathing cartoonishly heavily into his microphone, he s screaming at the top of his lungs like Nic Cage meeting his Nic Cage quota. I felt the peril of Ledger/Joker s victims. I pegged Dano s Riddler as more likely to die of a heart attack than to wind up in Arkham Asylum. You may say,  But, Ian, there really are odd-looking lunatics out there who do unspeakable things while ranting on the Internet . I agree, and those people also have nothing to do with the Riddler.Now l et s consider the Penguin. It s been said that Warner Bros  spent untold amounts of money to needlessly turn Colin Farrell into Richard Kind, but in the context of The Batman, it was cash well spent. I absolutely loved what Farrell did with this part, even if I didn t recognize his character as the Penguin. Sure, he s called  the Penguin . But instead of being a deformed smoker with fused-fingered flipper hands and a genius mind to match his monocle, Oswald Cobblepot is now just a fat Sopranos-knock-off mid-boss named  Oz  who has a bit of a limp. It s true, someone nicknamed him  Penguin , but that makes about as much sense as calling Sonny Corleone  Sabertooth . At this rate, we re only six years away from seeing an unemployed college dropout version of Bruce Wayne who merely identifies as a billionaire crimefighter, taking on bad guys with  sweded  cardboard armor like Jack Black s delusional video store clerk in Be Kind, Rewind. As it stands, there s no real Bruce Wayne to speak of here, only a Bat shadow whose emo poutiness is even more pronounced when bumming around his luxury estate in black t-shirts and guyliner. And what of the man behind the cowl, the driven young billionaire who spent years studying and training all over the world in order to become what criminals fear most? I know this is only Year Two, but I don t see how this guy quashed his first drug ring let alone struck at the heart of a citywide political scandal. In Batman Forever, Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) questions the sanity of a man who would dress up as a  flying rodent  to which Batman immediately replies,  Bats aren t rodents, Dr. Meridian . In The Batman, the Riddler presents Batman with a puzzle involving a  flying rat , a challenge so gargantuan that Batman, Gordon, and Alfred the butler (Andy Serkis) spend more than an hour of screen time working their way through the world s dumbest possible answers. A flying rat? Why, that could be a penguin! Or a stool pigeon! Or a falcon! Or it could be that giant shiny metal emblem on your fricking chest. Then there s the grand third act revelation involving a Wayne family scandal. Turns out mom and dad weren t such models of stability and morals after all (another disturbing trend in the post-Dark Knight trilogy mythos). Somehow this news comes as a shock to Bruce Wayne, who never knew about the articles, blogs (hell, probably books and documentaries) written about the seedy side of his family the mental illness, the corruption scandal that nearly derailed his father s mayoral bid. I know Gotham is a  timeless  city, but they ve clearly had working Internet long enough to spawn a subculture of TikTok conspiracy nuts. If this Batman were truly the brilliant (or even competent) crimefighter we d been led to believe, then his enemies  taunts against his intellect would have bounced off him like rubber. Instead, when Riddler says,  Oh, you re really not as smart as I thought you were! , we understand why he might see this Batman as less Michael Keaton than Pete Holmes. For those expecting a real brain-bender, the kind of intellectually rewarding film one thinks of when hearing  detective movie  echoed throughout the marketing and promotion, The Batman is almost sure to disappoint. It s similar to how Captain America: The Winter Soldier was advertised as being a  different kind  of Marvel movie, a real-deal spy thriller instead of a superhero film.** The real mystery is why Batman keeps talking about vengeance. Previous iterations have centered on Bruce Wayne s war on crime as a way of protecting others from the kind of evil that befell his family. But that s  justice  an entirely different motivation than  vengeance . It s the same line of thinking that found Pamela Voorhees hacking up teenagers in Friday the 13th, after having killed the two camp counselors she blamed for the drowning death of her son. We recognize her as being insane because you can only exact revenge on the person or institution that did you wrong. Bruce learns this lesson early in Batman Begins, realizing the need to channel his rage differently after his parents  assassin is gunned down outside of court. Reeve and Craig s Batman wears  vengeance  like a misshapen emo band t-shirt it looks badass for about five minutes until you realize this guy s an adult and ought to get some smarter clothes. Some time ago I let a friend know that there was a new Batman movie coming out. They cut me off almost instantly when I mentioned Catwoman playing off of Batman and Penguin, with some corrupt businessman/politician pulling everyone s strings.  I know that movie,  they said.  Tell me about the new one.  Stop me if you heard these before: The villain assassinates a crime boss in front of a large crowd gathered on giant steps. The Riddler leaves colorful envelopes for Batman, addressed in crude, childlike writing. The villain allows themselves to be captured on purpose, as their citywide-reign-of-terror plot unfolds. A Bat vehicle appears out of the shadows, kicking off an intense, fiery car chase across Gotham. Batman solves (to varying degrees of success) a riddle about a winged rat. The film uses cute editing tricks to knock the audience off-balance during an assassination scene. Bruce has a heart-to-heart with a wounded father figure in a hospital/deathbed scenario. Batman growl-yells at the cocky, uncooperative villain in custody and proceeds to break the room apart in frustration. Batman takes out a gang of armed, faceless henchmen by tripping and hanging them from the scaffolding on which they re perched. The villain orchestrates a series of explosions around Gotham, which we see from impressive aerial vantage points, and which signify a third act plot device of infrastructural disaster. Batman takes a special liking to an orphan boy who may or may not become his future sidekick, Robin. The villain uses a public official s widely publicized funeral to stage another high-profile assassination. Batman worries that if Gotham s citizens learn their District Attorney is corrupt, it would  tear the city apart . Gotham City, especially as depicted in The Batman, is a festering hole of rising crime and dirty officials. Who are these mythical pearl-clutchers that would lose all faith in humanity by learning that the violent, prostitution-ridden streets were being enabled by a less-than-upstanding DA? Sidebar 1: Do you even know the name of your District Attorney? I mean, I do but that s only because she s been embroiled in corruption scandals for years.For as much as Warner Bros exalts Reeves  film as a detective thriller, you don t have to be a super sleuth to recognize that it s essentially  Batman s Greatest Hits  draped in a (slightly) more youth-friendly Fincher aesthetic. Much of the commentary surrounding the movie on release has been that it s unfair to compare Reeves to, say, Christopher Nolan or Tim Burton. It s completely fair, especially when so much of the screenplay has been lifted from some of the most financially successful and widely discussed superhero movies of all time.If you re thinking that the screenwriters might have been limited in the kinds of stories they can tell with these characters and situations, I can attest that, as a comic book collector for nearly 35 years, I can count the number of truly repetitive Batman stories I ve read on one hand. They re not all home runs, but the best rise to the challenge of finding new ways to invigorate a nearly 100-year-old pop icon rather than sneakily presenting watered-down versions of far better ideas. The greatest mystery is how Reeves, Craig, and the studio execs thought no one would notice. People did notice critic Ryan Kinel s reaction to The Batman, which included his taking umbrage at the depiction of white characters versus black characters. In addition to Reeves and company race-swapping traditionally white characters (Gordon and Selina Kyle aka Catwoman, played here by Zoe Kravitz), Kinel observed that, aside from Batman and Alfred, all the other white male adult characters in Gotham were villains while the black characters (including mayoral candidate Bella Re l, played by Jayme Lawson) were do-gooders. It s an exaggeration, for sure. While Catwoman is more of an ally here than we ve seen in other Bat-flicks, she s hardly virtuous. And there are several white cops and random citizens in the movie who don t appear to be evil.But there is a faint undercurrent of wokeness permeating The Batman, one that is initially annoying and eventually jarring. Midway through the film, Re l confronts the reclusive Bruce Wayne about sitting on his family fortune instead of helping those in need. As they are separated, the mayor-in-waiting makes a remark to the effect that, once elected, she ll  make  Wayne do more. That s sinister as hell, not to mention entitled, and I doubt Reeves, Craig, or anyone else responsible for inserting that creepy bit of class prejudice into the story understands that they re advocating literal coercive fascism.  The irony, of course, is that Bruce Wayne has spent years and untold millions of dollars building a crimefighting apparatus to help those very same underprivileged and/or terrorized Gothamites. He s not very good at it, but, hey The capper comes toward the end of the movie, when Catwoman directly challenges Batman, saying,  Whoever you are, you were definitely born rich"", followed by some line about taking down the  rich, white asses  whose corruption keeps everyone down. Granted, in recent years, the definition of racism has been eroded to exonerate everyone but white people, but as a mixed-race kid growing up, I can assure you my black dad would ve knocked the shit out of me for seriously discriminating against an entire group of people based on skin color. Here we see that the filmmakers  lack of originality isn t limited to story beats; it extends to ideology, too. Is the insinuation that only white people can become wealthy and powerful that everyone else must siphon or steal resources in order to get ahead? Or that minorities are incapable of being corrupt? Have Reeves and company ever actually looked at the power structures of real-world cities in the 21st Century? As with wider culture, political influence has diversified in the last few decades making Catwoman s line as out of touch as it is racist. A few days after I watched The Batman, I put on Joel Schumacher s Batman & Robin for my four-year-old son. On the commentary for that film (or maybe it was Batman Forever, I don t recall), Joel Schumacher boasts that he would constantly (an apparently very loudly) remind his actors on set,  It s a comic book! We re making a comic book movie!  I often cite this as a criticism of Schumacher s entries, which are gaudy, over-the-top, and often neglect the rich history of their own characters. I see them differently now. They re still not good films, but they at least attempt to translate the language and style of the source material to another medium. The Nolan trilogy walked a fine line between recognizable reality and heightened comic book exploits. The records-smashing Marvel films prove that audiences will wait in line for hours to watch a giant green man punch a flamboyant god of mischief and greet this weird spectacle with unironic applause. Matt Reeves strips away just about every overtly comic book element from his film except for the plot points and set pieces that he swipes from other Batman movies and shoehorns into a PG-13 take on Se7en. It s the kind of fat, clumsy imposter that a real Batman movie would tie up and leave at the scene of a crime in order to limit the damage it might do to itself and others. The Batman lacks confidence, a distinct voice, and a reason to exist.  ",MRW_Doc5_Batman,MRW,Sci-Fi,Negative,The Batman
115,MRW_Doc6_Batman,"It s been twenty years since the murder of his parents. Two since he put on the cowl. Gotham still doesn t know what to think of the costume, but the fear it has placed inside the hearts of criminals cannot be overstated. Violence only seems to increase, though, and Bruce Wayne (Robert Pattinson) wonders if his presence as a vigilante seeking vengeance has done anything beyond giving offenders another figure of  justice  to run from. Saving a helpless man from a gang on Halloween, only for the victim to plead that he not hurt him too, may prove worse with citizens seeing Batman as another operator of unchecked brute force. Why should they trust that he won t eventually turn on them? Why should they believe he s not a killer?So, despite Matt Reeves (and co-writer Peter Craig) avoiding another flashback to young Bruce watching his mother s pearl necklace break in a darkened alley, his The Batman remains an origin story. Maybe not for the figure itself, but for the hope it has yet to inspire. He is merely vengeance now because it s who he believes he must be to have an effect. Bruce verbalizes the fact that he s spent these two decades numbing himself to the fear of dying and separating himself from his family s legacy in order to relinquish any and all attachments that may hold him back. Besides Alfred (Andy Serkis as a hybrid butler/bodyguard with an emphasis on the latter insofar as training him to fight), Wayne is isolated. He s a recluse. A ghost.Batman, however, has a friend in Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright). Let s call it a mutually beneficial partnership cemented by the implementation of a bat signal that isn t quite government sanctioned. We know this because Gordon inviting Batman to the sensitive crime scene of Gotham s slain mayor on the cusp of a new election against the upstart Bella Re l (Jayme Lawson) causes eyebrows to raise and mouths to drop. Gordon has some rope with the commissioner to get away with it, but it s getting shorter and shorter with each new stunt. How could he not bring the caped crusader along, though, when the killer left behind an envelope addressed to him? In it is a riddle and cypher easily cracked to begin their descent into Gotham s corrupt soul.Reeves takes inspiration from numerous comic storylines, mixing and matching to concoct an elaborate tapestry that overflows with iconic characters in differing stages of repute. The main thread may be Batman s quest to uncover The Riddler s (Paul Dano) identity before he murders more of the city s powerful elite, but the journey towards that end is meticulously drawn so that everyone plays his/her role regardless of whether their inclusion is as a distraction, target, foreshadowing, or some combination of the lot. A web of politicians and law enforcement is exposed just as one of mobsters and entrepreneurs provides a mirrored image inside their mutual ground zero: a nightclub owned by Carmine Falcone (John Turturro). By housing DAs (Peter Sarsgaard s Colson) and cronies (Colin Farrell s Penguin) alike, the secrets abound.Is one of them The Riddler s location? Perhaps the reason why he s chosen his targets and why they deserve a public airing of their dirty laundry? Maybe. What we know for certain is that Batman has a role to play no matter how unwitting due to the perpetrator intentionally dragging his name into the investigation. Is The Riddler showing the GCPD how bad they are at their jobs by bringing the vigilante in to solve his cryptic messages? Perhaps it s an ego stroke, daring Batman to alternatively prove that he isn t up to the task either? Gordon and Wayne do always seem to be a step behind no matter how much closer they get each time. He s baiting them and they re complying at every turn. Until fate intervenes. Cue Selina Kyle (Zo  Kravitz) working her own angle against some of the parties embroiled in Batman s case. Is she friend or foe? A trusted collaborator or liability? The answer lies somewhere in the middle because it always does in Gotham. Beyond Gordon, no one here is truly adhering to the law. Whether they break it for good reasons or bad, they exist in this cesspool precisely because they know they can get away with it if their skill and luck allow. It s why we can t even look at Re l without questioning her motives. She may say the right things and promise change, but can she really bring it when those she ll need to rely upon are in the pocket of those desperate to maintain the status quo? And therein lies The Batman s core conceit: that Wayne is nothing more than a weapon indirectly wielded by both sides of the coin. He must therefore make a choice about whether his cold, calculating pragmatism is working despite it keeping him at arm s length from those he protects. Where is the line for the Bat and Bruce alike since one cannot exist without the other and neither is beyond reproach? There are some great bits of dialogue wherein Batman is called out for being exactly who he is see Selina clocking his rhetoric as that of a privileged product of wealth before he can even finish a sentence. His mission is fueled by more than grief. It s why  Batwoman s  Ryan Wilder is such a refreshing change of pace. This version of Bruce is too, though. While not being the playboy as deflection makes people not putting two and two together less believable, the whole Bruce as Kurt Cobain (it s one thing for Reeves to admit modeling him after the late singer, it s another to have Michael Giacchino use the baseline from  Something in the Way  throughout the entire score) is intriguing if only because it ensures the parallel to Riddler as an outsider/loner type is driven home harder. It can be a bit overbearing considering the plot is simple and predictable when stripped of its many false starts and stops (Reeves and Craig get full use from every character on-screen), but that s the bane of origin tales. The goal is evolution. The package is ultimately secondary. That s not to say this one s superficial. I like the dark, Zodiac-killer makeover of Riddler (Dano is certainly having fun regardless). And the ultra-realistic underbelly of Gotham with Falcone and Penguin playing ruthless gangsters rather than cartoonish eccentrics. Add Batman experiencing the brunt of his activities in ways the property rarely allows (he s knocked out twice, winded numerous times, and actually feels human) and Reeves is certainly making good on his promise for  real world  authenticity. Talk of Batman s detective work and the film s noir inspirations are grossly overblown (this is quite the rudimentary depiction of both), but there s a distinct visual flair I can get behind. And while it s not as emotive as Reeves  Apes films, the blockbuster spectacle does remain. I look forward to what s next.",MRW_Doc6_Batman,MRW,Sci-Fi,Positive,The Batman
116,MRW_Doc7_Batman,"Comic books have become the dominant source material for franchise filmmaking. There is a staggering amount of IP out there, ripe for exploration on the big screen. And yet, there are a handful of characters to which we invariably return. Characters upon whom filmmakers can t resist placing their own stamp. Few characters have seen the kind of churn that we ve gotten from Batman over the years   a churn that continues with the release of  The Batman.  Since Tim Burton s  Batman  hit in 1989, laying the groundwork for the superhero explosion that would eventually follow, we ve seen numerous artists and artisans embrace the character in their own way. Early on, we got Burton s neo-Gothic vibes and Joel Schumacher s candy-colored neon fever dreams. After that, Christopher Nolan s trilogy redefined the possibilities of what the character   and comic book movies in general   could be. Next, we got Zach Snyder s stylized grimdark take as the character was moved into a wider expanded cinematic universe. And now, Matt Reeves has entered the ring.  The Batman  promises a more grounded take on the character, moving away from the more extreme interpretations and focusing on a younger Batman, one still learning the logistical challenges and harsh realities that come with costumed vigilantism. With Robert Pattinson assuming the cowl, the film seeks to dig into the early years of the hero and his development. The film seeks to embrace verisimilitude   at least, to the extent that a movie based on a superhero comic can   and focuses more on the idea of Batman as detective, an aspect of the character that has largely been underplayed or outright ignored by previous adaptations. The result is a movie that, while uneven, offers room to evolve and expand in ways we haven t yet seen on the big screen. We meet this Batman (Pattinson) just two years into his crimefighting mission. To this point, he remains a street-level vigilante, one devoted to cleaning up the crime-riddled streets of Gotham; it s a mission reflective of that put forth by his now-deceased philanthropist father, though his methods are far removed from those exercised by Thomas Wayne. He has a complicated but ultimately mutually respectful relationship with Gotham PD lieutenant James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright), though the vast majority of Gotham s finest view the Batman as a nuisance at best and a menace at worst. Without the mask, however, he s simply Bruce Wayne, scion to a massive fortune that has been steadily dwindling in recent years. His sole confidant is Alfred Pennyworth (Andy Serkis), the man who has been by his side ever since the tragic death of his parents some two decades prior. The already-troubled city threatens to explode when a mysterious masked figure known as the Riddler (Paul Dano) begins to pick off prominent members of the community, wealthy and powerful people that the enigmatic villain sees as corrupt monsters responsible for Gotham s slow self-immolation. Meanwhile, a young woman named Selina (Zoe Kravitz) has embarked on her own mission, trying to determine what happened to a friend of hers who has disappeared. Selina works at a notorious club well-known for providing a place for power players from all sides to mingle. Said club is run by a thug known as the Penguin (Colin Ferrell), but the real string-puller is the crime boss Carmine Falcone (John Turturro). Selina   a gifted cat burglar   opts to utilize her particular set of skills to try and unravel the mystery surrounding her friend, leading to her path crossing with that of the Batman. This connection leads to the two of them connecting their goals, with the pair discovering just how deep   and how high   the city s corruption goes. Their efforts place them in the crosshairs of some very powerful people who have a vested interest in the status quo, even as an insane serial killer targets those very same powerful people. In the end, it boils down to who can be trusted   and who cannot. There s a remarkable ambition at work with  The Batman.  Most superhero movies operate on a massive scale, but this one uses that scale in a different way. Those films revolve around huge, world-shattering stakes and scale the presentation accordingly. This film s stakes are much smaller, more grounded. That s not to say they re less important or impactful, however   if anything, the lessening of the narrative bombast only increases our ability to directly connect. Matt Reeves (who along with directing the film co-wrote the script with Peter Craig) proves to be an ideal choice to shepherd this iteration of Batman. He s shown himself to be a deft hand with genre fare and IP franchise work   he wrote and directed the found-footage breakout  Cloverfield  and helmed the final two films of the excellent  Planet of the Apes  trilogy from the mid-2010s   and executed a clear and distinct vision in this film. A lot of that vision plays out in the film s, well   visuals. The aesthetic Reeves and company have created is filled with stylized structures and creeping shadows, all of it soaked in a nigh-omnipresent rain. So much of the film is steeped in darkness that even the moments filled with light carry that shadowy undertone. The stylistic influences on the film are legion and extremely present. There s a  40s noir feeling throughout, a hard-boiled vibe that informs the underlying detective story foundation of the film. But there s also a New Hollywood feel to a lot of the film, stemming from the efforts at crafting a griminess to the setting   the unseemly urban sordidness of Gotham is plucked straight from that tradition. Not to mention the fact that Reeves is unapologetically Hitchcockian in his approach throughout. Elements of paranoid thrillers and clean-up-the-streets exploitation are apparent as well. That said, this isn t pastiche   Reeves simply incorporates these elements to help fill out a world that ultimately proves to be very much his own creation. (Oh, and the music is awesome. The score, the needle drops   it s all great.) Now, you can t have a Batman movie   even one more interested in Batman as detective   without some action set pieces, and  The Batman  has some good ones. There are a handful of hand-to-hand combat moments that are beautifully executed   there s one lit almost exclusively by muzzle flash that is striking to watch   and a couple of top-notch chase scenes, as well as an explosive and complicated third act sequence that I won t spoil. Let s talk performances, which are exceptional pretty much across the board. Pattinson makes for an outstanding Batman in this context, brooding and emotionally disengaged and clearly struggling to find the dividing line between Bruce Wayne and the Caped Crusader. There s a sense of psychological disconnect to the character that Pattinson captures nicely, even as he holds his own with the physical demands. Meanwhile, Kravitz somehow gives an even better performance, endowing Selina/Catwoman with a litheness and agility reflected both in her physical presence and her dramatic connection. She oozes movie star charisma and wields it wonderfully throughout. Oh, and the chemistry between she and Pattinson is legit   the screen practically crackles when they share it. Oh, and have you seen this supporting cast? Dano is fantastic as the Riddler, somehow personalizing his menace even through a full-face mask and a digitally altered voice, using his eyes to give us a window onto the character s fractured soul. Ferrell   who is literally unrecognizable   pushes his performance with a glint-in-the-eye gleam; he is a great representation of the Penguin as aspirational mid-level thug. Turturro is largely doing his usual Turturro thing, but it suits the character well, so it works nicely. Gordon is almost always a thankless part, but Wright finds ways to bring something new to a character that often feels like an afterthought. Alas, Serkis kind of IS an afterthought; Alfred kind of gets short shrift here, but what we do get is typically solid. Oh, and we get some dynamite work from Peter Sarsgaard in a couple of scenes as well. As for the elephant in the room   the nearly three-hour runtime   all I can say is that it is remarkable how fast the time passes. I certainly didn t feel like I had been in the theater for three hours; the overall quality of every aspect kept me more than engaged enough to lose awareness of the film s length. Could it have been trimmed? Sure, but there was little included that felt actively unnecessary; perhaps we didn t need everything we got, but nothing we saw actively detracted from the experience. Personally, I don t think  The Batman  quite reaches the apex achieved by a few of its predecessors   specifically, Nolan s first two films   but it settles quite comfortably into the tier just below. And yes, there s an argument that perhaps we didn t need to reboot/revisit the character quite so soon, but hey   if we were going to get a new take anyway, then I m really glad that this is the one we got. Stylish and stark, packed with well-executed action and high-quality performances,  The Batman  is a welcome addition to the canon of the Caped Crusader. Here s hoping we get to see more of what Reeves, Pattinson and the rest have in mind. ",MRW_Doc7_Batman,MRW,Sci-Fi,Positive,The Batman
117,MRW_Doc8_Batman,"After numerous delays, The Batman has finally arrived   and it's an operatic film noir that is badass, beautiful and befitting of the character's legacy. Where Ben Affleck's Batman was in the back half of his career and Christian Bale's Dark Knight took us on a journey from origin story to his prime years, star Robert Pattinson and director Matt Reeves realize a younger, 20-something Batman, whose relationship with Commissioner Gordon (an excellently cast Jeffrey Wright) has already begun. While cleaning up the streets of petty criminals, Batman and Gordon are challenged by a serial killer who is murdering well-known political figures in the city. This killer toys with Batman, leaving word puzzles and clues addressed for his eyes only. Pattinson's Batman is complex. He's filled with the rage and strength of youth, battering his opponents with pure brawn. But his narration throughout the film, and his brief moments of dialogue, are calm and measured   a peek inside the mind of an intelligent young man struggling to determine what his role should be as Gotham's vigilante. At this stage, there isn't much distinction between Batman and Bruce Wayne. The womanizing playboy fa ade that Bruce will eventually adopt hasn't arrived yet. Instead, The Batman's Bruce Wayne is moody, sullen and kind of a weirdo (in the best possible way). Pattinson may have seemed like a curious choice at first, but in Reeves' Gotham, Pattinson's indie oddness is the perfect fit. As in all Batman films, the supporting characters are what build the world. Zo  Kravitz lends an indescribable cool factor to Selina Kyle, and she brings an interesting depth to the character that we hopefully see more of in future films. And to no one's surprise, Paul Dano is fantastic as the Riddler. His unsettling vocal inflections and boyish face create a deliciously creepy foe for Batman. Probably the most interesting of the supporting cast, though, is Colin Farrell, who plays Oswald ""Oz"" Cobblepot, the gangster who will become the notorious Penguin. In The Batman, Oz is merely a foot soldier for mob boss Carmine Falcone (John Turturro). Layered in some very impressive prosthetics, Farrell is unrecognizable as Oz. He melts into the character and brings a nuance to the Penguin that non-comic book readers may not be familiar with. The Batman is not an origin story. Reeves wisely avoids rehashing the same alleyway mugging and murder we've seen one too many times. Instead the film is a detective story that relies heavily on film noir devices (using them with great effect) coupled with gripping and fun action sequences. Batman's car chase with Oz is an all-timer. Reeves builds a gritty and visceral world that feels familiar but entirely unique. Aided by cinematographer Greig Fraser, Reeves digs into the darkness and grime of Gotham. There's a tactile stickiness to the world that clings to you and immerses you. Rounding out the filmmaking is the tremendous score by Michael Giacchino, who also composed the music for Reeves' films in the Planet of the Apes franchise. The orchestral tonality hits audiences in the chest with every beat punctuating each character's movement. Giacchino fills Gotham with a dynamic vibration that's dark and flourishing, and elevates and emphasizes the story, drawing audiences further into the world. With all due respect to Danny Elfman and Hans Zimmer, Giacchino has given us the best Batman score to date. Batman is one of the most well-known fictional characters in the world, and his story is one that has been adapted and told countless times in animated and live-action films, television and, of course, comic books. Where Reeves succeeds the most is by respecting the lore and history of Gotham and its characters while also making a version of them that is entirely his own. As of writing, no sequels have been officially announced for The Batman, but it would be a damn shame if we don't get to see more of this world and more of Pattinson's evolution as the Caped Crusader.

118,MRW_Doc9_Batman,"Matt Reeves  The Batman will likely go down as a mold-breaking movie when it comes to the current state of superhero fatigue, where at this point, most comic-book film franchises have started to blur together, not really going for a definitive style. Well, The Batman certainly does, by taking its familiar characters and settings plucked out of the page and infusing them with the dark, cynical, and heavily dramatized hallmarks of film noir detective movies, while empowering said characters to find a way out of that very darkness. It s not the first superhero movie to try this, but it s one of the first to do it this well. Unlike other re-imaginations of the  world s greatest detective,  The Batman is a story that doesn t focus much on the origins of how Bruce Wayne became Batman. It takes place just two years after Wayne took on the mantle, just now facing a new threat from rogues gallery mainstay  The Riddler,  played by Paul Dano. In The Batman, this Riddler is a mysterious serial killer meticulously taking down Gotham s corrupt political elite in the days before the city s mayoral election, justifying his murders in the name of seeking transparency and justice by any means necessary. As Batman deciphers the Riddler s cryptic correspondence with the help of clear-eyed police lieutenant Gordon (Jeffrey Wright), the film uncovers an even more pressing mystery. Is Batman, in all his pursuit of vengeance against a broken system, just as culpable of Gotham s cycle of violence as the thugs he beats down on a nightly basis? Taking another hallmark of film noir, this version of Batman doesn t see Bruce Wayne as the suave playboy, but rather a young man in constant turmoil, still processing the death of his parents and using the caped crusader as a reckless outlet for his trauma. This brooding and melancholic protagonist is excellently depicted by Robert Pattinson, who further aligns with classic noir through angsty voice narration and an increased spotlight on his detective abilities. In terms of live-action Batman stories, this narrative choice is certainly a refreshing one.  Battinson s  performance isn t the only highlight. Zo  Kravitz is stellar as Selina Kyle, a.k.a. Catwoman, balancing mystery and charm to complement the empathetic side of not just Batman, but also Gotham itself. Dano s Riddler, even while having his face covered in tape throughout most of the runtime, brings a memorable intensity to the character, to the point where his presence is felt even during long stretches when off-screen. His brutal actions are scary, to be sure, but what s perhaps scarier is how he s able to garner a following by inspiring other criminals, somewhat similar to the political underpinnings of Joker, but with more uncomfortable, menacing realism. The Batman is also a superb display of practical effects, including an exceptional how-did-they-do-this? car chase scene that puts all other Batmobile sequences to shame, with Colin Farrell delivering his own showcase as an unrecognizable Penguin. Additionally, the sound design and photography of this film s Gotham makes the city feel both alive and deeply rotted by its crime and cynicism. Screenshots of the cityscape itself deserve to be printed. The city s neon lights, soaked dark interiors, and rare inclusion of any daylight further establish this noir atmosphere on a thematic level, elevated even further by Michael Giacchino s operatic score. With a more concise runtime, The Batman could almost be considered flawless in execution. Sadly, the third act extends a bit too much, with an overlong set piece that seems out of place with the movie s more investigative mode. The final escalation is also a bit odd in its conception and abruptly transforms a nicely grounded character into an absurdist one. The basic conceit has potential, showing how one vision of justice or vengeance can spring from a deranged, counterproductive attitude. But as it plays out, the film practically stitches different acts from different movies together into one strange piece. If The Batman was only an homage to film noir that only happens to feature one of the most popular comic book characters of all time, that would be enough to dub it interesting, at least on an aesthetic level. But it pushes its own boundaries, clinically approaching the root ideas of crime and violence, not just as short-term problems to solve but systemic issues that a man in a mask can t really fix, hero or villain. In this case, the hero actually has a chance to wonder if things don t have to be this way, which is where The Batman goes from traditional noir into something more modern and hopeful. Where deeply troubled characters, including Bruce Wayne himself, doesn t have to always embrace the darkness of night when helping the city find its sunrise.",MRW_Doc9_Batman,MRW,Sci-Fi,Positive,The Batman
119,MRW_Doc10_Batman,"Director Matt Reeves brings new flavor to the Dark Knight in ""The Batman,"" an ambitious fresh take on Batman, Gotham City, and the many well-known characters who inhabit it. ""The Batman"" (co-written by Reeves and Peter Craig) is more of a detective story than a superhero movie. And rather than following the stock comic book blueprints that are today's norm, ""The Batman"" falls more in line with edgy crime thrillers like Fincher's ""Se7en"" and ""Zodiac."" In some ways it's a love letter to classic noir. Other times it plays like a hard-boiled procedural with as many bold cerebral choices as eye-popping visual ones. Robert Pattinson is the latest to don the cape and the cowl in what is the first solo nonanimated Batman movie since Nolan's 2012 ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Pattinson slides right into the dueling roles of brooding billionaire Bruce Wayne and the vigilante Caped Crusader. What's fascinating is how Reeves braids the two personas together in ways we haven't seen before. And while the Batman films are notorious for being dark, here the grim and grimy dystopian tone surrounds you in what feels like a three-hour visceral nightmare. As with most Batman stories, Gotham plays an essential role. Mixing old Gothic architecture with a dull glow of LED and neon, the dour rain-soaked design is a perfect reflection of the city's deterioration. This is a diseased Gotham with striking similarities to our modern society -- the bitter division, the rise in crime, the corrupt leadership willing to let the city burn if it means holding onto power. It's as if Reeves is holding up a mirror and asking, ""Do you see this America? This is where you're heading. Is this what you want?"" Reeves wisely bypasses the whole Batman origin story, which most people (die-hard and casual fans alike) know by heart. From the beginning, there's already a batsuit, a batmobile, a batsignal and the batcave. And Batman and Gotham PD Lt. Jim Gordon (a terrific Jeffrey Wright) are already two years into their off-the-record crime-busting partnership. Of course there are references to Thomas and Martha Wayne and how their death has shaped Bruce and given birth to the Batman. It's an essential piece to any Batman story. But Reeves is crafty in how he uses it and adds some fresh and interesting twists of his own. Fitting for a movie this bleak, the story begins with the brutal murder of Gotham City's mayor at the hands of a masked serial killer who goes by The Riddler (Paul Dano). Aside from his affection for handmade greeting cards and duct tape, Riddler has a special interest in the Batman. With each new high profile victim, the killer leaves a new riddle specifically for him. This twisted game of cat-and-mouse eats up much of the film's first half as Gordon works with Batman (much to the chagrin of many of his fellow officers) to piece together the clues before Riddler kills again. This is where the film decreases the detective angle, and Batman and Gordon's relationship takes form. But there are several other players with key roles to play. Of course you have Alfred, here played by Andy Serkis. There's Zoe Kravitz's seductive and mysterious Selina Kyle, a fresh spin on the Catwoman character with personal stakes in the game. She works at a nightclub run by Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), a powerful mob boss and drug trafficker who has most of the city's leaders on his payroll. Falcone's right-hand man is Oswald Cobblepot, aka The Penguin. He's played by an unrecognizable Colin Farrell in heavy makeup and prosthetics. It's an astonishing transformation and Farrell is an absolute scene-stealer. And then there's Dano who gives an effectively creepy spin on Riddler. There are no green spandex or persistent cackling. Dano's Riddler is a meticulous and calculated killer; a sociopath with brains and a very clear agenda in mind. His murders are detailed and with purpose, and his cold calloused pathology makes him a terrifying threat. And Dano's boyish appearance makes Riddler even more unsettling. And much like Nolan's treatment of the Joker, Reeves doesn't overuse his chief villain. He's in there just the right amount of time. The more you watch ""The Batman"" the more you appreciate the differences in Reeves' vision. For example, gone is the 'billionaire playboy' Bruce Wayne. There's a fleeting reference to it, but in this Gotham it's hard to visualize big lavish galas and hobnobbing with the elite. Much like Bruce, the people of Gotham seem beaten down by a city that's eating itself alive. Also, while this is a superhero movie per se, Reeves' Batman is far more grounded in reality. Much of it is inherent to the story, but just as much comes through Greig Fraser's moody cinematography and Michael Giacchino's epic score -- both Oscar-worthy. ""The Batman"" gives you a lot to process, but when fully considered this is a truly great addition to the character's big screen legacy. What I like best is that Matt Reeves has delivered something strikingly unique -- not only for a Batman movie but within the superhero genre as a whole. And while I wasn't initially sold on its length, the movie earns its three hour running time. Sure, you could pick apart some of Reeves' choices and find things to trim down. But doing so would cut out what makes his movie unique. And with so much potential on the horizon, I want Reeves using his creative freedom to the fullest.

90,SCP_Doc1_Equilibrium," In the first years of the 21st century, a third World War broke out. Those who survived knew that mankind could never survive a fourth; the volatile nature of human beings would only increase, ensuring continued ruination. So, with classic governmental overreach on the horizon, a new organization is formed: the Grammaton Cleric, whose elite soldiers have only one purpose   to eradicate the true source of man s inhumanity to man, which is his ability to feel.  In walks John Preston (Christian Bale), a first-class cleric, tasked with wiping out yet another stronghold of emotion and creativity   a stash house of music, art, books, and various trinkets that reflect the remnants of traditional human society. In a rather unintentionally comical moment, Preston stares down the recovered Mona Lisa painting before ordering it to be burned. In this peaceful yet bleak future, any item that might spark feelings is dubbed EC-10 or  sense offense  material, which warrants immediate destruction. A drug called Prozium is administered to citizens at regular intervals (mandated by alarm bells sounded off in the city centers and available at Equilibrium buildings), which helps suppress emotions on a personal, chemical basis. But despite all of these precautions, including Vice Counsel Dupont (Angus MacFadyen) routinely interviewing his staff, Preston s partner Errol Partridge (Sean Bean) succumbs to the forbidden, finer things in life   such as poetry by Yeats.  After discovering Partridge s indiscretions, John executes the man, betraying no emotion at all. Or does he? With each criminal he apprehends, Preston begins to realize that living without feelings negates the very reason to be alive.  It may be a complete rip-off of  1984    and by extension,  Brazil,   Gattaca,  and  The Matrix    or any of the other countless, futuristic, oppressive-regime/soul-crushing, postapocalyptic civilization movies, but  Equilibrium  is one of the better ones. If a picture is going to borrow heavily from works before it, it might as well loot from the best. It also helps tremendously that writer/director Kurt Wimmer was able to acquire such a talented cast   from Bale s efficiency as a dispassionate soldier to the high caliber of notable supporting players like Emily Watson, Sean Bean, and William Fichtner. Even child star Matthew Harbour is exceptional. Great actors, however, can t solely redeem the more mediocre materials in play.  There are plenty of overly familiar ideas, such as a Resistance, the  processing  of underground fighters, and the involvement of an unseen, supreme leader named  Father.  To counter this, there are also a few new concepts, such as the gunkata martial arts form (essentially kung-fu with shooting weapons) and the parallels of Preston s downward spiral with that of his partner (along with the well-kept secrets of his wife and children). Unfortunately, rather than exploring the thought-provoking side of fascistic rule, or the tragedies of discovering the righteousness of the opposition and failing to protect loved ones,  Equilibrium  goes for the heavy-handed approach. Shooting puppies, striking absurd poses, and abusing slow-motion for the sake of over-the-top action sequences might play up to the target audience, but these methods only work to deprive the filmmakers from realizing this project s full potential. Still, the costuming, set designs, and music (by Klaus Badelt, which is actually spectacular) are far more impressive than anyone might expect. And the finale, though riddled with excessive silliness in its choreography, possesses a few shots (particularly one that artistically cuts back to a shocking demise) that transcend the mindless action angle to glimpse the sci-fi ingenuity buried beneath.",SCP_Doc1_Equilibrium,SCP,Sci-Fi,Positive,Equilibrium

It feels uncomfortable even typing those words, as they sound like the typical soundbite blurb-speak that passes for so much of film criticism these days.

It's a movie that thrilled and moved and deeply affected me when I got the chance to see it at a very early advance screening last July, and hasn't been out of my mind in the months since. I've been heaping praise on it for so many months   to friends, colleagues, family...pretty much anyone who'd listen   that it almost feels like I've written this review already. Writer/director Kurt Wimmer has delivered an intelligent and honorable riff on such science fiction classics as George Orwell's 1984, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, and Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, presenting a not-too-distant future where freedom has been traded for security (a timely subject these days!) through the State-mandated use of emotion-suppressing drugs.

Though the film gets immeasurable mileage out of its cinematography, stunning futuristic production design, and music (an awesome neo-Wagnerian choral score by Klaus Badelt, a frequent collaborator of Hans Zimmer), it's (not surprisingly) the performers who give the proceedings so much gravity. Bale has never been better, combining the sleek coldness that served him so well as Patrick Bateman in American Psycho with a heartbreaking portrayal of a man rediscovering his lost humanity (and paying for the recovery of that humanity: Wimmer cleverly has the violence become more intense and wrenching as Preston learns to feel again). Bale is strongly supported by Emily Watson (one of the most soulful actresses working today, here perfectly cast as a beautiful sense offender who spurs Preston's rebellion against the system), Taye Diggs (having a wicked good time as Preston's suspicious partner), and Angus MacFadyen (sinister and oddly mournful as the head Clerick). This is a cast who seem to be giving their all in the service of a brilliant script, and guided all the way by a superb director. Since so much of the advance word on Equilibrium has centered around its potent action content, I feel the need to comment on that aspect: Besides being an exceptional film in any genre, it's also the action movie to beat for the year. One can easily imagine filmmakers like John Woo or the Wachowski Brothers watching Equilibrium and being stunned at how much Wimmer has upped the stakes in pure kinetic mayhem. The gunplay, hand-to-hand combat, and swordplay (yes   swordplay!) are so staggering in execution that   for this aspect alone   no self-respecting action fan can afford to miss this movie.

92,SCP_Doc3_Equilibrium,"Pilfered though it is from many superior (and not-so-superior) sources, Equilibrium has a lot more to offer than you d expect. Dimension Films (the genre branch of Miramax) sat on it for over a year before finally dumping it into a paltry 301 screens in a December death slot against the big year-end films (i.e., The Two Towers and its like). It didn t even get a chance to make back its relatively low $20 million budget   it grossed just over $1 million before disappearing from theaters in three weeks. The movie deserves far better. Equilibrium is not the most original movie to come down the pike   it s indebted to your choice of dystopian science fiction (1984, Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, The Matrix, Gattaca)   but it s a sleek and forceful film of its kind, with some of the most eye-boggling gunfight scenes in recent memory. They re not even gunfights   they re more like systematic gun massacres, begun and finished in an eyeblink, with shooter and targets close enough to kiss. John Preston (Christian Bale), a  Grammaton Cleric  (i.e., assassin for the government), does far more shooting than kissing. John is one of the black-clad enforcers of the new world order: in the post-WWIII fascist state of Libria, it has been determined that war and violence can be blamed solely on emotion, so all emotions have been outlawed. Scruffy bands of resistance fighters, who have refused to take their daily dose of the emotion-killing drug Prozium, gather together to appreciate art, music, film   contraband works of beauty (which are illegal because they inspire feeling). John is a complete moral and emotional blank, which means he s the best at his job, and his two children, raised (like him) on a steady diet of Prozium, are likewise empty. John was married once, but his wife became a  sense offender,  rebelling against the emotionless world, and was summarily executed while John stood nearby, not bothered in the slightest. Such a man could never carry a movie if there weren t a change of heart   or, in John s case, an introduction of heart   in store for him. Christian Bale plays the early scenes almost as a sequel to his dead-zone Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, as if Bateman had finally found his niche as a callous destroyer in the bleak world of Libria and was handed a badge and a gun. But little by little, emotion invades his shell. His partner Partridge (Sean Bean) succumbs to the poetry of Yeats; John neutrally pulls Partridge s plug, but with the tiniest flicker of doubt ( I ll do what I can to see that they go easy on you,  he says, an odd sentiment for someone supposedly without sentiment). Later, John drops one of his Prozium capsules, but instead of getting a replacement, he begins to have feelings. Some viewers may complain that John, conveniently for the plot, has an emotionally tough day ahead of him the same morning he goes Prozium-free; but he may have had many days just like it while cushioned from the emotional drain. Writer-director Kurt Wimmer gives us the same future-noir premise that served Steven Spielberg well in Minority Report   in both, a seasoned and skilled cog in the machine is content to work unquestioningly within the system, until the system turns on him. With a dash of wit, Wimmer even gives John a cute puppy to contend with, not to mention Emily Watson (in what amounts to an extended cameo) as Mary, a  sense offender  whose Beethoven record touches John s underused soul, just like Alex in A Clockwork Orange. Fortunately, there s no strained romance in the works for John and Mary, just the smallest tremors of suppressed attraction (mostly his for her), and in any event her character serves chiefly as the doorway to the larger resistance movement, led by William Fichtner as a man who can feel, but has chosen not to allow himself to. Lots of ideas bounce around in this paranoid fantasy, and lots of implausibilities, too. (Wouldn t John and his fellow Clerics be subjected to regular blood or urine tests to be sure they re on their Prozium? Wouldn t there be a more high-tech way of sniffing out emotion than a polygraph test, which can be faked out?) But Equilibrium is still an engaging ride, with some quicksilver moves in store for the climax, including a swordfight between John and suspicious new partner Taye Diggs, and a swirling ballet of gunplay between John and Libria higher-up Angus MacFadyen. Many praised The Matrix for combining deep-dish philosophy and kick-ass anime style, but it s the underseen Equilibrium that really delivers the goods.

93,SCP_Doc4_Equilibrium,"""Equilibrium'' would be a mindless action picture, except that it has a mind. It doesn't do a lot of deep thinking, but unlike many futuristic combos of sf and f/x, it does make a statement: Freedom of opinion is a threat to totalitarian systems. Dictatorships of both the left and right are frightened by the idea of their citizens thinking too much, or having too much fun. The movie deals with this notion in the most effective way, by burying it in the story and almost drowning it with entertainment. In a free society many, maybe most, audience members will hardly notice the message. But there are nations and religions that would find this movie dangerous. You know who you are. The movie is set in the 21st century--hey! that's our century!--at a time after the Third World War. That war was caused, it is believed, because citizens felt too much and too deeply. They got all worked up and started bombing each other. To assure world peace and the survival of the human race, everyone has been put on obligatory doses of Prozium, a drug that dampens the emotions and shuts down our sensual side. (Hint: The working title of this movie was ""Librium."") In the movie, enforcers known as Clerics have the mandate to murder those who are considered Sense Offenders. This is a rich irony, since True Believers, not Free Thinkers, are the ones eager to go to war over their beliefs. If you believe you have the right to kill someone because of your theology, you are going about God's work in your way, not His. Christian Bale stars in ""Equilibrium,"" as Cleric John Preston, partnered with Partridge (Sean Bean) as a top-level enforcer. Nobody can look dispassionate in the face of outrageous provocation better than Bale, and he proves it here after his own wife is incinerated for Sense Offenses. ""What did you feel?"" he is asked. ""I didn't feel anything,"" he replies, and we believe him, although perhaps this provides a clue about his wife's need to Offend. Preston is a top operative, but is hiding something. We see him pocketing a book that turns out to be the collected poetry of W.B. Yeats, a notorious Sense Offender. He has kept it, he explains, to better understand the enemy (the same reason censors have historically needed to study pornography). His duties bring him into contact with Mary O'Brien (Emily Watson), and he feels--well, it doesn't matter what he feels. To feel at all is the offense. Knowing that, but remembering Mary, he deliberately stops taking his Prozium: He loves being a Cleric, but, oh, you id. If ""Equilibrium"" has a plot borrowed from 1984, Brave New World and other dystopian novels, it has gunfights and martial arts borrowed from the latest advances in special effects. More rounds of ammunition are expended in this film than in any film I can remember, and I remember ""The Transporter."" I learn from Nick Nunziata at CHUD.com that the form of battle used in the movie is ""Gun-Kata,"" which is ""a martial art completely based around guns."" I credit Nunziata because I think he may have invented this term. The fighters transcribe the usual arcs in mid-air and do impossible acrobatics, but mostly use guns instead of fists and feet. That would seem to be cheating, and involves a lot of extra work (it is much easier to shoot someone without doing a back-flip), but since the result is loud and violent it is no doubt worth it. There is an opening sequence in which Preston and Partridge approach an apartment where Offenders are holed up, and Preston orders the lights to be turned out in the apartment. Then he enters in the dark. As nearly as I could tell, he is in the middle of the floor, surrounded by Offenders with guns. A violent gun battle breaks out, jerkily illuminated by flashes of the guns, and everyone is killed but Preston. There is nothing about this scene that even attempts to be plausible, confirming a suspicion I have long held, that the heroes of action movies are protected by secret hexes and cannot be killed by bullets. There are a lot more similar battles, which are pure kinetic energy, made of light, noise and quick cutting. They seem to have been assembled for victims of Attention Deficit Syndrome, who are a large voting block at the box office these days. The dispassionate observer such as myself, refusing to Sense Offense my way through such scenes, can nevertheless admire them as a technical exercise. What I like is the sneaky way Kurt Wimmer's movie advances its philosophy in between gun battles. It argues, if I am correct, that it is good to feel passion and lust, to love people and desire them, and to experience voluptuous pleasure through great works of music and art. In an early scene Cleric Preston blow-torches the 'Mona Lisa,' the one painting you can be pretty sure most moviegoers will recognize. But in no time he is feeling joy and love, and because he is the hero, this must be good, even though his replacement partner, Cleric Brandt (Taye Diggs), suspects him, and wants to expose him. The rebel group in ""Equilibrium"" preserves art and music (there is a touching scene where Preston listens to a jazz record), and we are reminded of Bradbury and Truffaut's ""Fahrenheit 451,"" where book lovers committed banned volumes to memory. One is tempted to look benevolently upon ""Equilibrium"" and assume thought control can't happen here, but of course it can, which is why it is useful to have an action picture in which the Sense Offenders are the good guys.

94,SCP_Doc5_Equilibrium,"What a dumb, fun, curiously adolescent movie this is. The premise is straight out of a 13-year-old's creative writing book: ""What if, like, in a futuristic world, right, ""feeling"" was illegal!"" Yep, it's that stupid. But surrender to inherent idiocy and there's entertainment to be had. The dystopian setting is Libria - a concrete jungle where a fascistic government maintains peace by eliminating anger, sorrow, joy, or love destroying all art and literature and issuing regular doses of a suppressant called Prozium (hang on, that sounds a bit like... Prozac! Genius). Chief among the state enforcers is cleric John Preston (Christian Bale) - a highly-trained drone, prone to shooting anyone who shows the slightest sign of happiness, sadness, etc. God help you if you read poetry. If they're not shot, then ""sense offenders"" are sent to be incinerated - a fate which befell Preston's wife years before, only he was too deadened and dedicated to care. When he falls for Emily Watson's feisty rebel, however, he finally starts to see sense (badaboom!) and considers joining the resistance... So, a repressive future world where a man rises from zero to hero with the help of chic black clothing and big guns, then... It's ""The Matrix: Rehashed"". Well, yeah, but who cares? ""Equilibrium"" lifts from several genre classics - from ""Metropolis"" to ""Brazil"" - with the same unashamed zeal. If only other derivative flicks were this well-shot and cast. Wimmer's script is occasionally laughable (the underground resistance is literally underground; Preston is finally shocked into full emotion by a cute, lil' puppy dog), but he's a keen visual stylist. The grim cityscape impresses and the production design is striking. The adolescent attitude stretches to the frenetic, thunderous action sequences - which favour spectacle over sense to explosive effect. All this and a Brian Conley cameo. What's not to love?

95,SCP_Doc6_Equilibrium,"A tedious rip-off sci-fi film, itching to be another Matrix (or, maybe just a bearable flick!), that brazenly steals everything from Orwell s 1984 novel and many other thinking man s films, with the same Dystopian agenda, such as Fahrenheit 451. It offers for the viewers of the more low rent sci-fi films the required martial-arts fight sequences and plenty of metallic techno gadgetry; and, it appeals to a more arty audience by its cleverly created totalitarian gothic set design of mixing actual Berlin locations with CGI effects. Nevertheless, it fails overall to arouse interest dramatically, conceptually or inventively. I ve seen this film s theme played out too often (and in a more spirited way) in recent films to find its well-intentioned virtues necessarily welcome or pleasing. It only adds unneeded celluloid to an increasingly tired genre!  Director-writer Kurt Wimmer (1995- One Man s Justice ), a screenwriter for such films as the 1998- Sphere,  the 1999- The Thomas Crown Affair  and the 2003- The Recruit,  never got this  baby  off the ground. The banal dialogue was risible (a prime example has the humanist heroine played by Emily Watson in all seriousness state:  Without love, breath is just a clock ticking ), the main action hero, Christian Bale, was miscast. His stiff actions were too self-conscious and deliberate to fill the role of an action hero. The bleak settings were uninspiring; the overall grey effect was more stunting than enlightening. What becomes most annoying is that it strings together a bunch of clich s from just about every sci-fi film and the melodrama never becomes anything more than a silly exercise in acting silly. It s a film that, quite frankly, offers little entertainment value or much of anything else (it even fails to answer most of the challenging questions it raises about state-controlled suppression).  Equilibrium takes place in a futuristic world in the 21st-century post-WWIII. It resembles a fascist state where books are burned and no emotions are allowed in the belief this will prevent an uprising and another world war. John Preston (Christian Bale) is the highest ranking Grammaton ninjalike cleric in Libria, where he s a police enforcer (using a new fight technique called  Gun-Kata ) going on missions to root out all rebels who haven t taken their required daily dose of the emotion suppressing Prozium; and, he s also around to rid the world of literature, art and sentimental relics of the past. Preston catches cleric partner Partridge (Sean Bean) sneaking off with a book of poetry by WB Yeats, and turns him over to the state authorities. Partridge s expected fate is as doomed as Preston s wife, who was executed for Sense Offences (leaving him a widower with two children, one of them training in the monastery to be a cleric). But the tricky Partridge before he departs this dystopia, tells his robotic partner  I spread my dreams under your feet.   Before you can say  let s burn some more books  all of the following things happen to Preston: he s given a new uptight cleric partner, Brandt (Taye Diggs), who may be able to read his mind, he s impressed with the unrepentant sense offender he arrested Mary O Brien (Emily Watson), and he s letting some feelings into his hard interior as he takes pity on a stray puppy. This leads him to tell his big boss, Dupont (Angus MacFadyen), he wants to go after and permanently wipe out the underground movement (those that have stopped taking their drugs and are trying to save the items that have been banned). But Preston has become converted to the rebel s side by the feelings seeping through him, and he now aims to kill his society s leader Father (another way of saying Big Brother) with the help of the underground workers, and therefore hopes by contacting the rebels it will lead to a revolution.",SCP_Doc6_Equilibrium,SCP,Sci-Fi,Negative,Equilibrium
96,SCP_Doc7_Equilibrium,"Matrixian, Orwellian, and boneheadian, Equilibrium is a portentous sci-fi thriller of recycled ideas about a near future when no one is allowed to own any personal effects   including but not limited to books, perfume, DVDs of  The Matrix,  or emotions. The only accoutrement a citizen of Libria needs is a sleek palm-size case containing ampoules of a liquid sense-deadener called Prozium and a gunlike injector; the primary responsibility of a docile citizen is to vaccinate himself regularly against the dangerous threat of caring. To dodge one s dosage is punishable by death.  As a highly trained enforcer in this pharmacological dystopia, John Preston (Christian Bale) is chief thug, skilled at a snappy, highly art-directed, gun-toting form of Hong Kong-style martial arts. When Preston misses a hit of Prozium, however, he comes undone. Flooded with unfamiliar feelings, including an attraction to a  sense offender  played by Emily Watson and an empathy with the Librian resistance led by William Fichtner, the  American Psycho -faced dude becomes a kind of double agent, surreptitiously supporting the underground while trying to pass as emotionless to evade the scrutiny of his enforcer partner, Taye Diggs.  A student so inclined could have a fine, obsessive time linking images and action sequences to all the influences (including  1984,   Fahrenheit 451,  and  Brave New World ) that have been scooped up wholesale by writer-director Kurt Wimmer, stirred in an often violent frenzy, and microwaved for serving.  Equilibrium  wants to be about the importance of inextinguishable individuality in a conformist society that overvalues staying calm and driving fast.

97,SCP_Doc8_Equilibrium,"Gradually, the spoiled brat (Seung-Ho Yoo) and the deaf, exquisitely patient grandmother (Eul-Boon Kim) grow to love and understand each other. By the time his mother returns to claim him, the boy has learned more from the old woman's gestures of kindness than his mother ever taught him.  So goes ""The Way Home,"" a sweet, unabashedly sentimental tale from Korean director Jeong-Hyang Lee. Set in a tiny mountain village where time passes slowly, it's a film about love and trust and shifting emotions. Nothing much happens -- boy gets haircut, boy makes new friends -- the action is all emotional, under the surface.  ""The Way Home"" draws an aura of authenticity from the locations, from the villagers who were cast as extras and especially from 78-year-old Eul-Boon Kim,  a mountain woman who not only had never acted before but also had never seen a film.  Severely bent from years of carrying water and other burdens up twisting mountain paths, Kim doesn't need to act or affect anything at all.

98,SCP_Doc9_Equilibrium,"There's been a long-running debate about whether various forms of mass media entertainment affect today's youth and even older viewers in negative ways. While there will probably never be a definitive answer to that, it's surprising that some faction hasn't lumped novels, plays and even classic artwork with music, movies, TV shows and videogames as the roots of all that is evil. After all, they also affect the consumer's senses and emotional state of being. In writer/director Kurt Wimmer's purported cautionary sci-fi tale of such cause and effect reactions and mindsets, the people of the future have taken extreme measures to prevent art and emotions from causing yet another world war. After all, the likes of Eminem, the Osbournes and even Carrot Top obviously managed to cause all of the world's various wars hundreds and thousands of years before those artists were even around (talk about far-reaching subliminal effects).  Accordingly, the futuristic government has decided that to prevent future violence, they have to destroy all such artwork and mow down anyone and everyone remotely associated with it. That's because guns don't kill people, artwork apparently does, although the guns here are doing a far better job than Beethoven or the various tacky knickknacks on display.  That's one of the problems and inconsistencies with Wimmer's story. Simply put, the logic is flawed and all screwy. The ""police"" -- who are empowered to find and destroy all art and those who own it to prevent violence -- show emotion in killing many, many people (as does their leader).  Then there's the fact that the emotion-deadening drug that everyone's supposed to take is self-administered rather than government controlled. Those and various other flaws and lapses in logic could have been fixed with a few tweaks of the old script (such as making the drug addictive so that everyone wants and/or has to take it, especially if missing one does could potentially undermine the government).  Yet, Wimmer (director of ""One Tough Bastard"" and writer of ""The Thomas Crown Affair"") seems far more interested in fashioning ""Matrix"" style action sequences rather than the thought-provoking sci-fi allegory that this acts like it's going to be.  While some of those scenes end up being somewhat entertaining and fun in a campy and guilty pleasure sort of way, they clearly can't save the production. They certainly don't alleviate another of the film's bigger problems and that's its predictable nature and been there, seen that familiarity.  For starters, the film retreads similar, over-reactionary themes found in other sci-fi works such as ""1984"" and ""Fahrenheit 451."" Then, once the premise is established, one quickly sees that the story is going to be heading down a similar route to that found in other sci-fi films such as ""Logan's Run"" and ""Minority Report.""  Namely, that is that the central enforcer, who's so good at what he does, suddenly finds himself on the other side of the law and those with whom he works. His former partner then sets out to bring him down as the protagonist sees the errors of his ways as well as the society in which he operated.  To make matters worse, Wimmer doesn't really do anything innovative or interesting after that setup. Beyond the various ""Matrix"" style fight and shoot 'em up moments including the inevitable big showdown between the former partners, there just isn't much to engage the viewer's mind or heart.  As the converted hero on the run, Christian Bale (""Reign of Fire,"" ""American Psycho"") is decent playing the physical requirements of the role. Even so, he can't do much with the weakly written dramatic and emotional material. One can imagine any number of ways someone would react to experiencing emotions for the first time (presumably in their lives), but Bale doesn't do much in registering that. Since we don't care about his character, transformation or resultant predicament and/or goal, there's no reason to get into the story or behind his character.  Taye Diggs (""Brown Sugar,"" ""The Best Man"") doesn't have to worry about that latter aspect, as there's none of that offered for his character. Instead, he's present just as an amalgamation of most any tough guy tracker ever brought to the screen.  For such a mess of a film, Wimmer managed to assemble a rather impressive supporting cast. Although he's not present for long, Sean Bean (""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"" ""Don't Say a Word"") appears as the original partner, while William Fichtner (""Black Hawk Down,"" ""The Perfect Storm"") plays a rebel leader. Emily Watson (""Red Dragon,"" ""Punch Drunk Love"") shows up as a captured dissident and Angus MacFadyen (""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,"" ""Titus"") plays the power-hungry second-in-charge. While decent in their parts, they unfortunately can't do much with their characters as they're written.  With too much emphasis on the stylishly shot fight and action sequences rather than the sci-fi or even human elements, the film is all flash and little substance, even when it pretends to be interested in the latter. Flawed in all sorts of ways, the unbalanced ""Equilibrium"" rates as just a 3 out of 10.",SCP_Doc9_Equilibrium,SCP,Sci-Fi,Negative,Equilibrium
99,SCP_Doc10_Equilibrium,"Requisite opening text-crawl-plus-windy-voiceover informs us that once again, World War III has happened, wreaking such devastation that survivors have surrendered all control to the Grammaton Cleric, a mysterious authority whose strictures are designed to prevent WWIV. He/it has determined that man s inhumanity to man is fueled by his ability to feel. Hence everybody s on heavy doses of Prozium, which makes them think and behave in a neutral, obedient fashion.  Subsidiary clericks like top-of-class John Preston (Christian Bale) are trained to intuit signs of sense offenses, thereby ferreting out persons who read books, look at paintings, listen to music, hide pre-Grammaton memorabilia, go off medication, or otherwise dare forbidden emotions.  Offenders are invariably executed; one such was Preston s own wife, some years ago. The occasional nostril twitch suggests he perhaps wasn t as hunky-dory with that event as he claims, though grade-school-aged son Robbie (Matthew Harbour) appears to be developing just fine into a droning little fascist-snitch.  It s unclear just how much of civilization is left, or even if there are other cities outside pic s Librya. There are pockets of illegal dissent beyond town limits, however, in a zone known as the Nethers. John & Co. are frequently dispatched there to break up radical cells and torch their verboten booty.  In a sequence that sets the somber-silly tone,  Equilibrium s  first such raid uncovers   wouldn t ya know it   the original Mona Lisa! To which blowtorch is immediately applied.  When his clerick-ing workmate commits suicide rather than be exposed as a Yeats-reading sense offender, John gets a new partner. Brandt (Taye Diggs) is a by-the-book squealer who immediately suspects Preston of harboring illicit ideas. Indeed, protag has stopped taking his Prozium, and is fishing about trying to join the resistance. Still keeping up the good front, he regretfully takes part in the bust of free-thinker Mary O Brian (Emily Watson, utterly wasted in just a few scenes), who sees him for the sensitive soul he s secretly becoming.  In this supposedly far-advanced society, plot holes are widened by the apparent nonexistence of bullet-proof vests or phone call tracing. Among numerous absurdities is Mary marching like Joan of Arc (or a volcano-sacrificed jungle virgin) to her sentenced doom, an event prompting Preston to declare,  She s scheduled for combustion!  Or a final digitized robo-t ai chi-fu face-off between hero and chief nemesis (Angus MacFayden) that looks a whole lot like patty-cake. Much of the ultimately-inspirational nonsense is drenched in the ominous, then heavenly choirs of Klaus Bedelt s score, which doesn t get the joke, either.  Reminiscent of  Gattaca  some years back,  Equilibrium  gets away acceptably with doing  the future  on a medium budget by focusing on utilitarian, bureaucratic and/or desolate landscapes, with gray the primary color. F/x and animation aspects are OK, though fight trickery that worked for  Matrix  and certain imitators doesn t work here. Wimmer (a scribe on  The Thomas Crown Affair  and other titles whose sole prior helming job was on little-seen  95 action B  One Tough Bastard ) maintains a sledgehammer pace that doesn t leaven, or vary, increasingly preposterous narrative.  Still striking poses and flexing steely face muscles in  American Psycho  fashion   albeit without the ironic context   Bale cannot claim this as one of his finer thesping days. Curiously, Diggs  perf pays little heed to the general show no emotion rule, hitting inappropriately loose and sarcastic notes that contradict his role as a humorless watchdog.

60,KLD_Doc1_AngelHasFallen,"The sleepy, dopey action bonanza  Angel Has Fallen  is disappointing, and not just for the reasons you might expect. Being the second sequel to  Olympus Has Fallen,   Angel Has Fallen  doesn t even have a high bar to clear.  Olympus Has Fallen  was a by-the-numbers revenge-fantasy about ruthless North Koreans and emasculated, savior-thirsty Americans that s mostly distinguished by its considerable displays of over-the-top violence. Basically, America is graphically imperiled for the sake of confirming a slogan coined by then-interim President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman):  As a nation, we are never stronger than when we are tested.   Olympus Has Fallen  is, at the very least, a credible survivalist wet dream. In that movie, America is (temporarily) made great again, but only after the Washington Monument is toppled, the President is tied up, and the Secretary of Defense is punched in the face and kicked in the belly, right before she s dragged across the floor as she defiantly screams the Pledge of Allegiance. To defeat the North Koreans, Banning does what no officially sanctioned US agents can: he kills a bunch of bad guys without any remorse or reprisal, like the North Korean hostage that he shoots in the head, just to spook the other North Korean agent he has tied up ( Your friend seemed like a funny guy ).  Olympus Has Fallen  isn t a good movie, but I couldn t stop watching it. By contrast: I couldn t wait to stop watching  Angel Has Fallen,  an indifferently assembled cash-in shot with way too many shaky, unfocused close-ups which seem designed to re-assure viewers of this otherwise bland drama s surface-deep intensity. Being a timid lament about contemporary American trust issues (the Russians are to blame, but almost incidentally),  Angel Has Fallen  sics Banning now rickety from concussion-induced migraines and insomnia on a group of disloyal American mercenaries led by, well, you ll figure that part out soon enough. The makers of  Angel Has Fallen  don t seem to care as much about their characters like their predecessors did. Instead, we get a few tentative signs of introspection from Banning he s sick, has a family to protect, and an estranged dad, too! that are immediately glossed over for the sake of pumping up a few flat set pieces that hail from the Tony Scott School of Frenzied Action Filmmaking, only they re not as dynamic or good-looking as Scott s jittery photography. If you re going to be mean-spirited and exploitative, at least do it convincingly. The makers of  Angel Has Fallen  struggle most when they have to make Banning look like a rebel who also knows that he must inevitably  ride a desk  to retirement. Their version of Banning is more like John McClane in  A Good Day to Die Hard  than in  Die Hard 2: Die Harder.  He complains (and periodically shows symptoms) of the action-movie equivalent of PTSD, but never succumbs to those ailments, especially not when he needs to cut through handcuffs, light up a phalanx of armed mercs, or run away strategically. This is apparently what life is like for a trained ex-soldier: a sad, vague awareness of your own mortality that s mostly off-set by shoot-outs, drone attacks, and improvised explosions that confirm your megalomaniacal sense of self-worth. After all, Banning s got an important job to do: protect Trumbull, a steadfast leader who vows to never rush our nation into war, but also wants us to be ready in case it s ever Boom Boom Go Time. Banning s moral righteousness sharply contrasts with the movie s immoral, Russia-colluding baddies, all of whom sell out their country because they miss going to war and also really like money. I d care more about Banning and his values if his creators had invested more care into their movie s action scenes, dialogue, characterizations, and basic plot. The editing and sound design is fine enough, but that s about it. Close-ups of Butler's and Freeman s blotchy-but-determined faces only hammer home the movie s general please-like-me desperation, as do action scenes that over-stress smoke, gunfire flashes, and flying debris instead of choreography, visual coherence, or human personality. Even the scenes where Banning s dad (no spoilers!) blows up some faceless goons somehow feel perfunctory and underwhelming. These key moments, like any scene featuring great character actors like Tim Blake Nelson and Lance Reddick, are raced through with negligible conviction and even less inspiration. If this type of no-brow entertainment is your thing, you may find something to like in  Angel Has Fallen,  but that doesn t mean you need what these guys are reselling.",KLD_Doc1_AngelHasFallen,KLD,Action,Negative,Angel Has Fallen
61,KLD_Doc2_AngelHasFallen," Angel Has Fallen  marks the third time that Gerard Butler, as the Secret Service agent and scowling samurai cowboy Mike Banning, has had to rescue the President of the United States from an international conspiracy so cuckoo bananas that the movie barely expects you to believe it. (Actually, in the six years since this series launched, the bar for what people will believe has been lowered. For all I know, fans of the  Fallen  films think they re based on true stories.) In  Olympus Has Fallen  (2013) and  London Has Fallen  (2016), the president was portrayed by Aaron Eckhart, who came off like a testy press secretary from the  West Wing  days. (Eckhart is a good actor with a terse appealing manner, but he s not exactly presidential.) In  Angel Has Fallen,  the role of Leader of the Free World reverts back to Morgan Freeman, who has played it approximately 47 times   or, at least, it feels that way. Seeing him back in the Oval Office is as comfy and reassuring as slipping into a daydream where Barack Obama is still president. Banning is now getting on a bit, suffering from chronic pain caused by a concussion and other woes he secretly medicates, lest anyone, from his wife (Piper Perabo) to the president, ask him to quit. He s in line for the job of director of the Secret Service, but it s a desk jockey gig. Butler s squint tells you how he feels about that one. The plot   which is to say, the plot against the president   is, once again, a violently overwrought confection of  topical  comic-strip ludicrousness; that s the DNA of the  Fallen  series. Yet when you re watching a big-budget B-movie, there s good preposterous and there s bad preposterous. Good preposterous is the setup of  Angel Has Fallen : Banning, the most loyal and trusted agent of President Allan Trumball (Freeman), is out guarding him on a winter afternoon fishing excursion when a vehicle pulls up in the woods and launches what looks like a flock of black birds. They are drones, equipped with smart bombs and computerized facial-recognition software, and as they fly low and target their prey, the explosions pile up with a satisfyingly surgical but relentless precision. In minutes, the 18 Secret Service agents hovering on the shore are all dead. And Mike? He s alive because the drones purposefully avoided him. He pulls Trumball under the water, and the result of this action is that the president is soon laying in a coma in a Washington, D.C., hospital. Mike, after a brief spell of unconsciousness himself, escapes, and it doesn t take long for the film to tell us what we already know: that he was spared by the bad guys so they could make him the fall guy.With its over-the-top premise set in motion,  Angel Has Fallen    as in, the president s guardian angel is out of commission   gets down to the business of asking us to suspend our disbelief in far less entertaining ways. If you want to know what bad preposterous looks like (or, to be generous, let s call it mediocre preposterous), check out the scenes in which Mike reunites with his father, Clay Banning, a grizzled Vietnam veteran living off the grid in a West Virginia shack, like a cross between the Unabomber and the most clich  crazy war vet you ve ever seen. There s a certain amusement in watching the 78-year-old, scraggly-white-bearded Nick Nolte rasp out survivalist hokum like  You stay attached to their tentacles, they own you for life!  Yet one of the upshots of a movie like  Angel Has Fallen  is that we re becoming a nation of closet militia fantasists. At the preview showing I attended, the audience applauded after the scene in which Nolte detonates, by remote-control trigger, an unending wall of bombs he has rigged in the woods by his home. It looks as if he was waiting to be attacked by an army. (Mike s predicament has justified his existence.) Gerard Butler showed signs of becoming a more riveting actor in last year s  Den of Thieves  (sharp dialogue becomes him), but  Angel Has Fallen  is yet another movie that turns him into a monosyllabic granite-souled neo-Bronson. It reduces him, in the process, to being a macho lox. As staged by director Ric Roman Waugh, the film s hand-to-hand combat is so routine it s deadening   and, for that matter, so is its assault-rifle-to-assault-rifle combat. At times, with Banning in the role of unjustly pursued renegade, the whole thing plays like a generic  Bourne  knockoff. It has been made to look like Mike colluded with the Russians to assassinate the president (the proof is the $10 million payoff deposited in a private account in his name). That s one of several pseudo-relevant tidbits the film tosses into the blender, along with the privatization of the defense industry and a vice president (Tim Blake Nelson, looking like a member of Herman s Hermits) who s more hawkish than his boss. Bad preposterous is watching the villain who orchestrated the whole thing bark out his psycho orders by placing a cell-phone call, with voice disguised, from a certain office. A place that s equipped with one or two minor security systems. The film s other heavy is played by an actor with a velvet manner who gets cast in this honorable-gent-who-turns-out-to-be-a-serpent role so often that his very presence, in a movie like this one, amounts to a spoiler. It s at around the time that President Trumball emerges from his coma that  Angel Has Fallen  loses what s left of its brain. An FBI agent, played by Jada Pinkett Smith, has been trailing the truth, but now we re supposed to believe that a conspiracy to remove the president, broadcast across global media, has failed to mobilize the nation s defense machinery. The whole movie comes down to two S.W.A.T. teams facing off to the death; just when you re sure that their combat can t go on anymore, it stretches out for another 15 minutes. That s bad preposterous, but maybe, for some, it can still work as an escape from the preposterous depths to which the real American presidency has fallen.",KLD_Doc2_AngelHasFallen,KLD,Action,Negative,Angel Has Fallen
62,KLD_Doc3_AngelHasFallen,"In 2013 audiences were first introduced to Secret Service Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler; The Phantom of the Opera) when he protected the White House and the President of the United States in Olympus Has Fallen.  Three years later he returned to the character once again in the sequel, London Has Fallen.  This year the third installment in the trilogy made its way to theaters when Angel Has Fallen debuted on August 23, 2019.  Just in time for the Black Friday sales rush, the movie makes its way to stores on 4K, Blu-ray, DVD and Digital.  At two hours long this action/drama will be a great stocking stuffer for fans of the franchise. Mike Banning has been a secret service agent for a long time and with the news that Director David Gentry (Lance Reddick; The John Wick Trilogy) is planning to retire many feel Banning would be next in line for the job.  It's only natural then that Banning's military buddy, Wade Jennings (Danny Huston; X-Men Origins: Wolverine), who now owns a tactical training facility, asks Banning to consider his company for government jobs.  While Mike promises to do so, he isn't exactly certain he really wants the Director's job. A few days later, while on a fishing retreat, The President (Morgan Freeman; The Shawshank Redemption) is attacked by drones and the whole secret service team guarding him are killed besides Banning.  The next day Banning's DNA is discovered inside an abandoned van that was used for the attack.  The FBI arrests Banning and accuses him of trying to assassinate the President. While Banning knows he is being set up, he needs to figure out by whom and the motive for framing him. Once Banning manages to put all the pieces together he must find a way to save the President and bring the guilty parties, including his friend Jennings, to justice. Banning is a recurring role for Butler because generally he plays it well.  This time though, as the main focus of the plot, Butler seems too calm and collected.  Even though he was trained to deal with unfortunate situation, it would have been nice to see more emotion from him as he is accused of a crime he didn't commit.  Freeman is once again wonderful as the elder statesman who brings a regality to the Commander in Chief.  Nick Nolte (48 Hours) is perfectly cast as Mike's ""off the grid   antigovernment"" father and Jada Pinkett-Smith (The Matrix Reloaded) is bad ass   when isn't she?   as FBI agent Thompson assigned to investigate Banning and the attempt on the President's life. The Dolby Vision High Definition Resolution kicks into high gear on this release.  Details are sharp, colors and crisp and the overall video quality is pristine.  The Dolby Atmos audio is spot on as well.  Sound effects are punched up and dialogue is clean with no noise at all.

Angel Has Fallen isn't quite as the same level as the previous two films but the shift from a location to a person taking a ""fall"" made for a new twist on the plot.  Unfortunately, it wasn't as entertaining and the ""collateral damage"" of the innocent victims body count is rather sobering and depressing. Butler/Banning fans will want this third movie to line their bookshelves along with the first two for a complete set but don't expect the movie to be as strong as the others.",KLD_Doc3_AngelHasFallen,KLD,Action,Negative,Angel Has Fallen
63,KLD_Doc4_AngelHasFallen,"Ever heard of the phrase  a glutton for punishment ? Of course you have. But just in case, Oxford defines it as  a person who is always eager to undertake hard or unpleasant tasks . Tasks like, I don t know, watching Gerard Butler movies? By that definition I m a walking example of  a glutton for punishment . I really can t blame anyone but myself. It s not like Butler doesn t have a pretty telling track record. But I have this twisted fascination with his movie career which is marked by a bevy of stinkers and the extremely rare gem. And in case you re wondering if his latest  Angel Has Fallen  is one of the gems I wouldn t go that far. This is the third film in Butler s Has Fallen series (for lack of a better title). It sees him reprising his role of Secret Service Superman Mike Banning. To be honest I had fun with the first film  Olympus Has Fallen . It was a silly, fun throwback to the meat-headed action movies of the early 90 s.  London Has Fallen  failed miserably at capturing what made the first film entertaining.  Angel  falls somewhere in the middle. Stuntman turned director Ric Roman Waugh helms this sequel that essentially follows the same blueprint as the previous films. Mike Banning is recommended by President Alan Trumball (Morgan Freeman) to replace the retiring Secret Service Director (played by the always fun Lance Reddick). But as the series has shown us, the job can take a pretty big toll and Banning s body and psyche is letting him know it. Hilariously this seemingly important story-thread vanishes once the action kicks in. While out on a country fishing trip, an assassination attempt is carried out with a swarm of high-tech drones. Banning barely saves the President s life but everyone else including his Secret Service team are killed. The two lone survivors are taken back to Washington where the President is comatose and Banning finds himself framed for the attack. It doesn t take much investigating before a tunnel-visioned FBI Agent Thompson (Jada Pinkett Smith) puts Banning under arrest. So much for all of that  service to his country  bull. Of course like any good Gerry Butler movie, Mike doesn t take it sitting down. He breaks out of custody and sets out to find who framed him and who wants the President dead. He has to seek the help of the last person he wants to see   his father Clay (Nick Nolte), a wooly, off-the-grid mountain hermit who (as you can probably guess) ran out on his family when Mike was a child. That is clearly the go-to offense for scorned fathers in movies. Nolte s character adds a little levity but there is little new or fresh about him beyond that. As you should expect,  Angel Has Fallen  leans heavily on its action. Some of it is fairly exciting and well shot. Other times it can be pretty generic, even frustrating especially when the scene-killing shaky-cam kicks in. And it s all built around a paper-thin plot full of logic-defying silliness and ridiculous conveniences that are just there to get the story from Point A to Point B. By the way, am I the only one who wants to scream when a character won t say the most obvious and necessary thing simply because a storyline hinges on their silence? So basically this is another film worthy of being in Gerry Butler s filmography. But feeling like a silver-lining kind of guy, I will say this is a step up from most of Butler s recent efforts. Nolte earns a few chuckles, I really liked Danny Huston as one of Banning s old military buddies, and the action can sometimes muster up some thrills. But that s about all. Silly plot contrivances and head-scratching character decisions end up standing out more than the action. And for a movie like this, that s not a good thing.",KLD_Doc4_AngelHasFallen,KLD,Action,Negative,Angel Has Fallen
64,KLD_Doc5_AngelHasFallen,"And here is part three of the  Fallen  trilogy, featuring the exploits of Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) who, in 2013 s Olympus has Fallen, saved the American President after a brutal and destructive terrorist assault on the White House. He saved the President yet again after a brutal and destructive terrorist assault on London in 2016 s cleverly-titled London Has Fallen. The angel in the title is Banning himself who, being the only survivor of this umpteenth assassination attempt, is accused of having plotted the assassination himself (notwithstanding the actual saving of the President s life). He escapes arrest and finds himself on the run from the Secret Service, the FBI, and the bad guys themselves who want to make sure he really takes the fall and they can get away with their nefarious plans. While Olympus did the job, delivering an enjoyable if routine action film, London was repetitive and humdrum. It is not long into Angel that it becomes abundantly clear that it is, in fact, standards that have fallen, and the people behind the franchise have simply run out of ideas. Even the most diehard fan of films of this ilk will likely find little to enjoy here. Like its predecessors, the characters are thinly sketched; the plotline is uninspiring, not to say obvious. It is chock-full of violent action scenes, a tone-deaf celebration of American machismo, as Banning bashes and beats his way out of every ludicrous predicament he finds himself in. From the opening scenes, which find Banning in the middle of army boot camp, to the never-ending rooftop-set finale, via his improbable escape from chains, handcuffs and a heavily armed escort, it is dull, it is rote and it is a regurgitation of set-pieces we have seen too often before in much better films. There is little suspense   you know who the bad guy is pretty much from the moment he appears on screen. In trying to make things topical, the underlying plot has a tenuous connection to  Russia , which is not only a tedious throwback to the jingoistic action films of the 1980s but a prime example of the lazy writing and execution that permeates throughout. Butler has had three films in which to develop the character but Banning remains nothing more than a cypher. He grunts and grimaces his way through the role, proffering little nuance or depth, resulting in a cold, unemotional and completely unengaging performance. This time round he is presented as suffering the debilitating effects of the stresses of the job while staring old age and retirement in the face   so a visit to a scolding doctor and various shots of him downing pills are supposed to paint picture of a man in physical and mental pain. And yet any semblance of credibility is smothered by his superhuman ability to fight his way out of any situation. At no point is any attempt made to get under his skin. The American Secret Service is made up of men and women who would step in front of a bullet to save their charges and it would have jacked up the interest considerably had any attempt ever been made to address this. The other characters fare just as badly. Pretty much every member of the not inconsiderable ensemble made up of Morgan Freeman, Danny Huston, Lance Reddick, Tim Blake Nelson, Jada Pinkett Smith and Piper Perabo are simply going through the motions, the latter two grappling with woefully underwritten roles. At least Freeman s character has had some sort of arc over the three films   going from Speaker of the House, to Vice-President, to the President here; and the actor always manages to bring gravitas to proceedings, merely by his presence. Otherwise, it is only Nick Nolte, as Banning s gruff and grubby estranged father, who registers and makes the film a tad bearable. Pity his scenes are few and far between.",KLD_Doc5_AngelHasFallen,KLD,Action,Negative,Angel Has Fallen
65,KLD_Doc6_AngelHasFallen,"American movie presidents can only make us wistful nowadays, and in Angel Has Fallen the White House is graced by Morgan Freeman himself, as President Allan Trumbull. Yes there is a god, probably also played by Morgan Freeman. Trumbull has been promoted since London Has Fallen, Mike Banning s last outing, when taking on hundreds of terrorists across our capital s tourist attractions led to our favourite Secret Service agent becoming incredibly thirsty. Banning too is up for promotion this time around, to Head of the Secret Service, now the current incumbent, David Gentry (Lance Reddick) is retiring. The plot for Angel Has Fallen is signalled a mile off. It s so obvious who the bad guy is and who s in league with him I started to think I was the one being played. There s also some really useful exposition by telephone call, in case you still aren t sure, but it never detracted from my enjoyment. This is a terrific ride that careers through action movie tropes with little concern for the intricacies of a decent plot, but with a surprising sensitivity when it comes to father-son relationships. The third movie in an action franchise is the perfect point to bring on the introspection. We all know the main characters but you can t really go on blowing up huge numbers of people for the same old reasons. No, by number 3 you want to be blowing up huge numbers of people for slightly different reasons. For an anti-war film, a hell of a lot of people die: blown up, droned, blown up, burned to a crisp, stabbed, blown up, and shot. But at least this time we ve moved away from the evil Middle Eastern terrorists trope   yes, to the delight of those like me who grew up during the Cold War, we re back to evil Russians. Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) is tired and damaged, even at the start. He s a wounded bear, self-medicating with painkillers, unable to sleep, concussion leaving him feeling like he s underwater (cue lots of lingering shots of him looking knackered). Until the fighting starts, which perks him up no end. His wife wants him home more, his baby daughter is growing up fast, but while waiting for news of his possible new job he still takes in a full-on combat training course at a facility owned by his old Forces buddy Wade Jennings (Danny Huston). Jennings is now a military contractor, a bad sector to be in since Blackwater. Especially as in the White House, Trumbull is determined to move the Administration away from soldiers for hire fighting America s wars, and indeed from war itself. Soon after, a Presidential fishing trip suffers a drone attack, leaving Trumbull in a coma and Banning the only survivor out of nearly 20 secret service personnel. Before Banning even wakes up in hospital the FBI have found a load of supposedly incriminating information about him. When he comes round, Banning is handcuffed to the bed   less guardian angel and more manacled mutineer. He s also the no.1 suspect for murder and attempted murder. Who has set Mike up: Gentry? Vice President Kirby? Wade Jennings? Ethan Hunt? James Bond? Jason Bourne? (Just kidding.) Does Banning escape? Yes! And pursued by FBI Agent Thompson (Jada Pinkett Smith), he goes off to clear his name and stop the President being finished off for good   which means visiting his old dad Clay in the West Virginian woods. Clay (a fabulous Nick Nolte) left Mike and his mum after witnessing the horror of the Vietnam War. He s now a man who loves the simple life, except when it comes to CCTV and booby-traps, of which he has loads ( one step down from the Unabomber  his son calls him). Angel Has Fallen does try to focus on war and the repercussions for its young fighters, even years down the line; struggles that also tie in to Banning s own damaged body and psyche. Though welcome forays into that area are balanced out by traditionally clunky dialogue ( President Trumbull s top guardian angel has fallen tonight!  says a newscaster). John Wick this isn t. Wick got to clatter through Manhattan on a horse, Mike Banning steals an articulated lorry. Wick is pursued by every black-clad assassin in the world, Banning is surprised by two mountain militia men in check shirts at a petrol station. Parabellum has a scene where John Wick s real name turns out to be Jardani Jovanovich, Angel has one where Mike Banning s name turns out to be   I kid you not   Michael Banning. But within the confines of big budget, straight-up action moviemaking, Angel Has Fallen is cracking fun. There s just enough earnestness about war to make us feel less bad about seeing so many people killed to prevent it, but not so much that we come out feeling we ve been lectured at a CND rally. It never flags until the not-quite final showdown, which goes on way too long. Though the final fight, while entirely expected, is well done; I liked its weariness (and, yes, its inevitability). Piper Perabo as Mike s wife Leah has little to do beyond looking after an unbearably cute toddler. Jada Pinkett Smith doesn t get to do much either, apart from chase Banning round the country via a series of very obvious clues, then wonder if she s made a big mistake. She s always great but she deserves more. And do you remember how 2017 was the year of John Denver s Take Me Home, Country Roads in movies   from Kingsman: The Golden Circle to Logan Lucky to Alien Covenant? Well in Angel Has Fallen they re constantly running around the woods of West Virginia, and the song doesn t pop up once. I d have asked for a refund if I hadn t been enjoying myself so much. Despite the fun there aren t many actual jokes, though neither is it weighed down by its own ponderousness. Still, I like to think Banning s constant need to be fully hydrated is a sly reminder of his fabulous and plot-pointless line from London Has Fallen; and at one point they rather brilliantly CGI Trumbull into the real G7 Summit photocall (I bet when the other world leaders see it they ll be wishing it were true).",KLD_Doc6_AngelHasFallen,KLD,Action,Positive,Angel Has Fallen
66,KLD_Doc7_AngelHasFallen,"It wouldn t take much for  Angel Has Fallen  to become the best installment in a most unlikely franchise. The adventures of Mike Banning, powerhouse Secret Service agent, began in 2013 s  Olympus Has Fallen,  and continued with 2016 s  London Has Fallen,  with the pictures primarily out to create a cartoon realm for the heroic character, keeping him battered but never broken, always ready for a rah-rah-America pose to light up the crowds. The series has found its audience, but anything resembling a creative achievement has been missing.  Angel Has Fallen  isn t a complete break from the  Fallen  formula, but the writing isn t obsessed with jaw-pumping acts of aggression, preferring, for the first time, to treat Mike as a human being between scenes of bodily harm. There s something more interesting going on in the movie, which provides a decent adrenaline shot of action while still managing some tender areas of fragility. Mike (Gerard Butler) is getting older, and past acts of heroism have caught up with him, leaving him concussed, electing to gobble pain pills to keep himself steady. Trying to support his wife, Leah (Piper Perabo), and their young daughter, Mike remains by the side of President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman), who s about to offer his top agent a job as head of the Secret Service. While on vacation, Trumbull is attacked by explosive drones, killing everyone except for the President and Mike, who wakes up in a hospital, under arrest for an assassination attempt funded by the Russians. Confused, Mike realizes he s being framed, soon escaping custody and setting out to clear his name. Offering connections are Mike s military pal, Wade (Danny Huston), and his father, Clay (Nick Nolte), who abandoned his son as a child. With Vice President Kirby (Time Blake Nelson) assuming power, ready to declare war on Russia, Mike has limited time to find the real culprits and save Trumbull, who remains in a coma, protected in a hospital.  Olympus Has Fallen  was basically a remake of  Die Hard,  turning Mike into John McClane, keeping him cocky and merciless when it came to dispatching bad guys. Such bravado remained in  London Has Fallen,  but  Angel Has Fallen  finds Mike as McClane in  Die Hard with a Vengeance,  showing some serious wear and tear as his brain is being turned into jelly after surviving numerous violent events. He s prone to dizzy spells and buying pills from sketchy doctors, trying to keep himself steady for the job, refusing to expose weakness while on the verge of a possible promotion. Butler takes to the new character direction with palpable enthusiasm, permitted to play a person for the first time in the series, dropping the action figure act to communicate Mike s pain and fear as he tries to keep his secrets out of view. There s also a change in tone with  Angel Has Fallen,  finding Mike on the run as he s targeted by an unknown antagonist who uses media manipulation to turn the hero into a villain, allowing the script to create some  Fugitive -esque escape sequences. Co-writer/director Ric Roman Waugh ( Snitch,   Shot Caller ) is a former stunt performer, and he brings some raw energy to  Angel Has Fallen.  While he s not the best at establishing spatial relationships, and camerawork is bit too chaotic at times, he does well flinging bodies everywhere, and the man loves pyro, delivering huge explosions during the initial drone attack and later in the film, when Clay, who lives off the grid in the mountains, showcases some of his own explosive expertise. The feature is packed with chases and shoot-outs, tracking Mike as he encounters average gun-totin  joes trying to catch a crook, local law enforcement, and enemy goons, all the while being pursued by F.B.I. agents, including Helen (Jada Pinkett Smith).  Angel Has Fallen  tries to stay ragged and at least somewhat real, with Waugh striving to keep as much cartoon out of the movie as possible, but that s a war he doesn t fully win. Characters are more important to the production, finding Mike in distress but struggling to maintain composure, while Freeman brings necessary concern to his presidential turn, making Turnbull genuinely fearful for the lives of his men. The best addition to  Angel Has Fallen  is Clay, a fried Vietnam War veteran who doesn t trust the government and melts some when he realizes what he s lost by leaving Mike as a kid. In the middle of an actioner, it s somewhat shocking to come across scenes of regret and political condemnation, and Nolte is perfect for the part. Nobody s getting Oscars for this, but  Angel Has Fallen  features the sharpest performances in the franchise, finally showing interest in personal fallibility and expendability.  Angel Has Fallen  gets carried away in the grand finale, as Waugh is going for explosive bigness and western touches, giving Mike the cowboy a mano to mano showdown. The picture isn t packing major surprises, but it does have an eagerness to please, going overboard for the conclusion. It s too much for an unnecessarily long film, but it s hard to argue with Waugh s fresh direction for the saga, managing to unearth some power in a mostly flaccid franchise, finally getting the mix of vulnerability and brutality right for what may be Mike s final shot at saving the day.",KLD_Doc7_AngelHasFallen,KLD,Action,Positive,Angel Has Fallen
67,KLD_Doc8_AngelHasFallen,"Angel Has Fallen is what used to be called a B movie, but it delivers the goods briskly and has some resonance for grownup viewers, despite an over-the-top plot with few surprises and a director who started as a stuntman   this is the film Brad Pitt's Once Upon a Time   in Hollywood character might have made if he got an auteur break. As in the previous two films in the series, Olympus Has Fallen and London Has Fallen, Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler, who turns 50 in November) guards the president (Morgan Freeman, 82, who seems amused to be playing a president yet again) against assassins, who stage a spectacular attack by a flock of killer drones with face-recognition software. Eighteen Secret Service agents die, but (no spoiler) Banning saves the president, who unfortunately is in a coma and can't tell anyone who saved him. So the vice president (Tim Blake Nelson, 55) and the FBI agent on the case (Jada Pinkett Smith) find it suspicious that the drones recognized and spared Banning's face. And we find it suspicious that Danny Huston, 57, plays Banning's best old war buddy Jennings. Huston is more typecast as a bad guy than Freeman is as a president, and his sinister circumflex eyebrows echo his father John Huston as the ultimate baddie in Chinatown. But it's easy to relate when Jennings and Banning talk about feeling their age and resisting the pressure to retire, or to take a desk job that amounts to the same thing.  We are lions!  Jennings says. ""If I had my way, I would keep hard-charging till the day I die,  replies Banning. Meanwhile, he's tormented by aches, pains, 15 pounds of belly fat that won't go away, concussions, migraines, and a painkiller dependency he won't confess to his wife (Piper Perabo) or the president, and his face looks like a steak somebody beat with a meat tenderizer. He nonetheless rises to the occasion, ingeniously and athletically eluding the FBI manhunt and best pal Jennings  scheme to frame and kill him and the president. (Again, this is no spoiler: The Jennings betrayal comes early; another baddie serves as the third-act reveal.) The action intensifies when Banning flees to Kentucky to hide out with his Vietnam vet dad (Nick Nolte, 78), a paranoid survivalist like a less psychotic Unabomber who's booby-trapped his rural redoubt (much like the booby-trapped woods in Nolte's first great movie, 1978's Who'll Stop the Rain). Nolte's grizzled, long-AWOL dad has a merry, irascible determination, and the movie comes alive when he tussles emotionally with his son Banning and fireworks fill the air with stuntmen. Beneath the B-movie mechanics and genially over-the-top dialogue, there are grownup hearts beating in Angel Has Fallen. Butler and Nolte make you buy their mutually exasperated reconciliation. Compared to the generic characters of Nelson and Smith, they're deep, and the talented Huston really sells his buddy scenes with Banning and his ruthlessly scheming betrayal scenes, too. Though it has a few ominous topical themes thrown in (menacing tech, Russian plots to subvert America, scheming war profiteers, citizen militia bounty hunters), Angel Has Fallen doesn't really have a serious thought in its head. But it's fun, and whatever you do, don't miss the Nolte-Butler scene midway through the credits at the end. It's a comic keeper.",KLD_Doc8_AngelHasFallen,KLD,Action,Positive,Angel Has Fallen
68,KLD_Doc9_AngelHasFallen,"Though some critics have given the  Fallen  movie series a bit of a hard time, I don t see what they re seeing. I love these films. I love the action, I love the bombs, I love the armor-piercing bullets that fly at a dizzying pace. And I love Secret Service agent Mike Manning. I also love Morgan Freeman as President Allan Trumbull. Of course, you can call him President Trumbull all you want, but to me, it was President Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors ever, and in my view, he rarely does me wrong. In the movie, Mike Banning is a Secret Service agent who has been such an exemplary agent in the Secret Service he works the coveted slot of guarding the president. He is the President's 'Guardian Angel' thus, the title of the film. Manning is also the go-to guy sought to train the elite which is showcased at the start of the film. Shortly after the film begins, Banning is offered the potential job of any Secret Service agent's lifetime, The president offers him a job as director of the agency. Because Banning is a field agent through and through, with his own life's issues, he struggles to come to terms with working behind a desk, and hesitates in accepting the position. he is a combat soldier, a roaming lion, so to speak. Enter, the attack drones that explode on impact during a heavily guarded presidential fishing trip. Everything goes south, after an explosion-filled morning, Banning becomes the victim of a setup and the world believes he is the man solely responsible for trying to assassinate the president. It is the world against Secret Service agent Banning, who wastes no time in fighting to stay alive and on the run in an attempt to prove his innocence. Alone, half blown-up and exhausted, he seeks to find his long-lost father, that had previously abandoned the family due to his own combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder. A bit clich  you might say? Absolutely. Forgivable to have such a clich ? Absolutely. Because the film doesn't stop delivering beautifully orchestrated chaos. Nick Nolte is hilarious as Banning s long-lost dad, and I did not expect for this movie to have so much humor, but it was an excellent bit of refreshment in between bombs going off, trucks crashing into police cars, and the seriousness of the FBI seeking to find a presidential assassinate. With a bit of forethought, I m certain something a bit out of the realm of being a clich  could have been created, but why? The  Fallen  movies which include Olympus Has Fallen (2013) and London Has Fallen (2016) are Great in their ability to deliver action, they deliver films filled with conflict, lots of bullets, different types of weaponry, grenades, helicopters, fighter jets and more which all come together to create exactly what I love in these type of movies. Gerard Butler, who portrays Secret Service agent Mike Banning, is excellent. When he refers to his military past in the film, as a former US Army Lieutenant, I buy it a hundred percent. So much that I wonder if he was former military. As I said, Morgan Freeman is my favorite, and Nick Nolte who plays Banning s father continues to deliver one smart ass comment after another in hilarious fashion. I loved his character and loved every interaction with him and others in the film. I wasn t alone in my appreciation, my laughter was never alone, I was always joined by countless others in the theater who thought it was just as funny as I did. There were a few nice surprises in this film as well, I truly appreciated Jada Pinkett Smith s Portrayal as FBI Agent Helen Thompson, who admittedly came across as a real jerk, but the exact type of jerk you would expect her to be in her position with the FBI. I also really enjoyed Danny Huston as the antagonist Wade Jennings from the Salient Agency. Huston, in my view, does an excellent job as any sort of  evil villian  or antihero in the films he has played. There were a few twists and turns I didn t expect and I appreciated being thrown a curveball. I wasn t surprised when the proverbial  mystery person behind the computer voice  was revealed. But I am pretty good at making guesses at a film s plot. So in conclusion, I highly recommend this film if you enjoy hard action, bodies flying through the air due to explosions, armor-piercing rounds throwing people all over the place and buildings exploding with hundreds of people running for their lives. It s a great action film and worthy of the price of admission definitely check it out. I give this film an 8.5 out of 10 for great action, great humor that was unexpected, and a nice hearty and satisfying conclusion. And since I am now officially certified film and movie critic on Rotten Tomatoes I officially give this film a  Certified Fresh  rating.",KLD_Doc9_AngelHasFallen,KLD,Action,Positive,Angel Has Fallen
69,KLD_Doc10_AngelHasFallen,"Director and co-writer Ric Roman Waugh not only electrifies the already exhilarating  Fallen  franchise with ANGEL HAS FALLEN, almost doubling the amount of action set pieces as that seen in  London Has Fallen  while taking them to new heightened extremes, but takes it to new levels of storytelling that go beyond explosions, action, and Gerard Butler eye candy. Waugh, together with co-writers Robert Mark Kamen and Matt Cook, brings us a depth of story and character not previously seen in this franchise, and rarely seen in high octane action films. The result is mind-blowing, thought-provoking, edge-of-your-seat entertainment. And then Nick Nolte is added to the mix! Mike Banning is back. Nursing his wounds after saving the White House, London, and the President in the last two  Fallen  installments, he is now a father to little Lynn and serving as Secret Service guardian angel to now-President Trumbull. Wife Leah is pushing Banning to step back from active duty and accept a hoped for offer to become Secret Service Director aka a desk jockey. But Banning isn t quite ready to take a back seat to history just yet as we start to see just how much of a toll the past eight or more years have indeed taken on him. His C2-5 spinal area is severely compromised, as are his shoulders and knees; he suffers with migraines, insomnia, and nightmares; symptoms of PTSD are becoming visible, at least to Trumbull; and he s living on pain pills to get through the day. But Banning won t stop. It s not in his DNA to stand down. When we meet up with Banning again this go-round, he s deep in active ops. He s his usual one-man killing machine. Only unlike his prior high profile activities, he loses the battle here. As we quickly see, however, luckily these hard-charging ops are only a training exercise or Banning would be dead. And that s something we aren t used to seeing. The one good thing to come out of this training though is that Banning gets to reconnect with his old military buddy Wade Jennings who owns and runs this facility and is looking to get set up with some private government mercenary contracts. Each man, lions both, has the life they dreamt of. Life is good. Or is it? Heading back to D.C. and then out with Trumbull for a winter weekend escape from politics and to get in some time fishing on the lake, Banning is having some noticeable problems with dizziness. Trumbull tells Banning to head to shore. Rest. Send a relief agent out to guard him. After all, what s going to happen in the middle of a lake. You know the old adage, anything that can go wrong will go wrong? Everything goes wrong here as a drone bombing strike swarms the lake and surrounding area, killing every agent but for one, Mike Banning. An assassination attempt on the President, it s only thanks to Banning s quick thinking and action that Trumbull is alive, albeit in a coma. But because Banning is the only agent alive and evidence at the scene and surrounding areas point directly to Banning as being the perpetrator, he becomes the FBI s number one suspect in the crime. Intent on clearing his name, the hunter becomes the hunted as Banning determines to not only find the people responsible for these acts but the reason behind them. And as all lions know, when being hunted, it s best to stay downwind and out of sight. To do that, Mike Banning knows there s only one place for him to go. To Clay Banning. For the first time in his directorial career, Ric Roman Waugh has come into an established franchise, but makes it his, putting his signature stamp on it. Compromising nothing when it comes to the action in ANGEL HAS FALLEN, what elevates the film lies behind the action   an incredible story with powerful emotions.  ANGEL HAS FALLEN has all the gravitas of Waugh s prior works,  Felon ,  Shot Caller , and the truth and reality of the acclaimed documentary  That Which I Love Destroys Me  which looks at PTSD of returning soldiers in today s technologically advanced world of warfare. The emotional intensity of this story in its character study exploration of Mike Banning takes the franchise and AHF to a new level. The first two films in the franchise were driven by action and Gerard Butler eye candy (Thank you VERY much!). But now we get to understand who Mike Banning is, what makes him tick, what drives him. Being an agent isn t just a job to Banning. It s a calling. But why? This story digs deep into Mike Banning and thanks to an emotionally layered performance from Butler, strong script, and equally strong emotionally driven lensing, we feel, we empathize, and we also ask questions thanks to tactfully developed ambiguity and metaphor. The story construct and structure is well done. Rooted in reality. Realistically shaped. Our socio-political climate is keenly incorporated into the mix as a resonant driving force for the plot. AHF speaks to the ties that bind, be it blood relations, military brotherhood, politics, power, money and greed, loss. But the most interesting aspect of AHF is the introspection of Banning and then tossing in the introduction to his dad, Clay. The past two films Mike has been an indestructible robot, almost a machine. But now, we see cracks in the veneer. We see self-worry and self-questioning. And THIS is what sets AHF apart from the franchise. It fascinates as this rock of a man shows vulnerability. It s relatable.  Humanizing.  Palpable.  And Butler brings that to the forefront in spades while cinematographer Jules O Laughlin and his crew capture it all up close and personal. But we don t just see the cracks. Butler, Waugh, and company explore them. Already a fan of O Laughlin s work thanks to  The Hitman s Bodyguard  and what he did with framing and lighting, with AHF he takes that to the next level, here meeting the challenge of establishing a visually tangible internalized character exploration with extreme extreme close-ups, and then turning the tables with beautiful bright, light metaphor as emotional complexities are laid bare. The careful eye will note that the ECU s are reserved for the characters of Banning and Trumbull. Camera dutching raises red flags on multiple levels, casting doubt on accusations against Banning while casting aspersions on a multiplicity of other individuals. Is there a mole in the Secret Service? The FBI? A traitor? Notable is how the camera emotionally plays with Jada Pinkett Smith s FBI Agent Johnson and others in the  inner circle of trust.  A real standout with the cinematic canvas is the work of Second Unit Director Vic Armstrong. A legend in the stunt and action world as both a stuntman (stunt double for Harrison Ford and Roger Moore) and director, here, Armstrong and Waugh essentially run two units simultaneously to capture from multiple angles some of the most insane action on screen today. A lot of handheld and steadi-cam work with the action immerses the audience in the moment.  Serving as stunt coordinator is Greg Powell whose fight choreography and man-on-man stunt work is exemplary. We first saw this pulled off by Waugh with Dwayne Johnson in  Snitch  and now we see it again in the hands of Gerard Butler and Vic Armstrong   a high speed modified  grasshopper  stunt with an 18-wheeler doing a partial rollover/semi-jump on a bridge. Only this time, it s shot at night, in a forest, on a single lane road and bridge, with no lights but for those adorning the edges of the 18-wheeler, headlights, and an occasional chopper beam. An edge of your seat thrill that speaks volumes as to what s at stake for Banning! And folks   this is not CGI. But how about fireball explosions in what has been coined by the cast and crew as  Napalm Alley ? Waugh tops  Apocalypse Now  for the number and size of these explosions. Again, done practically. The body count is also astronomical. Kudos to production designer Russell DiRozario who dazzles us with his work in designing Clay s cabin and underground tunnels. The detail within this  self-sustaining  analog cabin is telling of Clay s past and his understanding while concurrently speaking to that of Mike and the dynamic between the two men. Always wanting authenticity at the forefront of every story and film, Waugh left no stone unturned when it comes to AHF, calling on friends in the Secret Service as well as those involved in the cutting-edge swarm drone technology. This isn t science-fiction or something  in the future . What we see onscreen is the here and now. Gabriel Fleming s editing is tight. Pacing keeps moving   and not just from the action   but from the emotional turmoil within Mike. . .and then the humor from Clay! Once Clay enters the fray we have some respites of humor that are beyond delicious and while Fleming s comedic timing with the edits is exemplary, it s Nick Nolte who sells each line, look, and moment. Going beyond Gerard Butler and Morgan Freeman, who appear on screen together in the same scenes for the first time in the franchise, casting is exemplary starting with Danny Huston as Wade Jennings and moving into Tim Blake Nelson as VP Kirby and beyond. Jada Pinkett Smith walks a double-edged sword as we aren t quite sure which side of the street she s truly walking. Similarly, Lance Reddick; while we know which side of the fence Gentry is on in terms of dedication to the job, we re not sure where his heart or his mind lies. The performances all strike a wonderful tone of ambiguity. And of course, Nolte just soars.  He and Butler together are liquid gold, feeding and fueling each other.  As of this moment, for my money, he s in the running for Best Supporting Oscar nods. Another fresh take on the franchise comes in terms of the score courtesy of David Buckley. A total departure from the first two films, Buckley delivers a score filled with dramatic weight and gravitas versus well known anticipatory high-octane action notes. At the end of the day, ANGEL HAS FALLEN comes down to exhilaration and excitement, emotion and empathy. Internal emotion and what makes a man tick, no matter what side of the fence he s on. Empathy in understanding that man beyond the surface. And as for exhilaration and excitement? It s Gerard Butler. It s Mike Banning. It s a Ric Roman Waugh film.

10,CKM_Doc1_Inception,"Following the blowout box office success of 2008 s The Dark Knight (which grossed $535.2 million domestically and $1.1 billion worldwide) and the rampant raves it received (culminating in a posthumous Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Heath Ledger), Christopher Nolan was finally rightfully recognized as the adept auteur he had always been, gaining commendation from crowds and critics across the globe. Though Nolan was no freshman filmmaker   having made several acclaimed indies from 1998-2002 (Following, Memento, Insomnia) and beginning his blockbuster blitz with 2005 s Batman Begins   The Dark Knight turned him into a national name, with Sue Kroll, president of Warner Bros.  worldwide marketing, even stating that  Christopher Nolan [was now] a brand.  While the world waited with bated breath for Nolan s conclusion to his brilliant Batman trilogy, he had another project in mind he wanted to pursue before going back to Gotham City. Nolan initially pitched the idea for the intricate and inventive Inception to Warner Bros. back in 2001, but he wished to acquire more awareness on how to best bring  larger-scale  films to life before officially tackling this twisty tale; with two big-budget Batman flicks under his belt, the time had come to make his delirious dreams a reality (both literally and figuratively) and begin constructing his most complex chronicle yet. We have a little less than a month to wait until Nolan s eleventh feature film, Tenet, hits theaters (scheduled for Wednesday, August 12th), but to coincide with both that picture s first release date and Inception s 10th anniversary, the seventh edition of  Flashback Films  is dedicated to revisiting Nolan s ballsy 2010 blockbuster and investigating its influence on innovation in cinema over the past decade. Given that Tenet is seemingly quite similar to Inception in scale, scope, and story, there s no better way to put your anticipation for Nolan s latest effort at ease than by joining us to analyze one of his greatest achievements. Originally envisioned as a horror-tinged heist film about  dream stealers,  Nolan soon realized that Inception s plot lacked  personal  stakes and emotional investment; in a movie centered around memories and the mind, this was an obvious oversight. For the next nine to ten years, Nolan strained to smooth out his script, soon settling on a story that told of a  dream thief  named Cobb (to be played by the legendary Leonardo DiCaprio) who was called upon by a client to assemble a crew (composed of actors such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy) that could pull off the converse chore of instead planting an idea in an influential C.E.O. s subconscious   this procedure would come to be known as  inception.  Just as Inception s narrative follows its protagonists  twisty travels through  dreams within dreams within dreams,  Nolan additionally fine-tuned the film to jump from genre to genre to genre throughout its running time. When analyzed from afar, one can see that Inception has the suspenseful set-up of a heist film, the stupefying stunt work of an action adventure (most notably in that instantly iconic skirmish set in a  rotating hallway ), and the stirring subject matter of a science-fiction fable. After collecting compelling characteristics from each specific style of cinema, Nolan composed an entirely original creation that came to stand on its own as a cutting-edge concept. With such a mastery of the medium, Nolan managed to acquire the attention of his audience through the use of these familiar filmic frameworks right before pulling the rug out from beneath them with his more imaginative intentions to investigate our innermost identities. Now, naturally, with the film s aspirational ambitions, one would expect an extensive amount of exposition in Inception (especially given the tradition of  leaders  spelling out schemes to their  squads  at the start of heist movies, many of which Inception borrows heavily from), but Nolan doesn t actually stop describing the rules of his  dreamworld  until he s halfway through the film s third act. Such a dicey decision runs the risk of alienating audiences who feel flustered by the epic s elaborateness early on, but somehow, Nolan defied the odds and delivered a script with complex and captivating dialogue that never loses its coherence. Nolan received an Academy Award nomination for his screenwriting, and rightfully so; to make these thought-provoking themes and perplexing plot turns sound so simple and yet so stimulating at the same time is a herculean task, and Nolan did so without breaking a sweat. To this day, Inception remains the  gold standard  of enlightening yet enthralling entertainment, and though many have tried, few blockbusters have come close to matching its bold brilliance. Aside from Inception s awe-inspiring action and constant cerebral contemplations about the human consciousness, the film is able to incorporate an impressively touching thematic throughline about Cobb s deceased wife, Mal (played by Marion Cotillard, of La Vie en Rose and Midnight in Paris), who continues to haunt his headspace and put his plans in jeopardy. Not only does Mal s inclusion allow Nolan to fiddle with another film genre (this time it s noir, since she fills in as the famed  femme fatale ), but she also strengthens the soul of the story. Cobb is always grappling with the guilt he still experiences over the role he believes he played in Mal s suicide, and this internal struggle grounds Inception as a whole, providing the film with a sympathetic strife to relate to amidst all the startling spectacle. Cotillard s provocative and persuasive performance only makes Mal all the more mesmerizing, as we find ourselves just as hypnotized by her as Cobb, and we are therefore able to fully engage with his emotions. Ten years later, Inception also still stands as a tremendous technical triumph, utilizing psychedelic special effects, sumptuous sound design, expeditious editing (courtesy of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight s Lee Smith), and Hans Zimmer s spine-tingling score to build a behemoth of a movie that begs to be seen on the big-screen. Nolan has always been a devout defender of the  theatrical experience    and this worship is almost always reflected in his work   but Inception is perhaps his most immersive contribution to cinema to date, with each crew member capitalizing on the fullest capabilities of their craft. It s one thing to envision an epic like Inception, but it s another to actually portray the promise of the film s plot to its fullest potential   and once again, Nolan overcomes the odds. In the wake of Inception s enormous earnings at the box office ($292.6 million domestically and $825.5 million worldwide   the third most successful feature in Nolan s filmography behind The Dark Knight Rises and The Dark Knight), more studios were inclined to bet on similar  big-budget blockbusters with brains  from A-list artists such as Alfonso Cuar n (Gravity) and George Miller (Mad Max: Fury Road). Without Inception paving the way for these pictures at the start of the decade, it s hard to imagine producers feeling fearless enough to entrust these filmmakers with the funds required to fully realize their grandiose goals. Luckily, Nolan assured that audiences would indeed show up in swarms for these thought-provoking tentpoles. Though Inception ends on an infamously inconclusive note (as we are left to wonder if Cobb rejoins the  real world  or remains stuck in his subconscious), one thing is for certain   Inception is a stone cold classic that will most definitely continue to live on in our dreams until the end of time. By forging new frontiers for film and reminding moviegoers of the magic of the medium with this confounding yet consuming creation, Nolan affirmed that The Dark Knight was no fluke, and he asserted himself as an auteur for the ages.",CKM_Doc1_Inception,CKM,Action,Positive,Inception
11,CKM_Doc2_Inception,"After the release of Christopher Nolan s  Inception  back in 2010, I wrote a review on my earlier blog site praising the film. After several more viewings, I would continue to applaud this production and it was easily my favorite film of that year. But as excited as I was over  Inception , I still don t think my previous review did justice to what has become one of my favorite movies of all time. Yes, I said of all time! I still find  Inception  to be one of the most original and most ambitious movies I ve ever seen. But ambition doesn t always equal a great movie.  Inception  not only aims high but it succeeds in creating a brilliant and unique picture that s unlike anything I ve seen. It s hard to pigeonhole  Inception . It s a heist film, a tragic romance, science-fiction, and an action film. But the best thing is it uses all of these ingredients flawlessly. The bulk of its success can be traced right back to Nolan. For my money Christopher Nolan is one of our greatest working directors. He wrote , co-produced, and directed this film and I truly believe he s one of the only visionary filmmakers who could have pulled this off. It took him almost ten years to write and rewrite the script and it took the huge success of  The Dark Knight  to secure the big budget needed to make  Inception . But you sure can t argue with the results of the finished product.  Inception  ended its box office run making over $825 million worldwide. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, an actor Nolan had wanted to work with for some time. He plays  Dom  Cobb, a dream thief for lack of a better title. He, along with his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), are paid to infiltrate the subconsciouses of their targets via their dreams and steal information. When the dream extraction from a wealthy Japanese businessman named Saito (Ken Watanabe) goes wrong, Cobb and Arthur find out they were being tested. Instead of extracting information, Saito wants the them to attempt inception on a business rival of his. The idea of inception is that instead of stealing information you plant it in the target s subconscious while they re dreaming. There are questions as to whether inception is even possible but Cobb is enticed to take the job when Saito promises to use his influence to clear Cobb s name of a mysterious murder charge that has kept him out of the United States and separated from his two children. To do the job Cobb needs a top-notch team of experts. Eames (Tom Hardy) is basically a forger or probably better described as an impersonator. Once inside a dream he has the ability to take on the identity of anyone. Ariadne (Ellen Page) is the architect. She is able to construct mental labyrinths inside the dreamers subconscious. This is essential if the team is going to know their way around the dream. Yusuf (Dileep Rao) is basically the team s pharmacist. He s the one who controls the sleep via his numerous concoctions. Saito also insists on going and keeping an eye on his  investment . Nolan takes us through the formation of the team, bits of their training, and of course their attempt at inception. As the story moves forward Nolan plays with our minds as he begins placing dreams within dreams and he causes his audience to pay close attention as their well planned heist encounters more and more complications.  One thing I ve always loved about a Christopher Nolan film is his ability to put to gather the perfect cast. This may be his best yet. DiCaprio has been a critic s darling with several of his performances, but I think this is one of his very best. Cobb knows his business but he s a tortured man with loads of emotional baggage. Leo handles all of this perfectly. I also loved Tom Hardy here and he steals nearly every scene he s in. Eames is a confident wisecracker and some of his best scenes are when he s giving Arthur a hard time. Speaking of Arthur, Gordon-Levitt gives another strong performance and he has one particular action sequence that s one of the best I ve ever seen. And then there s Ellen Page who I liked as Ariadne. Her character is new to the dream scene and she brings a needed sense of caution and reality to the mission. But there are some other great performances that are important to the story and worth mentioned. One of my favorites was Marion Cotillard as Mal. She has a special bond with Cobb and repeatedly appears within the dreams potentially compromising the mission. Cotillard s performance is multi-layered and fascinating. Michael Caine, a Nolan favorite, is very good as Cobb s father-in-law and caregiver of his children. Cillian Murphy plays the team s central target for inception and he too is a great fit for his role. It was also great to see Tom Berenger given a nice role to work with and the great Peter Postlethwaite in what would be his last performance before his death due to pancreatic cancer. All of these performers are sharply in tune with the material and the cast serves as just one of the movie s many high points. Nolan is also a visual filmmaker and there is some incredibly eye candy in  Inception . The movie was filmed in locations all over the world including Tokyo, Morocco, Paris, and Alberta. Each of these places have their own separate and distinct look and feel to them within the movie whether they take place in reality or in a dream. This was an intentional move by Nolan who wanted to place his film in the contemporary world while also playing with our perceptions of what is real and what s not. And of course since we re talking about dreams, Nolan has a spectacular and diverse visual sandbox to play in. He wows us with several amazing special effects sequences that include rotating hotel rooms, trains barreling down big city boulevards, and a shootout at a fortified arctic base.  Inception  hits you with one spectacular set piece after another and all of this gels nicely with the movie s deep and layered story.  Inception  isn t a movie with a straightforward by-the-books narrative. It s a film that requires you to pay attention and I like that. I ve talked with people who didn t care for the movie because of its complexities and I can t help but be puzzled. So many movies are simple and formulaic genre films that never challenge their audiences in any way. For me it s refreshing to have something completely original and fresh and I appreciate how the film doesn t dumb things down for the audience. I m also amazed at just how well this complex story unwraps. Nolan constantly throws new kinks into his story to the point where I questioned whether he could bring it all together. But like a skilled and crafty pro he pulls everything in during the last 20 minutes, right up to the beautiful final shot. And that final scene, well it gets a little misty for me every single time. For me everything in  Inception  works. The special effects, the action sequences, Nolan s phenomenal script, the incredible cast, Hans Zimmer s pulse pounding score. This is why I go to the movies. There s nothing conventional about  Inception  and there s no way to watch it and not appreciate its craftsmanship. That said be prepared to think. The story is a bit of a challenge but that s just another joy I get from watching it. I understand it may not be everyone s cup of tea but it gives me everything I want in a motion picture experience. For me this is a modern cinematic masterpiece.",CKM_Doc2_Inception,CKM,Action,Positive,Inception
12,CKM_Doc3_Inception,"The scope of Christopher Nolan s on-screen ambition is seemingly limitless, particularly his relentless desire to destroy the accepted standard that a big Hollywood blockbuster is inherently mindless. He already proved his theory with The Dark Knight, and with Inception, he nails it again with his personal mix of cerebral celluloid cement and the mind-blowing action for which he is now equally revered. Forget the hype machine, and the wilfully obscure marketing campaign   quality filmmaking of this calibre, like Nolan s low budget sophomore film Memento with its equally mind-bending structure, can speak for itself. By now, anyone who s been chomping at the bit for any online snippet of information about Inception will have an idea   planted by the media in cahoots, no doubt   of what to expect from the plot, the tagline for which is  Your mind is the scene of the crime . It s a metaphysical thriller, in which Christopher Nolan explores a genuinely audacious idea   no doubt first created in his own enviable dreams   that he could set a film within the mind of sleeping dreamers   and we d buy it. Leonardo diCaprio stars as Dom Cobb, an  extractor , whose expertise is extracting ideas and thoughts from inside the dreams of others has led to his exile from home, and his status as a wanted man for a crime he didn t commit. One last job could save him, but it s not to extract   instead, he has to plant an idea, a far trickier concept. It s a psychologically complex premise, insisting the audience flex their minds as they watch; this is not a film for the lazy. But neither is it too complicated to be wholly enjoyable, as some might label Memento. Nolan uses exposition sparingly, but each character that arrives on the scene explains each step, drawing the audience inextricably into the world of dreams that Nolan has imagined, so convincingly that there is little cause to question his rules   except of course, if such cleverness inspires you to stay alert for logic holes instead of willingly getting just a little bit dazed by the idea that at any one time, you re not entirely sure just which character s subconscious your attention is swimming in. There s humour and heart too, if less than one might want   possibly the weightiest criticism one could muster   with particular kudos going to Tom Hardy s  forger  Eames , a dreamscape impersonator providing much needed light relief from the action and heavy emotional themes of guilt, forgiveness and redemption with his droll patter and sly one liners. Nolan s world in Inception is one that could rival Burgess  Clockwork Orange in originality, with a specific vocabulary and a physics-bending set of rules that normalise an essentially insane idea, that we can wade around inside dreams, moulding them, as Ellen Page s dream architect Ariadne (a not so subtle nod to the Greek figure who guides Theseus out of the labyrinth, essentially her task here) does, initially with innocence.  It s just pure creation  she says in wonderment, before peeling up an entire pavement and pasting it to the sky, then walking on it. But there are consequences to psychic wandering, particularly when enemies from within the dreamer s brains appear with murderous intentions, or those in the know have been brain-trained to defend their subconscious, military style (hence the explosive action) from such psychic invasions. Nolan has no intention of just feeding a concept and expecting that to be enough. It s difficult to imagine a dream within a dream within a dream successfully translating to any art form. But he pulls it off with bells on, on a blizzarding mountainside, held within a zero gravity Spiderman style punch up (from the sombre, wonderfully understated Joseph Gordon Levitt), held within a trance-like bus falling endlessly into a watery abyss. Explaining further would be pointless   this is one epic, multi-layered journey every man must take for himself.  They say we only use a fraction of our brain s potential  we are told in Inception. The same will never be said of Nolan.",CKM_Doc3_Inception,CKM,Action,Positive,Inception
13,CKM_Doc4_Inception,"Mind-blowing doesn t even begin to describe director Christopher Nolan s latest foray into the mystifying realm of the subconscious. Like  Following  and  Memento  before it,  Inception  builds upon several truly clever concepts; but where his previous efforts only alter the timelines and the chronology of the information the audience receives, this film also plays with time itself, expanding and adjusting it to suit the adventure and mystery. Add to that the film s focus on the already enigmatic nature of dreams and their Jungian infiltration, disruption, and manipulation by experts (both in front of and behind the camera) and the movie becomes so stunningly complex and thought-provoking that it practically demands repeat viewing   not because it s too confusing to absorb all the creative ideas the first time around, but because it s just so astonishingly brilliant. When asleep, the mind s defenses diminish, allowing infiltration and deception by those with the ability to navigate the intricacies of the subconscious. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is one such  extractor  whose experiences with dream sharing are both enlightening and tragic. A fugitive from the U.S. for his involvement in corporate espionage and his implication in murder, Cobb is presented with an offer he can t refuse: attempt a seemingly impossible undertaking of  inception  on a rival of energy magnate Saito (Ken Watanabe) in exchange for a chance to return home. But the task of planting an idea in someone s dream rather than stealing it requires intricate planning, forcing Cobb to recruit an  architect,  Ariadne (Ellen Page), a  forger,  Eames (Tom Hardy), a  chemist,  Yusuf (Dileep Rao), and longtime extracting partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) to help execute the complex operation. Once their meticulous mission begins, Cobb s dark past and their target s unexpected awareness threatens to tear apart their carefully fabricated realities. Those that make it out alive may never awaken to the truth. Few films can achieve the level of creativity in  Inception,  a masterwork of complexity, intelligence, and ambition. Dreams have always been an endlessly fascinating subject for movies, a concept that can be explored again and again without ever being repetitive or derivative (if handled correctly). With no rules, the possibilities are immeasurable, limited only by the minds of the designers. Writer/director Christopher Nolan uses this to fashion an unpredictable, intense, unknown, mazy world full of spellbinding visuals and consternating twists. Anything can happen and just about everything does. Although he s renowned for jumpstarting a new Batman series, Nolan is well on his way to being more highly recognized for his mind-numbing psychological thrillers. The film opens with a dream within a dream sequence to demonstrate a notion, to plant a seed of doubt in the viewer s acknowledgement of the unfolding events, and to introduce them to unique characters with a job that warrants plenty of explanation. With theories on extraction (retrieving information from a dream), inception (planting information in a dream), dream-sharing, the subconscious  emotional influence, limbo (dying in a dream), projections (inhabitants of a dream), instability, and suspicion, all presented rapidly, the mysteries and lack of origins outweigh the answers.  Whose subconscious are we going into, exactly?  asks Ariadne, confirming the confusion general audiences might conjure with the plot. Fortunately, despite the half-a-dozen people tapping into a single dream, the impressive fight sequences in Escherian landscapes, the masterfully constructed differences in timeframes for each level of dreaming, and the dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream finale,  Inception  proves to be both largely understandable and entertaining with reasonable concentration. Pay attention   it s definitely worth it.",CKM_Doc4_Inception,CKM,Action,Positive,Inception
14,CKM_Doc5_Inception,"For weeks nay, months I played along with the coy refusals by writer/director Christopher Nolan and the cast members of Inception to reveal too much about its premise. I resisted the urge to watch online trailers; I shunned early reviews; in effect, I spent the entire spring doing everything but literally sticking my fingers in my ears and chanting ""la la la la la."" So, now I'm faced with a philosophical question nearly as thorny as those posed by Nolan in the film itself: How do I approach discussing its conceptual ambition while preserving that sense of discovery? Christopher Nolan is nothing if not a filmmaker who demands that you wrestle with ideas. Now, that doesn't mean bowing down to him as pop-culture's answer to Socrates; he's too gifted a showman to make it all about dissecting his koans. But for a decade, Nolan has built a body of work out of how we define our identity and our reality: the self-created memory of Memento; the existential magic trick at the climax of The Prestige; Batman's surrender to what people need to believe in The Dark Knight. Inception finds him again in that familiar territory and the result is something almost as thrilling to contemplate as it is to watch. Those who prefer their tabulas entirely rasa may want to exit now, because here's the setup: In an unspecified future, the technology exists for people to enter one another's dreams. Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), once a researcher into the technology, has (for initially unclear reasons) become a fugitive, supporting himself as a corporate spy stealing business ideas from the subconscious of executives. But one powerful businessman, Saito (Ken Watanabe), offers Cobb a chance to re-claim his life if he can pull off a harder trick than stealing an idea from the mind of his chief competitor, Fischer (Cillian Murphy): planting one there. It takes most of Inception's first hour to introduce its characters and the complex rules of its mindscape universe, which could have made for a long slog. Nolan proves too crafty to fall into that trap, allowing his exposition to unfold in a purely visual context that allows us to discover what we need to know along with Cobb's newest team member, Ariadne (Ellen Page). The same approach provides the opportunity to unfold Cobb's crucial, tangled back story, including the events that led to his exile and the role of his wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who keeps showing up unbidden during his jobs. Considering how much raw information Nolan needs to unload and how easy it would have been to lose momentum, and the audience, during that time Inception proves remarkably nimble at getting us to the payoff. And what a payoff it is. The trip into Fischer's head that comprises the final hour-plus of Inception involving Cobb and his team members, also including his long-time partner (Joseph Gordon-Leavitt) and a master ""forger"" of other personalities (Tom Hardy) turns into a bravura, jaw-dropping, extended set piece that's astonishing on nearly every possible level. As pure action, it delivers crunching chases, snowmobile pursuits and one gravity-defying fistfight that becomes the final smackdown to every other pretender to the Matrix throne. As imaginative visual showpiece, it gives you a world where stairways bend in Escher-esque directions and a train can come hurtling down a city street. And as an exercise in multilevel storytelling, it should become one for the film-studies textbooks, as Nolan and his editor Lee Smith often find themselves juggling four concurrent cliffhanger plotlines. For more than an hour, Inception maintains a level of breath-holding tension that simply doesn't seem possible. That should be enough for any movie-lover to ask for but Nolan gives us more. The emotional weight he adds to Cobb's tale pushes Inception to another level, one in which questions about the way we shape our reality balance the pure adrenaline excitement. It's not necessary to see Nolan's philosophizing as earth-shaking; it does tread into notions he already explored in Memento, and does so with less potency than the simple gee-whiz moments. But, Nolan continues to succeed at what most big-budget filmmakers never even bother to try: trusting that our cinematic sense of wonder doesn't have to be disconnected from our brains. Even if you now know a little about what Inception is about, you don't even know the half of it.",CKM_Doc5_Inception,CKM,Action,Positive,Inception
15,CKM_Doc6_Inception,"I can't help but wonder. I wonder what kind of audiences are going to show up for writer/director Christopher Nolan's new film, Inception? I wonder if the film, coming on the heels of the mega success of Nolan's The Dark Knight, can come close to that film's stellar box-office numbers. I wonder who will declare Inception to be cinematic greatness and, likewise, I wonder who will declare the film to be nothing but hollow hype. I wonder if I understand the film. Even remotely. I wonder, a lot, about the multi-layered mind of Nolan that could even manifest a film such as Inception. I wonder. In Inception, Dom (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the best of the best in the dangerous art of high stakes extraction, the stealing of ideas from the subconscious during the ultra vulnerable dream state. This high risk, high reward method of corporate espionage has left Dom an international fugitive who has lost virtually everything that means anything to him. There's one last shot at redemption, but it comes at a high cost. Dom must pull of the act of inception, not the stealing of ideas but the planting of them in hopes of pulling off the ultimate crime and, perhaps, receiving the ultimate reward. Inception is, without a doubt, Christopher Nolan's reward film. Easily one of the most bankable filmmakers in Hollywood whose name does not end in Cameron, Christopher Nolan directed The Dark Knight, Hollywood's highest grossing film outside the James Cameron universe. Even before The Dark Knight, Nolan had garnered tremendous respect over the course of such films as Memento, Insomnia, The Prestige and Batman Begins. With an estimated production budget of $200 million rumored, Inception is Nolan's reward for such a fine catalogue of work and, yet, I dare say the film will be hard pressed to capture back its budget unless positive word-of-mouth and the fanboys unite for repeated viewings of the multi-layered, otherly atmospheric film. Let's be honest. The trailer for Inception is itself confusing, not exactly an invitation for the typically spoon-fed American audience and it doesn't exactly draw you into the story. Truth be told, I'm not sure a movie trailer even could do the trick. Inception has different layers, floors and universes all semi-neatly wrapped around by a rather fundamental sci-fi/crime thriller. Inception won't draw you in with its compelling story or sympathetic storylines, though certainly Dom's grief becomes a key player as to how the action unfolds. The emotional experience is secondary in Inception, a stimulant for the intellect and for the senses in the way that subconscious and imagery collides throughout the film. As I began writing this review, I found myself reflecting upon the Robin Williams film What Dreams May Come, a film that attempted but largely failed to create a sense of an other world. More recently, Peter Jackson attempted to blend humanity and heaven in The Lovely Bones with decidedly mixed results. While you may not embrace Inception, and not embracing it would be fully understandable, it is nearly impossible to deny that Nolan has succeeded in creating layers upon layers of another world that exists in the subconscious, the conscious and everything in between and beyond. Whereas James Cameron's Avatar magnificently utilized 3-D imagery to previously unseen heights, I'd dare say that Inception transcends Avatar by Nolan's ability to utilize technology to create a world unlike anything you've ever seen unfold on the big screen. Nolan could likely script a Pixar film, because Nolan refuses to dumb down or simply his films. Is this conceit or respect? At different moments, both points could be arguable. It does, however, add pressure to Nolan as filmmaker because it requires him to write, direct and film with crystal clarity and sense of purpose. Without the usual 1/3 of the film devoted to fundamental exposition, Nolan immediately begins by planting his characters inside the worlds where they exist. On a certain level, Dom is a character that DiCaprio could portray in his sleep, a wounded charmer oozing both confidence and vulnerability. Yet, this is easily DiCaprio's best performance in years, a disciplined and layered, hypnotic and vulnerable turn that will leave you pondering his image long after the closing credits have rolled by. DiCaprio is surrounded by a stellar team that includes his right-hand man, Arthur (Joseph Gordon Levitt), Yusuf (Dileep Rao), Eames (Tom Hardy) and newcomer Ariadne (Ellen Page), who will help Dom construct the Dreamscapes. The mission, as simply as can be defined in the written word, is for Dom and his team to plant an idea into the dreams of a competitor (Cillian Murphy) on behalf of a powerful client, Saito (Ken Watanabe). If he is successful, Dom can be cleared of a crime and, more importantly, reunited with his children. Some will argue that technology overwhelms Inception, a reasonable argument given the sheer awesomeness of the film's imagery and special effects. Yet, when contemplated further, it simply is not true. Instead, Nolan remains a writer/director with tremendous integrity by creating and remaining committed to this multi-layered universe that incorporates the subconscious experience into the conscious experience. To have simply poured on the emotions would have been lazy, unimaginative filmmaking. Instead, the film's emotional experience is seen largely through the eyes of the subconscious experience and the result, at times muted and frustrating, is remarkably authentic if unnerving. In addition to DiCaprio's stellar performance, Joseph Gordon Levitt gives the film's workhorse performance with tremendous heart and muscle, while Marion Cotillard is marvelous as Mal, Dom's wife both consciously and subconsciously. The remainder of the supporting cast may very well be the year's best ensemble so far in 2010. Incredible kudos to Wally Pfister for simply astounding cinematography, while Hans Zimmer's original music will most assuredly be recognized come awards season. Inception does not achieve greatness, at times falling short of the blend between conscious and subconscious and at times crossing the line a tad too far into simple action thriller.  Yet, when so many Hollywood films settle for paint-by-numbers mediocrity it is impossible to not, minimally, have a deep appreciation for a film of such rich uniqueness, complexity and conviction. Destined to be on countless Top 10 lists come year's end, Inception is amazing and awe-inspiring cinema.",CKM_Doc6_Inception,CKM,Action,Negative,Inception
16,CKM_Doc7_Inception,"Dreams have the ability to both fascinate and bore. When immersed in a dream, we can live a double-life, gifting ourselves with magical powers and conjuring friends and family long departed for just one more embrace. Our dreams can also be terrifying, maelstroms brought forth by the malevolent forces of fear, shame and dark secrets. However, when relating our dreams or when listening to the dreams of someone else, the power of actually dreaming it is no longer there. While filled with more ideas than most summer blockbusters, the experience of watching Inception is sort of akin of listening to someone tell you about an amazing dream they had, for more than two hours. As Christopher Nolan, the director of the The Dark Knight and Memento has seen his reputation increase, he now leaves behind Caped Crusaders and dueling magicians and attempts to infuse a big Hollywood blockbuster with more heady ideas than we ve seen in a film of this size since The Matrix. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Cobb, the leader of a team of saboteurs who enter people s dreams as they sleep and convince them to divulge sensitive information and secrets. But dreamscapes are not rooted in reality and entering the mind of the dreamer is difficult for Cobb and his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), especially when the dreamer s subconscious mounts its own attack. Luckily, if you die while in a dream you just wake up. More on that later. After a convoluted introduction that features more twists and double-crosses than an episode of  24  (and not in a good way), Nolan settles down to inform us of the film s plot: Cobb is hired by business magnate Saito (Ken Watanabe) to infiltrate the mind of competitor Cillian Murphy s Robert Fischer, Jr. not to extract information, but to implant a notion. Unfortunately, this is a much more difficult task, where Cobb must not only enter the dreamer s subconscious, but the dreams within the dreams of the dreams. Woof! Oh yeah, when you re in that deep, you don t just wake up if you re killed. Once Inception moves into its second half and we enter Fischer s dreams, the film becomes a taut exercise in suspense where things that occur during one level of consciousness trickle down and affect all the other layers. Nolan masterfully weaves all these elements together, creating a second act that is breathtaking, suspenseful and thought-provoking. Unfortunately, it takes us a good hour for us to get there. First, we must learn why DiCaprio s character is such a brooding mess (his wife died and she still haunts his subconscious), Cobb must assemble and train his team (including the out of place Ellen Page) and elude some baddies that have half-baked intentions at best. But what proves truly deadly to the film s first half is the lack of wonder we should feel as Nolan takes us through dreams where landscapes shift like an Escher painting and characters defy gravity. Instead, Inception remains coolly clinical in its presentation without an ounce of humor or marvel. Cobb says it himself when hiring Page s character, luring her with the chance to  build cathedrals, entire cities. Things that couldn t exist in the real world.  What a missed opportunity. Also problematic is DiCaprio s character. Hewing quite closely to the brooding and anguished role he played earlier this year in Martin Scorsese s Shutter Island, Inception s Cobb is broody and anguished from dealing with a similar tragedy. DiCaprio has been making brave choices in the last decade, eschewing the poster boy he could have become following Titanic, but how about picking a role with some levity next time? It s wearing thin. While there may be a lot of complaints in this review, I do not want to imply I disliked Inception. The second half is exciting and there are more ideas going here than in the typical summer popcorn flick. However, for all the advance buzz and critical kow-towing assigned Christopher Nolan, I remember another film from years ago that explored the same thin line between dreaming and waking life. Total Recall may have aged, but it is loaded with the infectious energy Inception lacks. Movies are supposed to be like dreams, pauses from the garish light of reality. Inception could use a little more dreamer in its dreams.",CKM_Doc7_Inception,CKM,Action,Negative,Inception
17,CKM_Doc8_Inception,"What with The Matrix, Avatar and now this, lying twitching in your sleep with electrodes stuck to your head could be the new rock'n'roll. Christopher Nolan's new movie is a colossal digital artefact, a virtual reality sci-fi thriller set inside the dreaming mind, with brilliant architectural effects and a weirdly inert narrative inspired by Philip K Dick and Lewis Carroll. At some stage in the distant future, the technology of industrial espionage will allow snoopers to invade the dreams of CEOs and pinch commercially sensitive information. Leonardo DiCaprio is Cobb, a specialist who both carries out these hi-tech brain raids and trains executives to resist them. He operates with a crew of occult brain specialists who operate as if they are planning a heist or a con, drugging top business honchos, installing vast, detailed imaginary worlds inside their minds where they go into a lucid dreaming state, letting their subconscious guard down, in which condition his team will appear in various role-play guises and trick them into revealing, as it were, the recipe for Diet Coke. Japanese plutocrat Saito (Ken Watanabe) offers Cobb the challenge of a lifetime: not to steal an idea, but to plant one. He needs Cobb to insinuate himself into the dreams of a dangerous young business rival: Robert Fischer Jr (Cillian Murphy) and somehow instil in him a determination to break up the family empire that is hurting Saito's profits. Cobb assembles an elite squad of cerebro-hackers including Ariadne (Ellen Page), Eames (Tom Hardy) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). They plan to drug Fischer on a 10-hour plane flight and create a triple-decker dream, a dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream   which, Narnia-like, will last 10 years in Fischer's dreaming mind. At the end of this, he will have arrived at a settled determination to break up his family firm. And he doesn't simply go to the deepest level first and then attain reality up through two successive waking episodes: he goes down, and down, and down. He, and we, could get something like decompression sickness: the bends. And there's another problem; Cobb is plagued with guilty visions of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), invading this synapse world and threatening to become more real than either Cobb's trickster dreams or his waking life. There are some dizzying flourishes of FX magic in this movie. Cobb and Ariadne go for a stroll in the streets of Paris, which Nolan folds and tweaks and twists, with the avenues rising and falling like a pop-up book. They encounter a street that rises in front of them like a sheer rockface and, bracing a foot against it first, like Fred Astaire dancing around the walls in Royal Wedding, they proceed to walk straight upwards. Later, Arthur will fight with goons in a virtual hotel that suddenly swivels around: they plunge down a corridor that has become vertical, like a lift shaft, and later they will float around like spacemen or lost, drowning souls in a stateroom on the Titanic. The best moment comes before any of this, when, finding themselves chatting over coffee, Cobb remarks to Ariadne that the essence of a dream is that we only remember the middle, not the beginning. For example, he wonders idly, how did they reach this cafe? With rising panic, Ariadne realizes she has no idea, and that they are in a dream that Cobb has created. Playfully, brilliantly, Nolan has exploited the cinematic convention of the ""cut"": we, the audience, have accepted without question our own unexplained arrival in the middle of this scene. Nolan is occasionally described as the inheritor of Stanley Kubrick's mantle, and there are allusions. The encounter between Cobb and Fischer in the weirdly long hotel bar with its undersea-lighting, feels like The Shining, and the impossible tsunami-explosions of water or tinkling broken-glass showers are also derived from its famous lift shaft blood deluge. Fischer's final encounter with his father (Pete Postlethwaite) bears a trace-memory of 2001. But I don't think Nolan is or wants to be the new Kubrick: Gaspar No  has a much greater claim with his forthcoming film Enter the Void. It is tempting to say that Nolan is the new Lewis Gilbert, director of The Spy Who Loved Me. At the third dream-level, DiCaprio and Murphy find themselves skiing in naff white military snowsuit outfits   much less cool than the formalwear they modelled in the hotel   towards a perfunctorily imagined Dr Evil-style mountainside HQ. I expected Roger Moore to zoom up, raise an eyebrow, and take out these cyper-whipper-snappers with a single elderly karate chop. Along with technical brilliance and ingenuity, there is something disconcertingly self-important about Inception with a plot that clogs and flags markedly in its final act, and, however gasp-inducing its effects and invented worlds, the story's drive stalls; I can never suppress the suspicion that something more interesting might be happening in ordinary, unassuming waking reality. Invention runs lower once we're on those snowy slopes, and the hard narrative punch keeps disintegrating into a floating cloud of pixels. But what a display they make.",CKM_Doc8_Inception,CKM,Action,Negative,Inception
18,CKM_Doc9_Inception,"Early in Inception, Leonardo DiCaprio tests Ellen Page s puzzle-making skills by telling her to draw a maze in two minutes that takes one minute to solve. That s not unlike the challenge writer-director Christopher Nolan shouldered with this movie: Take a decade s worth of development and compress it into a summer flick people can absorb in 148 minutes. Nolan tends to stuff too many ideas in his movies, which is better than having too few. But he hasn t solved his compression puzzle with Inception. The world of the movie is compelling enough to generate a novel, a video game, maybe an HBO series. (And I d buy all of them.) As a feature film, it s a frenetic dash. Inception has more emotional heft than The Matrix and Avatar, but not enough to be the thoughtful sci-fi classic it might have been. That s because, when plot and exposition are compressed to the boiling point, there s not a lot of room to develop characters. And this movie has more than its share. DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a smooth guy in a suit who earns his keep by stealing people s secrets from inside their dreams. Basically, he s a high-tech cat burglar of the subconscious. Japanese mogul Saito (Ken Watanabe) asks Cobb to take on a last big job: Implant an idea   in the mind of the heir to a rival business empire (Cillian Murphy)   instead of extracting one. That s called inception. To accomplish this feat, the dream thief assembles a full support team. Joseph Gordon-Levitt runs point; Page creates the dream s internal  architecture ; Tom Hardy impersonates pieces of the dreamer s subconscious; Dileep Rao provides the drugs that make it all possible; and Marion Cotillard ... well, she s not on the team. As DiCaprio s estranged, sexy, violence-prone wife, she just keeps popping up in his dream world and sending him into throes of angsty reacting not seen since Shutter Island, where the actor was similarly afflicted with spectral-spouse issues. The thing is, our protagonist needs to have more than DiCaprio seems able to offer ... a dark edge, a hint of real madness under his veneer of control. As Page notes when she visits one of his dreams,  You have quite a subconscious on you.  I wish Nolan had cast someone who could convey that   such as Hardy, who was riveting in last year s Bronson and stands out in this film, too, where he s mostly comic relief. Comic relief matters, though. Nolan s films benefit from the presence of a raspy-voiced clown to mock the hero s high-mindedness   Joe Pantoliano s Teddy in Memento, the Joker in The Dark Knight. Here, the closest we get to an effective foil is Cotillard, though she is pretty husky voiced (and scary). Inception has the seeds of a good drama with something to say about dreams and why we need them and how they can take over our lives. (In one scene, we see a room full of supine people who are addicted to dreaming the way some people are addicted to video games.) But Nolan is so eager to make the movie work as an action blockbuster that he sacrifices storytelling to set pieces. Still, what set pieces. Some critics have suggested that Nolan s dreamscapes, with their focus on architecture and  levels,  are less like dreams than video games. Maybe. But way back in the 1820s, Thomas de Quincey wrote of his opium-induced dreams,  the splendors of my dreams were ... chiefly architectural: and I beheld such pomp of cities and palaces as was never yet beheld by the waking eye, unless in the clouds.  The splendor and pomp of deserted cities, washed by apocalyptic sunsets and backed by a pounding Hans Zimmer soundtrack   Inception offers those stimulants, along with an ending that s not soon forgotten. It may not be a great maze, but it is amazing.",CKM_Doc9_Inception,CKM,Action,Negative,Inception
19,CKM_Doc10_Inception,"Captain Picards' hollow deck meets Mr. Spock's 3D chess game on the cutting room floor of The Matrix. I suppose how you feel about Inception depends on whether you compare it to Nolan's Batman movies, which I have not seen, or his brilliant breakout film, Memento, which I have seen more than once. Perhaps both of these comparisons are misguided and Inception should be evaluated in the company of other big budget, head-trippy futuristic fare, with or without sci-fi trappings; Minority Report, Vanilla Sky, Total Recall, Brazil, and no doubt lots of other stuff I've never seen. Be this as it may, I am inclined to compare Inception to Memento because the former so plainly presents itself as a thinking man's action thriller, with a complex psychological premise we are expected to find as engaging as the one around which Nolan constructed Memento. It would be easy merely to dismiss Inception's failure on this score as being the result of it saddling its complex psychological premise with way too much action thriller baggage. Clearly, the intense drama achieved by the low-budget, street life, daylight Noir of Memento is not even approximated by the capital-intensive, fantasy land, CGI overload of Inception. But the real problem with Inception has to do with its complex psychological premise in the first place. In the first place, it's truly not complex at all. Set aside all the mumbo-jumbo tech talk about how there are concentric rings of the unconscious that can be induced, invaded and controlled by others from without. What remains is the most banal, coffee-table Freudian stuff. So much smoke and mirrors about how to manipulate the inner workings of the mind through the power of suggestion, only to trot out and ride the tried and true hobbyhorse of a father figure fixation. Jesus, why not simply put the billionaire victim in intensive (and expensive) psychotherapy, let him take forever to get over daddy, and take over his inherited company while he's preoccupied on the couch. In the second place, the psychological premise is way too complex. On this score, the demands of the action thriller really are at fault. In order to establish the changing situations that facilitate the variety of thrilling action, the Byzantine architecture of the head-trippy plot takes on ever more inconsistent proportions that must be justified by ad hoc explanations in the dialogue. The constitutional articles of the psychological premise are continually undergoing congressional amendment. Just when being murdered in a dream is the mechanism for waking up in reality, this ceases to be the case and an entirely different mechanism is introduced. Just when there is definitely a mechanism of some sort - any sort - to ensure waking up in reality, this ceases to be the case and an entirely different and deeper ring of the unconscious is introduced, from which it may be impossible escape. The tolerance of the audience is over-taxed. And in the opinion of this taxpayer, the whole conceptual government deserves to be voted out of office. The incessant explanation of the psychological architecture saddles the action just as much as the action saddles the psychology; i.e., the supposedly thrilling action ain't that thrilling. In the third place, and most of all, the psychological premise of Inception is based on an utterly false model of the human mind. The unconscious is not OFF while we are awake and ON while we are asleep. Any type of so-called ""depth psychology"" (as distinct from any sort of behaviorism) begins with the notion that there is an UN-conscious that is so because it is SUB-conscious. A depth psychology may make much of the workings of the unconscious while we dream during sleep. But any such particular emphasis is on behalf of and not at the expense of grasping the workings of the unconscious in general, including while we are awake. The interpretation of dreams may be considered the most immediate way to encounter the unconscious, but the contradictory relations between it and the conscious mind are more readily apparent when the mind is, in fact, conscious. And the whole point about the simultaneous running of our necessarily irrational subterranean wheels and our potentially rational surface wheels is that these two sets of gears are not working in tandem, to put it mildly. Inception treats the unconscious as even more than working in tandem with the conscious. The film presents the unconscious as nothing other than a replication of the conscious, a mechanical template that adheres to the same rational rules of motion, freaky-deaky surreal special effects notwithstanding. With this in place, an infinite number of templates may be cast in the service of the plot, but the result is a bogus technologization of the mind that reduces it to the levels of a video game. This is most unfortunate. The psychological premise of Inception is tremendously ambitious. The film attempts to explore collectively experienced dream-states or socially inter-penetrative mental constructions. It goes about this in a manner that is significantly less psychologically materialist than the still dramatically far-fetched exploration of anterograde amnesia without retrograde amnesia in Memento. Nevertheless, Inception does not have even the most modest reliance on quick-fix metaphysics or wacky spiritualism. The whole business is conducted under the influence of external brain stimulation, both physio-chemical and socio-communicative. It's all mumbo-jumbo tech talk, of course, but I listened raptly to every word until it became so much shell-game speech without a pea of psychological substance. As far as Leo product goes, I much preferred Shutter Island.",CKM_Doc10_Inception,CKM,Action,Negative,Inception
130,AHT_Doc1_NoTimeToDie,"What a ride it has been for Daniel Craig. He first slid into the tuxedo of the dapper 007 back in 2006. Fifteen years and five movies later Craig wraps up his terrific run with the 25th installment in the James Bond franchise,  gNo Time to Die h. Due to several reasons (a global pandemic chief among them), we haven ft had a Bond film since 2015. That fs a long time, but I fm happy to say it was well worth the wait.  I was pretty lukewarm on James Bond movies until Craig came along. His first entry  gCasino Royale h blew me away. I like his second film, the flawed  gQuantum of Solace h more than most. I loved his third movie  gSkyfall h but was more mixed on his fourth,  gSpectre h. With  gNo Time to Die h, Craig is given the chance to end his tenure on a sky-high note. And boy does he.  Directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga,  gNo Time to Die h comes packaged with everything you want from a Bond movie ? big action, even bigger characters, plenty of style, and a special dash of heart. But Craig fs movies have added grit to that list. His Bond carries the weight of loss, and his pain often pushes him outside the bounds of agency protocol. That emotional burden and his willingness to cross the line are traits that set his 007 apart from all the rest.  This near $300 million sequel comes with a collection of old familiar faces as well as a few new ones. And once again this latest world-saving mission takes Bond (and us) to locations across the globe ? Italy, Jamaica, Cuba, Norway, and of course London. And then you have the story itself which is not only thrilling blockbuster material, but it nails the tricky task of completing Daniel Craig es story arc. And it does it in an profoundly satisfying way.  The film begins with James having retired from MI6 and enjoying what resembles a normal life with Madeleine (a returning L?a Seydoux). But while on a romantic getaway in the exquisitely shot Matera, Italy, the couple are reminded why they fre always looking over their shoulders. Assassins sent by the nefarious crime syndicate Spectre ambush James leading to an exhilarating action sequence through the heart of the scenic city. Bond and Madeleine manage to escape, but he suspects her of betraying and the two split up.  Five years and one Billie Eilish Bond theme later, James is living in seclusion on a beach in Jamaica when he fs contacted by old friend and CIA field officer Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright). Felix needs Bond fs help tracking down a kidnapped scientist (David Dencik) who has developed a DNA-targeting bioweapon known as  gProject Heracles h. Obviously, in the wrong hands the bioweapon could be catastrophic. And those hands happen to belong to Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek), a soft-spoken yet vengeful terrorist leader who has an axe to grind with Spectre and has a rather gnarly connection to Madeleine fs past. And just like that, Bond is back in the game.  From there the road gets curvier. Bond butts heads with MI6, particularly M (Ralph Fiennes) and a brash young 00 agent named Nomi (Lashana Lynch). The devilish Ernst Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) is still running Spectre from prison. And of course Madeleine resurfaces, now working as a psychotherapist for MI6, a job that puts her right in the crosshairs of the string-pulling madman Safin. And there are even more characters with parts to play including CIA agent Paloma (a wide-eyed and delightful Ana de Armas) who assists Bond in Cuba. And of course Q (Ben Whishaw) and Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) make welcomed returns.  But this is very much Bond fs movie. Not just in the traditional sense, but personally and emotionally. From its action-packed earliest frames,  gNo Time to Die h has a different pull than Craig fs other films in the franchise. Part of it may be psychological. We know this is Craig fs last ride and that realization inevitably adds some extra feeling for fans. But it fs also a conscious move from Fukunaga who manages to keep his film tonally in-tune with the others while putting a warm and empathetic spotlight on the weary and pained super spy. It fs a slippery balancing act, but Fukunaga nails it.  Also, the movie looks amazing. Whether he fs capturing a location or shooting an elaborate action sequence, Oscar-winning DP Linus Sandgren always gives us something worth looking at. I mentioned the stunning opening in Italy. There fs also an impeccably shot edge-of-your-seat car chase/shootout in Norway. And of course, the big finish which features one particularly jaw-dropping close-quartered gunfight up a flight of stairs. Sandgren is constantly treating us to one breathtaking shot after another and frequently reminding us of why movies are always better on the big screen.  But what may be most impressive is how the movie flies by despite a hefty running time of 2 hours 43 minutes. I only checked my watch once and that was out of curiosity rather than boredom. Much of it has to do with Fukunaga fs crisp pacing and steady mix of drama and action. He never lets things get bogged down. At the same time, he never loses sight of his characters. Again, it fs a balance the film maintains that keeps it lively and engaging.  So how does  gNo Time to Die h match up with Craig fs other Bond movies. Well, I fm not ready to put it next to the superb  gCasino Royale h, but it fs only a step or two below it. Not only has Cary Joji Fukunaga made a good Bond movie, but this is the kind entertainment I look for out of blockbusters. But perhaps most important for 007 fans, Fukunaga gives Craig a swan song that does him and his fifteen years spent On Her Majesty fs Secret Service justice. It fs a top-to-bottom fabulous finish for (dare I even say it) my favorite Bond of the franchise.  gNo Time to Die h opens today in theaters.",AHT_Doc1_NoTimeToDie,AHT,Action,Positive,No time to die
131,AHT_Doc2_NoTimeToDie,"I fve written elsewhere about the reasons that I sat down in a sour state of mind to the swan song of the Daniel Craig James Bond movies, No Time to Die, but what fs the actual film like itself? The Craig years have been a bumpy ride; the promising but bloated Casino Royale, the paper-thin Quantum of Solace, the all-time high of Skyfall, the messy doldrums of Spectre, and finally No Time To Die. The problem, as with Star Wars and most other franchises is, the longer it goes on, the more you realise that they fre just making it up as they go along.  Things start brightly with some retconning; we fre introduced to previous relationship Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux) and as soon as she blurts out  ethere fs something I fve been meaning to tell you, f we know that she fs pregnant and that Bond now has a daughter and a family to protect. This protect-your-family motivation is contrary to Bond lore, but it helps that the notion is cannily dropped in the middle of a stylish Aston Martin chase through an ancient Italian town; the disguise just about sugar-coats the contradictions. A second set piece, a fire-fight in a Santiago night-club for Blofeld fs birthday party, also lands well, but things start to fall apart with the introduction of the new young, black and gifted female OO7 (Lashana Lynch); James Bond has retired after all. Over an hour of inane, static chat then follow without Bond even picking up a gun; we eventually unite Bond with his family in Scotland, but off-the-shelf baddie Safin (Rami Malek) is still waiting on his island lair with plans to annihilate the world, and all that dark foreshadowing can ft really go for nothing.  No Time to Die can ft really be faulted for the action scenes, which are terse, well-realised and technically superb. But the key element of humour is missing; Phoebe Waller-Bridge was drafted in to pep the script up, but sophistication is MIA, with gags that would elicit groans in the Roger Moore era. The new 007 drops down onto a dance-floor, shoots an assailant and quips  eMind if I cut in? f Cringe. Even the serious-minded Skyfall stooped to double-taking underground passengers for cheap laughs, but the tired one-liners here take away from the big reveal; spoiler alerts, James Bond finally gets killed. That should be a big deal for a 20th century icon, but after besting so many adversaries, to see Bond bite the bullet at the hands of a no-mark villain who cuts around in his dressing gown is a whopping anti-climax. And it fs painful listening to the new and old 007 squabbling about who should have the title; they sound like toddlers in a playground, but the familiar punchline is that the uppity woman gets slapped down. Thanks, Phoebe Waller-Bridge. Ana de Armas achieves far more for women in her memorable ten minute turn, but alas, her character is ignored for the rest of the film.  Craig has proved himself as a great James Bond, and probably deserved an encore; it fs just a shame that No Time To Die has no idea what the greatest hits should be, and the actor seems bored with the role. Craig joined the franchise at a time when films were still planned one by one, and the lack of any over-arcing direction scuppers any sense of continuity over his five movies. Oddities like a cameo from Gromit the dog, or Bond mentioning The Book of Mormon, feel like something of a stretch for an out-dated character whose claim to wokeness seems to be that his friends are all black. Cary J Fukunaga seems to have been doing the best he can with a salvage job here, and there fs a nice choice of Jack London quote to finish, but no action film can ingest a full hour without any action to speak of. The final James Bond Will Return caption feels more like a threat than a promise unless his producers can find a valid reason for him to do so.",AHT_Doc2_NoTimeToDie,AHT,Action,Negative,No time to die
132,AHT_Doc3_NoTimeToDie,"With the inventive American filmmaker Cary Joji Fukunaga at the helm, the 25th film in the official James Bond franchise is a dark and assured piece of filmmaking, enjoyable from start to finish. And that finish line seems a long way away at a whopping 146 minutes, the longest Bond film to date.  The earlier Bond films stood narratively alone but since the franchise's reinvention with the Daniel Craig Bond in the 2006 Casino Royale, the film's plots have bled into each other.  The 'Bond girl' in No Time To Die, Lea Sedoux's Dr Madeleine Swann, is the daughter of Jesper Christensen's Mr White from Casino Royale and as this film opens we meet her as a young girl, escaping the clutches of Rami Malek's villain Lyutsifer Safin.  Years later, Swann and her lover James Bond are holidaying in Italy. Swann wants James to visit the grave of Vesper Lynd, the lover whose death still haunts the secret agent.  Lynd's grave is a trap for Bond and, surviving the explosion, Bond is convinced that it was Swann who has tried to kill him, and he puts her on a train and tells her they will never see each other again.  His heart broken a second time, Bond escapes to his home in the Caribbean and gives up life as a British secret agent.  But we're only a quarter of the way through the film, and Bond is pulled back into action by his old CIA pal Felix Lighter (Jeffrey Wright) who, along with agents Logan Ash (Billy Magnussen) and Paloma (Ana de Armas) attempt to take down a meeting of the organisation Spectre.  That mission doesn't go quite to plan for reasons involving the return of Lyutsifer Safin, heir to a chemical weapons dynasty, and the theft of a genetic weapon developed in Britain by the scientist Obruchev (David Dencik). It's up to Bond to return to his old stomping ground and assist the likes of former boss M (Ralph Fiennes), Q (Ben Whishaw) and Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) to save the world. Again.  Cary Joji Fukunaga is obviously a great Bond fan, and fellow devotees will enjoy his constant referencing of previous adventures and visual elements. The usual Bond film moments are here - the car chases, the opulence, the violence.  I loved the humour of revisited Bond tropes - the funeral procession impeding the car chase - and the revisiting of Louis Armstrong's We Have All the Time in the World from the 1969 Bond On Her Majesty's Secret Service, referenced a number of times in the dialogue and musically over the closing credits.  Fukunaga shares screenplay credit with some big names including long-time Bond writers Neale Purvis and Robert Wade working with Phoebe Waller-Bridge of Killing Eve fame.  You can only imagine who wrote which line but I'd like to think Waller-Bridge is behind the smart female characters driving the narrative, replacing the superfluous bikini-clad adornments of Connery-era Bond.  Among those smart women is Cuban actress An de Armas paired with her Knives Out co-star Daniel Craig. The two have a brilliant chemistry on screen and she brings an ease to one of the film's funnier roles as an undercover CIA operative in Cuba.  Without spoiling her role in the film for you, Lashana Lynch too is a brilliant paring with Craig, who looks rode hard and put away wet throughout most of the film. Physically, he is so much more believable as a hardened killer than his predecessors.  There is a moment early in the film, in the stone Puglia township of Vesper Land's grave, where Madeleine and James write secrets on pieces of paper and then set them on fire, setting their secrets free. If only it were all that simple, of course, but filmmaker Fukunaga makes it all seem simple. If you've seen his ground-breaking television crime drama True Detective, you know he is a skilled weaver of multiple threads, capable of subtlety and enormous moments.  Bond has a charismatic charm, the plotting is contemporary and the villains are everywhere and they're as understandable as they are fallible.  The staging is as expected, gorgeous locales including Puglia, Norway and Britain, and a particular note, amongst all the craftspeople and artisans working behind the scenes, on the film's lighting design. The Cuban scenes particularly are dripping in blue washes over wet streets, and the villain's lair at the film's end is designed with geometric walls of dust-flecked light for James to moodily stalk through.  Perhaps the most surprising thing about No Time To Die is how effectively its studio was able to lock it down for 18 months from its originally intended release date of Easter 2020, just as the COVID pandemic had other ideas. No leaks along the way, it has been something to look forward to, and worth the wait over what has been a rough few years for all of us.",AHT_Doc3_NoTimeToDie,AHT,Action,Positive,No time to die
133,AHT_Doc4_NoTimeToDie,"A case of one mission too many, No Time to Die is a mediocre conclusion to the Daniel Craig era of James Bond movies, complete with a banal, confusing villainous performance from Rami Malek that suits the films tone.  A few years ago, Daniel Craig openly admitted that he had no desire to reprise the role of James Bond again. After all Spectre, for all its foibles, concluded with Bond walking away from the spy-life with new beau Dr. Madeline Swan (Lea Seydoux) by his side. It was the perfect bookend, yet  gperfect bookend h is not allowed in a franchise that still has its star available and in peak physical condition. It fs just a shame that No Time to Die squanders its farewell to the Daniel Craig era, with the 25th Bond one of the most lacklustre in story and stakes.  No Time to Die begins with Bond enjoying his post-007 life with Swan, before he is thrust back into secret agent mode when a new enemy, Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek) targets everyone Bond loves while (shock! horror!) putting into motion a plan to take over the world. Now back in MI6, Bond teams up with new agents in the form of disarming CIA operative Paloma (Ana de Armas) and a new 007 in Nomi (Lashana Lynch) in a bid to save the world and those he loves within it.  With a runtime of 163 minutes, there is a lot to consume in No Time to Die and a lot of it does not go down well. Director Cary Joji Fukunaga (Beasts of No Nation) continues the visual approach Sam Mendes developed with Skyfall and Spectre (respectfully), yet he is saddled with a screenplay overwrought and frustratingly complicated in its attempt to put a bow on the Daniel Craig-era of the James Bond story that plays for easy thrills and cheap payoffs.  The films core, a love story between Bond and Swan, is never given enough time to develop into a meaningful connection upon which the emotional stakes of love and betrayal can truly manifest into characters worth investing in. Making matters so much worse is the performance by Rami Malek as the ridiculously named Lyutsider Safin, a culturally confused villain of clenched jaw intensity and fetish for all things Japanese, spouting monologues of little comprehension and evoking even less emotion.  The action sequences are impressive in choreography and craft, the 53-year-old Craig (and his stunt team) maintaining his status as the best action-man Bond we fve seen yet. Great too is Ava de Amos in a scene stealing performances as a wide-eyed CIA agent whose aim is as potent as her sex appeal.  Back to Daniel Craig. While he doesn ft have the GOAT status of Sean Connery, the once dubbed  gugly Bond h has capped of his run as 007 with a strong turn both physical and emotional. It is just a shame that it couldn ft be utilised in a better movie, with No Time to Die a send-off of convenience rather than deserving merit.

134,AHT_Doc5_NoTimeToDie,"James Bond has and always will be one of the most unique franchises around. With a legacy that spans nearly six decades, it has found new directions, as well as old patterns, to thrive in any era a new film releases. There fs an extraordinary amount of expectation for any actor who inhabits this famous role, but there has been something distinct about the tenure of Daniel Craig. His modern interpretation is the longest on record, and as such, his impact on the series has been enormous. It fs been well documented that  gNo Time to Die h would be his final bow as the character. One can definitely feel that thesis statement throughout this film, which ends up being an enthralling and finely crafted sendoff.  Picking up shortly after the last film fs events, Bond and Madeleine (Le? Seydoux) are enjoying the bliss of each other fs company until a suspected betrayal drives a wedge between them. Bond goes off to live an isolated life, officially retiring from the service. However, allies from his past once again call upon him, and Bond feels compelled to be drawn into a sinister plot. The web of intrigue includes the mysterious Safin (Rami Malek), hellbent on hunting down those closest to Bond while also involving himself in acquiring a deadly weapon with the potential of catastrophic annihilation. Joined by a new agent Nomi (Lashana Lynch), Bond must stop mass destruction again while also reconciling with the demons that haunt him.  Craig is in a rather unique position with his final entry into the beloved franchise. While nearly every actor has exited the role on their own terms, this is the first time the last entry has been planned with any kind of foresight. Perhaps this is what elevates his performance to something with much more emotional pathos than has ever been seen before. He still perfectly embodies the physicality and the shrewd coldness that has always marked the character. However, a vulnerability comes through in a way that feels unique to Craig fs abilities as an actor. He comes tantalizingly close to the heights of his debut in  gCasino Royale, h and here, he provides a turn that is brutal yet soulful at the same time. He infuses the role of James Bond with a tenderness that is much appreciated, particularly with the recognition of his final endeavor.  As much as the leading man has been an essential fixture in this series, so too has been the supporting players around him. The love interest and the villain are always the two biggest staples of a James Bond film, and Seydoux shows much improvement from her first appearance in  gSpectre. h Her chemistry with Craig can still be stilted at times, but the complexities of the role are more fleshed out this time, and she handles it well. Malek delivers a genuinely unsettling turn, though one does feel his presence is underused. It fs a quieter, almost nondescript, portrayal and a far cry from the flamboyance one would expect from a Bond villain. He does slightly underwhelm, but he carries a significant screen presence at the same time.  The rest of the cast delivers fine performances as well. The returning core of allies are in top form once again, with Naomi Harris fs Moneypenny, Ben Whishaw fs Q, Jeffrey Wright fs Felix Leiter, and Ralph Fiennes fs M all delivering consistently compelling work. Some of the newer additions are solid without ever making a meaningful impression, most notably Billy Magnussen and, to a lesser degree, Ana de Armas. She has some fun interplay, but it fs a small role with only ten minutes of screen time in the least exciting section of the story. The real standout is Lynch as the successor to the 007 title, and she holds her own marvelously well. The banter she has with Craig is effectively humorous and provides some of the most delightful moments in the film.  Cary Joji Fukunaga famously may not have been the first choice for director, but his efforts end up creating some uproariously entertaining and truly exhilarating set-pieces. Aided by Linus Sandgren fs vibrant cinematography, Hans Zimmer fs engaging score, and an inventive sound design, the aesthetics are extraordinary and all help to shape the lush environments. There is also an intimacy brought to every frame, even the large-scale action scenes that can have a grounded realism amongst the bombast. One definitely feels the care brought to the filmmaking. There are also so many acknowledgments to the previous Bond adventures that will make diehard fans particularly happy. At 163 minutes, this is the longest James Bond film ever, and Fukunaga does struggle with the pacing, particularly after the first act when the momentum has a habit of stalling. Still, his craftsmanship as a filmmaker is suited well to this material.  The script is another aspect with some strong elements, though it oftentimes is the weakest part of the overall film. A crowded list of names that includes series f regular scribes Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, as well the Fukunaga and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, succeeds at evolving the emotional bonds of the characters in methods that feel more genuine and emotionally impactful. It also wrestles with a narrative that can get convoluted and messy. The dialogue can be intelligent and witty while also being wooden and hollow. The nuance of the characters varies wildly, and while there is an effective conclusion to the arc of this particular presentation of Bond, the road to get there was and is a bit bumpy. Still, the series has seen much worse screenplays, and while parts of the plot could fve been better, it compensates with the greater attention to character.   gNo Time to Die h is, without a doubt, one of the most ambitious Bond films to date. It makes bold choices that push the franchise in new directions, and it can be exciting and concerning to watch them unfold for diehard fans. However, the strengths of the filmmaking, the care given towards the writing, and the endearing performances make this a success, particularly for Daniel Craig. The film leaves one with a bittersweet farewell to the legacy that Craig has cemented while also maintaining a sense of optimism for what the future may hold. That is a difficult needle to thread, and for the most part, Craig and company have managed to do just that.",AHT_Doc5_NoTimeToDie,AHT,Action,Positive,No time to die
135,AHT_Doc6_NoTimeToDie,"Do you know that awful feeling when you anticipate something (in this case, a film) for so long, only to end up with a bitter disappointment? Well, that fs exactly how I felt after I watched No Time to Die. Seriously, even after the end credits roll, I was sitting there in the dark and kept wondering why the long-awaited and of course, long-delayed Daniel Craig-era Bond film doesn ft turn out as good as I really wanted it to be. I mean, given the calibre of Cary Joji Fukunaga, who made such a lasting impression in the first season of HBO fs True Detective, I figure he fs the right man for the job even after the original director Danny Boyle bailed out due to creative differences.   It fs not that No Time to Die is entirely a letdown because the film does get off to a promising start. This includes the extended pre-credits sequence detailing a violent flashback and later, the Matera-set chase involving a motorcycle (the incredible bike jump still wowed me on the big screen even after seeing that scene being heavily promoted in numerous trailers) and a souped-up Aston Martin DB5, complete with Gatling guns and smokescreen.  For a while there, it was a well-paced series of taut and escalating moments, with the exception of Cary Joji Fukunaga fs penchant for shooting the action setpieces using lots of fast camera movements and editing that feels like he can ft wait to move on to the next scene. In other words, for all the supposedly exciting moments that occurred on the screen, he doesn ft let us sink in and fully enjoy the elaborate choreography. Besides, what fs the point of spending so much money (a whopping US$250 million!) with one of them used extensively for practical stunts if the film ends up being shot in an incomprehensible way?  Not to mention Cary Joji Fukunaga also botches the opportunity to elevate these scenes more cinematic since No Time to Die earns its distinction as the first Bond film to be partially shot with IMAX film cameras. It fs like how Michael Bay ruined the chance for making good use of IMAX film cameras when he shot them in Transformers: The Last Knight. The only significant difference between Fukunaga and Bay is that the latter did it a lot worse with his messed-up shaky-cam approach.  Following the Matera-set chase set pieces, subsequent action sequences are mostly a hit-and-miss affair, with the shootout in Cuba and the elaborate moment in the foggy forest are worth mentioning here. The former features Ana de Armas as Bond fs contact, Paloma and she certainly knows how to make an entrance in a stunning evening gown. She even brings a refreshingly cheeky and fun personality to her otherwise typical Bond girl persona and also proves to be an expert in martial arts and handling guns. If that fs not enough, she shares good chemistry with Daniel Craig fs Bond (they previously collaborated in 2019 fs Knives Out) while the whole Cuba scene brings an overall energetic vibe to a film that is mostly sullen and dead-serious.  Some other action sequences, however, do not really work out as well as I thought. Case in point includes the underwhelming final third act and even though it includes a would-be memorable moment shot in a single take (something that Cary Joji Fukunaga was already good at in True Detective), his decision to film it using a handheld camera instead of a smooth, Steadicam-style somehow diluted the excitement.  Now, for the plot: One should know that No Time to Die is a direct sequel to 2015 fs Spectre (that means it fs not a good idea to watch this as a standalone Bond film because the Daniel Craig-era of James Bond is one interconnected cinematic universe stretching all the way back to 2006 fs Casino Royale). When we last meet Bond and his lover, Madeleine Swann (L?a Seydoux) at the end of Spectre, we see them leaving together in an Aston Martin DB5. They are now having the time of their lives in Matera, Italy but it doesn ft take long before the past catches up with them.  Long story short, Bond learns that Swann is hiding something and he ends up living off the grid somewhere in Jamaica for five years. During those years where he is completely absent from active duty, his superior M (Ralph Fiennes) has since appointed Nomi (Lashana Lynch), an MI6 agent as the new 007. But Bond is back in action when his old friend, CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) wanted his help for a mission to locate a kidnapped scientist named Valdo Obruchev (David Dencik). The mission, in turn, has something to do with the mysterious Safin (Rami Malek) and a deadly new bioweapon.  Cary Joji Fukunaga, who also co-wrote the screenplay alongside Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, try so hard to tie up whatever loose ends left in the past four Bond films while bringing in a significant new character. That new character in question is Safin played by Rami Malek. Roping in an Oscar winner (he won Best Actor for his role as the late Freddie Mercury in 2018 fs Bohemian Rhapsody) is a nice touch and I figure Rami Malek can pull off a memorable villain.  Too bad that fs not the case because his character feels more like c an afterthought. He may have the creepy look, complete with a heavily-scarred face but the appearance alone isn ft enough to offset his lack of character development. We learn little about his so-called tragic backstory and even his motivation related to everyone involved and his plan to use the new bioweapon technology is as superficial as it comes.  It doesn ft help either when Bond doesn ft really interact with him until much later in the film and even by then, it fs all too little and too late. The film doesn ft forget Christoph Waltz fs Blofeld, who is previously seen in Spectre but instead of making good use of his appearance, it fs a pity that he fs wasted here. It was as if Cary Joji Fukunaga simply did everyone (fans of Waltz fs Blofeld, that is) a favour by adding him as mere fan service but hardly bother to give him anything substantial to work with.  Then, there fs the introduction of a new 007 agent in the form of Nomi played by Lashana Lynch. Her no-nonsense portrayal could have been useful if the story gives her something significant to make her character worthwhile. But like Christoph Waltz fs Blofeld, she too is wasted and her role is equivalent to a window dressing. What fs even worse is the lack of chemistry between her and Bond. Speaking of the latter, I was perhaps among the minorities who actually thought Daniel Craig and L?a Seydoux fs on-screen chemistry in Spectre. But in No Time to Die, I was surprised to see their chemistry is almost non-existent. It fs more like watching these two attractive couple looking all great on the big screen but little else matters when comes to delving into their characters deeper.  Cary Joji Fukunaga isn ft just content in giving us a typical Bond film as he also desperately wanted to subvert our expectations, particularly during the second half. While adding in something new would be a refreshing change of pace if done right, the second half of the film grows increasingly (and unnecessarily) convoluted and even murky in some moments.  Apart from the promising pre-credits opening sequence, No Time to Die has some good production values and Hans Zimmer fs riveting score, where he combines new musical composition with familiar Bond themes is equally praiseworthy.  As for the cast, Daniel Craig delivers a typically engaging performance in his fifth and final role as James Bond. It fs just too bad the story doesn ft justify all the sufferings that his character is forced to go through. The aforementioned Ana de Armas as Paloma is among the best things that ever happened in this film while Ben Whishaw and Naomie Harris, both respectively reprising Q and Moneypenny provide decent supports in their otherwise underwritten roles.  Well, so much for the would-be memorable send-off for the Daniel Craig-era of Bond films. Perhaps Cary Joji Fukunaga gets too ambitious to handle such an epic scope navigating the existing and new plot threads connected to the previous Bond films. The nearly three-hour length, the longest film ever seen in the history of the Bond franchise would have worked better with a shorter runtime (maybe around 130 minutes). And a tighter edit too, where they could have done without introducing Rami Malek fs Safin and his whole story connected to Blofeld and yes, even Madeleine Swann in the first place. Not especially how the story mishandled his character arc.",AHT_Doc6_NoTimeToDie,AHT,Action,Negative,No time to die
136,AHT_Doc7_NoTimeToDie,"Fifteen years after first donning the tuxedo, it fs time for Daniel Craig to take his final bow as James Bond. He arrives just as cinema is crying out for a hero: No Time To Die fs several delays (starting in March 2020) were a constant reminder of an industry still reeling from the last 18 months, and everyone involved with the big screen is hoping this is the release that brings audiences back en masse. So, is the 25th Bond film up to the mission?  We rejoin Craig fs Bond living a blissful life retired in The Caribbean, happy and in love with Dr Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux), his love interest from 2015 fs Spectre. His happy ending is curtailed by the double whammy of a devastating secret being revealed about Madeleine, and an old friend, Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), coming to him for help. These revelations put him on the trail of both a deadly chemical weapon with the potential to wipe out all life on the planet, and Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek), a terrorist intent on destroying everything Bond loves.  No Time To Die is almost impossible to review fully, as it would involve talking about revelations that would spoil the film. However, it fs safe to say it goes to places no Bond has dared in the past. Cary Joji Fukunaga, the director of True Detective and Beasts of No Nation, has the task of tying together a four movie arc into something that feels coherent, and absolutely succeeds.  There fs a blend of action and emotion that has rarely been attempted in the franchise, and while it bloats the running time (two hours and forty five minutes), each sequence feels rewarding. There are echoes of Skyfall in a sequence set at a birthday party, while there fs more than a hint of GoldenEye in the concrete walls of Safin fs lair. For all the motorcycle chases and shoot-outs, Bond fs most impressive feat is being vulnerable. This is the first version of the character to have continuity, rather than self-contained stories, and so it follows that in this fifth chapter he confesses to grief, a desire for vengeance, and love. We see him make apologies for the past, and confess hopes for the future. Yes, the martinis and glamour are still there, but Craig seems to relish these moments and the performance is all the richer for it.  He fs not the only star in this show. Much was made of the casting of Lashana Lynch as Nomi, an agent who has been assigned 007 in Bond fs absence. Many pearls were clutched at the thought of Bond being replaced, but in reality they happily co-exist. Nomi jousts with Bond, goading him about the three digits, to which he retorts  git fs just a number h, a signal that both characters are bigger than the label. Series regulars Ralph Fiennes, Naomi Harris, and Ben Whishaw all return, but in a film this busy only Whishaw fs Q really gets anything substantial to do. Similarly, a reunion with Craig fs Knives Out co-star Ana de Armas is equally short lived.  As revealed in the trailer, Christoph Waltz comes back as Blofeld, now contained in a glass cell; Hannibal Lecter with an upgrade. The involvement is brief, but his moments with Craig are packed with tension. The return of Blofeld does not, however, detract from No Time To Die fs main antagonist. In a film that sidesteps many expectations, Malek fs Safin is reassuringly traditional as the villain. Unblinking and dressed in ornate suits, his first appearance in the film fs opening minutes is unsettling enough for him to cast a shadow over everything that follows, his every entrance making your stomach drop.  The third act takes a big leap and ends with a choice that will divide audiences (and frustrate critics writing spoiler-free reviews). Those who want to see the decades old formula shaken up further will be delighted; others who find comfort in familiarity may feel blindsided.  Everyone has a different idea of what a James Bond movie should be, and there are likely to be different reactions to the way this story ends. However, it fs something everyone will be talking about, which is a fitting send-off for Craig. He fs the man who dragged 007 into the 21st Century with an edgier look, and he finishes his tenure with a lot of heart. There will be many James Bonds to come but few will do it this well.

137,AHT_Doc8_NoTimeToDie,"After 15 years and five films, Daniel Craig has retired from the role that brought him international fame and considerable treasure. Almost certainly unwittingly, Craig will also be associated with the demise of James Bond as we knew him and?if we take the ending of the movie at face value?there is no chance he will ever return.  Over the course of nearly 60 years, seven men have portrayed 007 in 25 official (and two unofficial) features and, while some of the casting transitions were bumpy, the franchise steadfastly continued without serious incident. This too will never happen again.  In acknowledging the release of  gNo Time to Die, h a colleague of mine remarked  gthe Bond movies were never that great to begin with and now they are even worse. h It fs unintentionally funny to be sure but also dead on the mark. None of the James Bond movies were ever designed to be high-brow, classical-cinematic affairs. They fve always been uncomplicated comfort-food movies. It fs not quite mindless twaddle, and it fs earmarked for a predominantly male audience looking for pure, unadulterated escapism. They were man-cave content before man-caves became an actual thing.  Trouble Began in 2018 Production problems for the movie began as far back as 2018 when original director Danny Boyle and screenwriter John Hodge left over  gcreative differences. h Roughly a half dozen A-list directors were considered as replacements until longtime producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson handed over the reins to Cary Joji Fukunaga, a guy with little action experience whose resume included a remake of  gJane Eyre h and the heralded but little seen  gBeasts of No Nations. h  In tandem with seven-time Bond scribes Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, Fukunaga wrote the screenplay with later uncredited rewrites by big guns Paul Haggis and Scott Z. Burns. It was Craig fs idea to bring in Phoebe Waller-Bridge (best known as the creator and star of the TV show  gFleabag h) for a final overhaul.  Few, if any movies in the history of film with this many writers have gone on to achieve greatness:  gNo Time to Die h is just the latest victim of a  gtoo many cooks h scenario.  If this were a labyrinthine dramatic affair along the lines of  gCitizen Kane h or  gChinatown, h that would be one thing, but this is a James Bond flick. All one needs to do is include gadgets, alluring love interests, cool cars, quippy one-liners, a diabolical villain, some fights, and a few chase scenes and boom?you fve got your movie. But that was then and this is now and apparently there is no longer room for the classic Bond in a 21st century.  Longest in Length, Shortest in Substance As the screenplay provides the foundation for all movies, it fs easy to understand why  gNo Time to Die h is such a colossal failure on so many fronts. With a running time of two hours, 43 minutes, this is the longest Bond movie ever, but oddly also the one with the least actual content. Operating more as a direct sequel to  gSpectre h or a Craig send-off party than an original film, it lumbers aimlessly across Europe and the Caribbean from one set piece to the next offering little in the way of variety or a cohesive narrative.  With Q (Ben Whishaw) now more concerned with putting together a quaint dinner for two, the number of  gnew h gadgets is reduced to two. L?a Seydoux (as Dr. Madeleine Swann) becomes the first back-to-back repeat  gBond girl h in franchise history. As Seydoux can act and is easy on the eyes, this isn ft a deal-killer but when compared to the extended cameo turned in by a sinuous and spunky Ana de Armas (Craig fs  gKnives Out h co-star), her sullen demeanor and lack of eye-popping Bond costuming falls a bit flat.  Missing the droll humor of his predecessors (especially Judi Dench), the returning Ralph Fiennes (at the behest of the writers) has turned MI6 executive M into an uber-serious and mirthless bore. More a cranky overseer than unifying leader, M thought nothing of handing over the then-retired Bond fs iconic  g007 h identity over to franchise newcomer Nomi (Lashana Lynch). Tasked with mostly running errands for the bulk of the movie, Nomi fs frequent head-butting with Bond is utterly unconvincing as is her 11th-hour change of heart.  Showing up along the way are longtime Bond characters Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) and villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) who will, more than likely, never appear in another Bond movie.  Worst Bond Villain Ever Every action movie (not just Bond outings) is only as good as the bad guy, and Rami Malek as Safin misses the mark and by a wide margin. The third straight Oscar-winner (after Waltz and Javier Bardem) to play a Bond villain, Malek fs Safin doesn ft show up in earnest until the 90-minute mark, and even then he has little in the way of personality and (unless you consider using a child as a human shield) offers no danger or palpable menace. A pockmarked facial complexion and lisping whisper are no substitutes for evil.  Knowing that this was going to be his last outing as Bond, Craig is ever the dutiful soldier. Following orders to the letter and proving once again that a single man with a pistol can take out scores of machine gun-toting thugs while receiving nary a scratch, Craig fs resigned Bond marks the end of a cherished era.  With a feeble and maudlin coda,  gNo Time to Die h is a perfect match for singer Billie Eilish fs coma-inducing opening credit theme song. We get a lame villain, a tame love interest, little technical dodads, few fights and chases, and next to no wit?what a pity that this perennial franchise, one which provided so much joy to so many fans the world over, has been obliterated.",AHT_Doc8_NoTimeToDie,AHT,Action,Negative,No time to die
138,AHT_Doc9_NoTimeToDie,"The James Bond franchise is legendary, but it certainly has its peaks and valleys. Each Bond era brings a different style. Six actors have played the iconic character over the course of 25 movies. Daniel Craig's casting was initially met with backlash, but the 2006 masterpiece Casino Royale proved a lot of people wrong. No Time to Die is Craig's fifth and final time starring in the role. Two of the entries in Craig's era are disappointing, but No Time to Die doesn't join Quantum of Solace and Spectre on that list.  No Time to Die opens on a house in a snow-covered landscape. A masked assailant descends upon the poor inhabitants to hunt down a specific target. The introduction plays out like a horror movie, including a home invasion and a creepy-masked killer. However, the movie quickly changes gears as Bond and Madeleine (L?a Seydoux) live their days together. The spy discovers that there's a lot he doesn't know about her past. Now, it's coming back to haunt them. Their volatile relationship is at the center of No Time to Die. Madeleine was previously introduced, but she's given a much stronger identity here. However, the focus doesn't shift from Bond.  No Time to Die is abundantly aware of the fact that this is Craig's final outing. It seeks to tie up the loose ends on this iteration of Bond in the most respectful ways possible. The screenplay successfully adds more depth to the character by emphasizing both his internal and external struggles. The womanizer spy is much more focused on monogamy and has difficulty trusting any of the women in his life after Madeleine. Meanwhile, he's remained off the grid and hasn't been in the field in quite some time. Bond is brought back into the spotlight that opens up old wounds and forces him to face the demons that he's been hiding from for years. The consequences could result in countless lives being lost around the world.  During Bond's time away from the field, a lot has changed. For example, Nomi (Lashana Lynch) has taken the codename ""007,' who also has the cool confidence that Bond lost years ago. Another character is brought into the fold named Paloma (Ana de Armas). Both of these ladies are absolute badasses. However, their stories aren't at the forefront. In fact, de Armas has essentially a glorified cameo that will have audiences demanding a Paloma spinoff. She delivers such immense personality and fun during her brief presence that is sure to stick with viewers. Meanwhile, Nomi gets a little bit of extra screen time, allowing the character to exhibit a small amount of growth. Some other characters reprise their roles, but make no mistake that this is Craig's journey. Everybody else is simply along for the ride.  Rami Malek stars as the antagonist. His mask gives him a creepy aesthetic, but that's the most that can be said about him. He's certainly the least interesting antagonist in Craig's Bond era. However, No Time to Die doesn't aim for this to lead to another sequel. This villain isn't meant to have a greater narrative that the audience is concerned about, so he mostly exists as a repeated plot device for Bond.  No Time to Die has a sentimental side to it. At its core, Craig's final installment tells a story about forgiveness. It's a theme that runs deep. All of the characters have been wronged to various degrees, but are now being faced with the option of forgiveness. No Time to Die concludes in a way that is totally respectful of Craig's iteration of Bond and the story he's been telling since 2006. Director Cary Joji Fukunaga does a wonderful job tying up Bond's story in a way that feels complete. The performances are stellar all around, particularly from Craig and Seydoux.  No Time to Die will likely garner awards attention for its use of sound. The action hits particularly hard with its use of audio, elevating the movie's most thrilling moments. However, it's one of the less visually eye-catching installments. Skyfall remains the most gorgeous of Craig's Bond movies. Nevertheless, No Time to Die is a theater experience through and through. It makes sense why the studio waited to release it without having to dump the big release on a streaming service. See it on the biggest, loudest screen you can safely experience it on.  No Time to Die is utterly cinematic. It's strong storytelling with big action set pieces that will leave you breathless. It's not perfect and it once again twists the Bond formula, but it's a lovely send-off for Craig. Earlier this year, Black Widow had its send-off for Scarlett Johansson, but the movie was more concerned with developing its ensemble cast for future Marvel installments. Meanwhile, No Time to Die set its sights on giving Craig's Bond era the goodbye it deserves.",AHT_Doc9_NoTimeToDie,AHT,Action,Positive,No time to die
139,AHT_Doc10_NoTimeToDie," Let the mourning begin.  In No Time to Die, James Bond is dead after 25 installments of the popular series about England fs most glamorous secret agent?which means he will never be back?in his present form.  This is also Daniel Craig fs fifth and final appearance as 007, so enjoy his previously indestructible stoicism for the last time, too.  Do this, I hasten to add, only if you are forever dedicated to a fictional action hero who, in your heart of hearts, can do no wrong.  In my opinion, he ran out of steam long ago, and now in retirement from Her Majesty fs Secret Service, he has no charm, no wit, no sex appeal, no fatal allure for women and he fs losing his hair. He dies from stray bullets, deja vu, stale dialogue and mixed reviews.  The car chases, the fight sequences (there are two), the helicopter shots, the never-ending guns and exploding warheads have all been done before.      This is probably to be expected.  You don ft go to a James Bond movie to learn anything new. You go to ogle the latest girls, gadgets and exotic locations.  The entertainment values are ever apparent, the violence and bloodshed have a certain lift that both defines and defies imagination, and who would have it any other way?  You don ft always remember what you saw the next day, but you know you had some fun.  This time the excitement fades like the popcorn that went with it, and for me, ennui comes on stealthy fingers.  No Time to Die may not be the worst James Bond movie ever made, but it fs in heavy competition as the dullest one since Octopussy.  The film fs sole distinction is the fact that it fs the James Bond epic that finally manages to make 007 a crashing bore.    Directed with more boyish slobber than narrative coherence by Cary Joji Fukunaga from an over-crammed, self-consciously contrived script by no fewer than five writers,  No Time to Die hops and stumbles all over the place, but you can still write the plot on the head of a carpet tack.  It opens with a flashback to the Italian Alps where a mysterious thug in a white mask plods through the snow to murder a young Madeleine Swann fs mother, but young Madeleine narrowly escapes.  Cut to the character, all grown up as L?a Seydoux, who may or may not be married to a gooey-eyed, lovesick 007. (The movie is very vague about things that matter.)  After some high-speed racing through the mountains in his bulletproof Aston Martin, the two lovers are set upon by agents from the evil crime syndicate SPECTRE in the town square and he dumps Madeleine, thinking she betrayed him.  It fs the end for Bond and Madeleine, but the movie is just beginning.  It helps to know your Ian Fleming history, including Bond fs relationship with Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale, as well as the meaning of SPECTRE (you got me there).  Cut to Bond trying desperately trying to enjoy his retirement in Jamaica only to reluctantly join forces with his old pal, CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) to return to action in order to stop the criminal manufacture of some kind of inexplicable poison called  gnanobots h that are injected into the bloodstream to kill the victim fs DNA, and which can spread like the COVID-19 virus and eventually destroy the world.         Soon the screen is overpopulated with tertiary characters, including Leiter fs pal Ash (Billy Magnussen) who turns out to be a double agent, kidnapped M16 scientist Valdo Obruchev (David Dencik) who invented the nanobots, a new agent named Nomi (Lashana Lynch) who has been assigned Bond fs old 007 code number, and a sexy M16 agent named Paloma (Ana de Armas) who spends her time between shootouts searching for the perfect black cocktail dress. Then there fs the great, wasted Christoph Waltz, doing his Silence of the Lambs ripoff in a padded cell in London, and master fiend Lyutsifer Safin, played obnoxiously by Rami Malek, who won an Oscar for Bohemian Rhapsody for reasons I still find baffling.  He could give lessons in hysterical overacting to Lou Costello.           Cut to an island off the coast of Japan, where Safin controls the nanobots from a Nazi bunker left over from World War II and stages an elaborate third-act battle that ends Daniel Craig fs 007 tenure with bloody knuckles and a bomb that destroys  a landscape the size of Rhode Island.  Madeleine shows up with a daughter of her own, who she declares to be James Bond fs daughter, but nothing in the movie makes any sense, so after 165 minutes of gibberish, why start asking questions now?  Something special vanished when they killed off M and Judi Dench exited with her (M is now Ralph Fiennes, who has learned to mumble) and to my eye Daniel Craig has never replaced the one and only Sean Connery.  Still, I think he deserves a better farewell party than this.  No Time to Die is more of a send-up than a send-off.",AHT_Doc10_NoTimeToDie,AHT,Action,Negative,No time to die
40,CLQ_Doc1_ItChapterTwo,"When a work you love is adapted to a new medium, it s inevitable that you ll focus on the sins of omission and elision, sins that are almost always necessary for the adaptation s existence in the first place. As I explained in Slate back in 2017 on the occasion of the release of It: Chapter One, It holds a particularly cherished position in my heart I ve reread Stephen King s magnum opus so many times since I first read it in middle school that I ve literally lost count so there was never any question that such absences were going to stand out to me. But watching It: Chapter Two, a visually inventive and at times extremely scary film that, at nearly three hours long, could have stood to omit considerably more, I couldn t help but feel like many of director Andy Muschietti and screenwriter Gary Dauberman s choices in adaptation were much worse than necessary sacrifices. They felt like grave misunderstandings, if not willful betrayals, of some of the richest parts of their source material. Like most 1,000-page, decades-spanning novels about clowns who kill children, It has long been thought to be an unfilmable work. It: Chapter One acquitted itself surprisingly well in this regard, although it did so by sailing the ol  paper boat down the road, so to speak. In adapting King s novel to the screen, Muschietti and Dauberman made two major changes to the original material. The first was disentangling the novel s two parallel timelines one about the protagonists  childhood and the other about their adulthood to make them two discrete entities presented in chronological order. (In King s novel these two sections are interwoven with one another.) The second was changing the eras in which these two sections are set. In the novel, the childhood sections take place in 1957 and  58, and the adulthood sections in 1984 and  85; in the movie, the childhood section takes place in 1988 and  89, and the adulthood section in 2016. It: Chapter One thus offered audiences the surprisingly enjoyable experience of watching an R-rated horror film starring a remarkably charismatic cast of foulmouthed adolescents, while collaterally benefiting from the rush on 1980s nostalgia prompted by the runaway success of Netflix s Stranger Things, a show that owed no small debt to King s body of work. In choosing this more linear structure, though, the filmmakers also opted to backload many of the novel s most complex and compelling aspects onto the second movie, setting themselves up for a landing more difficult to execute than the Ritual of Ch d. That It: Chapter Two struggles to completely stick that landing is no fatal failure, and in many ways confirms what those of us who love this novel have suspected all along: that It is, indeed, an unfilmable book. But what is particularly discouraging is the manner in which Chapter Two misses its marks, as the filmmakers  choices too often seem to come at the expense of the moral world of the source material.  Moral world  might seem like a strange description of a book like this, but any reader of King s knows that his best work is in fact deeply concerned with human ethics. It is a novel about many things (at that length, how could it not be), but two of its most prevalent themes are memory and abuse, in a variety of senses. Many of Pennywise s victims are those whom the town of Derry has already deemed, in a sense, disposable: They are young and vulnerable people, many of whom have been already victimized by the quotidian horror of a world that has turned away from them. As my colleague Jeffrey Bloomer wrote last week, It: Chapter Two begins with a brutal hate crime, a scene that, while directly lifted from the book, feels cheap and exploitative in the cold-open context of the movie. While the novel s depiction of this event, based on the real-life killing of Charlie Howard, now reads as dated in many ways (the book is 33 years old), the murder of Adrian Mellon is nonetheless handled with far more reflection and sensitivity in the novel. Because of the aforementioned intertwined chronologies, it occurs immediately after the murder of Georgie Denbrough in 1957, and the juxtaposition of these two events the death of a small child in the 1950s and the death of a young gay man in the 1980s quite effectively drives home the theme that these two characters, while drastically different from one another, are united in their profound vulnerability. In the film s present-day context, the scene s existence feels jarring and stunted, particularly given the film s ham-fisted treatment of sexuality in another of its subplots. Even more egregious, to me, was Chapter Two s treatment of one of the book s most important characters, Mike Hanlon, the intrepid librarian and lone black member of the Losers  Club who summons his childhood friends back to Derry. Hanlon is indispensable to the novel: For starters, significant portions of the book are narrated through his own first-person voice, the only character to whom King affords this device. But he s also, in many ways, the book s conscience, the one who s stayed in Derry and has dedicated his life to studying and attempting to grapple with the town s horrific history. In the book, Mike is the last child to join the Losers  Club, and his story is particularly heartbreaking. He is one of the few Losers who comes from a loving, stable family, and his relationship with his father is the novel s richest depiction of a parent-child dynamic. But as one of Derry s only black residents, young Mike is subjected to relentless and sometimes violent racism, particularly at the hands of Henry Bowers, the town s terrifying bully. In one of the novel s more wrenching scenes, Henry poisons the Hanlons  beloved dog, Mr. Chips, in an attempt to win the approval of his own virulently racist and abusive father, who harbors a myopic resentment towards Mike s dad for being more successful than him. Both chapters of Muschietti s It dispense with almost all of this backstory. Perhaps because the first movie is set in 1989, it makes the racism encountered by Mike far more implicit than explicit. The violent bullying he suffers is almost never explicitly racialized, and he s never assailed with racial slurs, as he frequently is in the book. In a sense this is understandable: While America in the late 1980s was far from any sort of post-racial utopia, such overt expressions of racism were far more socially stigmatized than they would have been in the 1950s. But this then leads us to a narrative problem: What specific trauma, then, has, Mike Hanlon experienced to draw him into the Losers  Club in the first place? The filmmakers   solution  to this is made disconcertingly evident in the second film. As a young child, Mike Hanlon apparently watched his parents die in a fire, and he harbors guilt over not having done enough to save them. This event is hinted at in the first film, but in oblique ways that also evoked the book s 1930 Black Spot fire, when a nightclub frequented by black soldiers was burned to the ground by the Ku Klux Klan like Maine Legion of White Decency, an event that Hanlon s father first recounts to him in 1958. It s particularly disturbing, then, when the second film reveals that Hanlon s parents were drug addicts ( crackheads,  specifically) who died in a fire that seems to have been either the direct or indirect result of their own drug use, while a young Mike is shown watching them burn alive while seated on his tricycle. It is one thing for the filmmakers, in transposing a story from the late 1950s to the late 1980s, to dial down the explicit racism a young black character faces. Social mores do indeed change. But to transform the only black protagonist from the child of responsible, nurturing parents into the child of negligent crack cocaine addicts is far worse than lazy writing; it s to actively draw from a deeply racist set of cultural tropes. In the transition from book to film, Mike Hanlon has arguably gone from a victim of racism at the hands of Henry Bowers to a victim of racism at the hands of the filmmakers. I don t think that this was done with malicious intent, but I do think it is the product of the filmmakers not knowing how to wrestle with some of the novel s most challenging but crucial material. Not unlike the town in which it s set, Muschietti s It only sees what it wants to.",CLQ_Doc1_ItChapterTwo,CLQ,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two
41,CLQ_Doc2_ItChapterTwo,"Super-sized doesn t mean super scary in  It Chapter Two,  a faithful but often plodding sequel to the 2017 smash that finishes off the story of the Losers Club and the evil clown that terrorizes them. Director Andy Muschietti crafts a handsome looking film that spends too much of its arduous, nearly three-hour running time hammering home themes that are apparent to the viewer. Yes, the scars of childhood inform who we become, and no matter how far we run from them, they continue to affect us until we face them head on. Now can we arrive there a little more quickly, please?  It Chapter Two  unfolds 27 years after the actions of the first film, and the Loser s Club is all grown up and has left Derry, Maine far in the rearview. Most are doing pretty well for themselves   Richie (Bill Hader) is now a successful stand-up comic, Bill (James McAvoy) is a Hollywood screenwriter, and Beverly has grown into, well, Jessica Chastain   but they re uniformly sick to their stomachs when they get a phone call from their old pal Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) telling them they need to return to Derry. Mike is the only one who has stayed behind in his hometown, and he has spent his days studying the patterns of Pennywise (Bill Skarsg rd), who is back to killing again after nearly 30 years spent dwelling in the sewers. Reluctantly, the gang returns, each member having buried their childhoods and memories of Pennywise in the deep recesses of their memory. (And judging by their lack of familiarity with one another, none of them bothered friending each other on Facebook over the years, either.) In his research, Mike discovered the way to beat Pennywise involves an ancient ritual, requiring each of the Losers to collect a meaningful artifact from their childhood to offer up as a sacrifice to the demon clown. Which means revisiting ugly childhood memories in Derry, where adult figures are grotesque manifestations of Americana at its worst.  It Chapter Two,  like its predecessor, lights up when the evil Pennywise is on screen, and Skarsg rd s twisted performance   especially the way he lets drool spill over his bottom lip as he stares through his soon-to-be victims and taunts them in his playfully evil clown voice   highlights the film. He s  It s  reason for being, the same way Freddy Krueger was the star attraction of the  Nightmare on Elm Street  series. (""It"" references ""Elm Street"" with several visual homages.) But unlike Freddy, Pennywise is protected; Muschietti keeps him off screen and hidden in the shadows, using him only when needed. It s the film s gift as well as its curse: Pennywise makes his time on screen count, his every laugh more sinister than the one that came before it, and he always leaves you wanting more. And there s a lot more in  It Chapter Two,  mostly with the grown-up Loser s Club gang, who often act in tandem with their younger counterparts. Muschietti sends them each on solo spiritual missions, and in so doing, overestimates the value of their individual stories; a lot of time could be saved pairing up the lesser Losers   James Ransone s Eddie, Jay Ryan s Ben   rather than letting their stories unfurl, one at a time, at such an agonizing pace.  Avengers: Endgame  did more with more characters more efficiently, and clocked in at only a few minutes longer than  It Chapter Two.  There are a lot of jokes in the film about stories with unsatisfying endings   author Stephen King even shows up in a cameo role to make a few of his own   perhaps attempting to soften the blow of  It s  protracted letdown of a finale. But acknowledging it only illuminates the issues that plague  Chapter Two  as well as its predecessor: Pennywise is a metaphor, a stand-in for childhood fears and anxieties, and a physical showdown with a symbolic being has its limitations. The way Muschietti dances around the realities of Pennywise hinder it further. Are we to take him literally? And if so, why doesn t the movie?  It  never decides which fears to take at face value and which exist only in the subconscious, and winds up confused as a result.  Chapter Two  eventually settles on its version of a happy ending, finishing King's vision for his characters. But Skarsg rd s Pennywise still has life in him beyond the source material. ""It Chapter Two"" closes the book on the Losers, but hopefully for Pennywise, it's only the beginning.",CLQ_Doc2_ItChapterTwo,CLQ,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two
42,CLQ_Doc3_ItChapterTwo,"A history of disappointment has lowered the bar for Stephen King adaptations. A few extraordinary exceptions aside, adaptations of King s work tend to range from acceptable to disastrous. Some draw on weaker material. (There s likely a ceiling on how good any film version of Thinner could be.) Others fail to explore the underlying themes of King s books in favor of scares   like either version of Pet Sematary   or get so lost in the wispier aspects of King s writing that the creators forget the appeal of a good scare or an unsettling moment. (Think back to Hearts in Atlantis, if any memory of it remains.) So when a pretty good film like 2017 s It comes along, it tends to look better just by comparison. Adapting the first half of King s ambitious 1986 novel   in which a group of Derry, Maine-based kids battle an evil entity that mostly takes the form of a clown named Pennywise   director Andy Muschietti led a talented group of child actors through a largely faithful adaptation that effectively mixed scares and sentiment. Part one of It featured a few standout setpieces, and while none topped the film-opening sewer grate encounter between a little boy and Pennywise (played with shifty malevolence by Bill Skarsgard), the winning cast worked together beautifully. The film ended on an unresolved note that set the stage for a second chapter. The second half could have been even better, as it brought in an adult cast to address the first installment s still-lingering horrors. It Chapter Two isn t that even-better film, though. It s an appreciably less-engaging film in every way, suffering from lurching storytelling, wild vacillations in tone (even within scenes), and a strong cast that never fully gels as a group. Worst of all, it substitutes excess for suspense in a long middle section that finds one character after another having interchangeable encounters with Pennywise in which the self-proclaimed  eater of worlds  never appears to be a real threat. Sure, he munches on a few minor characters, but the main cast appears to be off-limits. At worst, he seems like an eater of child actors and other characters who are much lower on the call sheet than the leads. The film opens with a flashback featuring the cast of the original film (most of them noticeably de-aged via digital effects), the first of many such moments. Screenwriter Gary Dauberman (Annabelle, The Nun) has a hard time staying true to the  Chapter Two  portion of the title. He repeatedly returns to the summer of 1989 to flesh out the backstories of the now-middle-aged friends who call themselves the Losers  Club. Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) has remained behind in Derry, keeping a watchful eye for their enemy s return while setting up house in the attic of the town library. Others have scattered to the four winds, including Bill (James McAvoy), now a successful novelist; Richie (Bill Hader), who s spun his talent for wisecracks into a career as a self-loathing stand-up comic; and Beverly (Jessica Chastain), now a successful fashion designer whose abusive marriage echoes her relationship with her father. She isn t alone in directly translating her childhood into adulthood. Eddie (James Ransone) has traded a worry-paralyzed mother for a similarly inclined wife. The film does little to flesh out the psychological shorthand of King s novel, in which grown-ups blindly reenact the trauma of their childhoods, but at least Bev and Eddie feel connected to the past. Ben (Jay Ryan) has grown from a soulful overweight kid to a dull hunk of a man who seems to have little in common with his former self beyond carrying a torch for Beverly. When the killings fire up in Derry again, Mike summons his old friends back home, and they respond to the call, even though they only have vague memories of what happened to them in the summer of  89. They barely remember each other or Mike. That changes upon arrival when the past starts to come back to them, first in ripples, then in waves. Pennywise starts to make his presence felt almost immediately. At the same time, the movie starts to trip over itself. Charged by Mike with finding tokens from the past they can use in their fight against Pennywise, each character wanders Derry and experiences both a flashback to their younger selves and an encounter with Pennywise. Some of these scenes work, like Bev s return to her childhood apartment. (Most of that scene was released as a teaser trailer.) Some sequences don t gel, like Richie s middle-of-the-day encounter with a murderous Paul Bunyan statue, the most insubstantial CG effect in a film crawling with them   sometimes literally. But none of these face-offs push the plot forward or reveal much about the characters, in spite of some strong performances, particularly from Chastain and Hader. That s particularly frustrating when those performances do hit their stride during the individual scenes that do push the story forward. The many scenes featuring the child cast of the first film feel extraneous. But they also don t do the adult cast any favors because they remind viewers of the children s chemistry, which their elders never find together. That mismatch might have worked if Muschietti had tied it to the obvious themes the film could have explored, like how adulthood keeps people anchored to what shaped us as kids while pushing us away from the companionship and freedom that made childhood tolerable. But where It had a lot to say about what it feels like to be a 13-year-old outcast who takes solace in friendship, It Chapter Two struggles to express much about middle age, its disappointments, or its compensations. All that might not have mattered nearly as much if the film was scarier. Skarsgard has some chilling moments, but when he isn t on-screen, It Chapter Two struggles to remain unsettling as its protagonists stumble down one reality-warped version of Derry after another before escaping back to reality   if  escape  is even the right word. (The film nods to one obvious inspiration by featuring a marquee for A Nightmare on Elm Street 5, and while it s much better than that movie, even in that weak entry, Freddy Krueger seemed capable of harm.) Maybe that s why It Chapter Two keeps undercutting its creepiness with gags and one-liners that often feel wildly out of place, even when being delivered by a pro like Hader. One running gag does work, however. As an author of Stephen King-esque best-sellers, Bill keeps encountering people who are all too eager to mock his books  lousy endings, a complaint often leveled at King s novels as well. It s too bad acknowledging a problem isn t the same as solving it. But while It Chapter Two brings the story to an unsatisfying close, the It movies taken as a whole deserve credit for their ambition and for trying to capture one of King s best books in full. It Chapter Two never really depicts the way dewy sentimentality can curdle into pain and regret or considers whether the other side of middle age offers a way of letting go of the past. Its monster only occasionally embodies the otherworldly fearfulness that leads the characters to speak of it in hushed tones. But at least Muschietti is trying for something epic and intimidating, a story on a grand scale instead of the kind of minor, just-good-enough storytelling that s marked so many King adaptations. His work gets points for thoughtfulness and effort. But while his films are better than a lot of King adaptations, the way they often seem this close to reaching greatness without getting there ultimately makes them more frustrating than films made by people who are trying half as hard and settling for something half as good.",CLQ_Doc3_ItChapterTwo,CLQ,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two
43,CLQ_Doc4_ItChapterTwo,"Memory is as much shaped by who we are as who we yearn to be. What we live isn t so easily catalogued; it mutates, skitters, and fades in the face of the prevailing story we dictate about who we imagine ourselves to be. But what happens when memories long forgotten and inescapable come to the forefront? Who do we become then? It s this emotional bramble of yearning and personal storytelling that is the engine of director Andy Muschietti s It Chapter Two. The film s focus on memory sometimes works to its advantage, reminding us in plentiful flashbacks that what illuminated and elevated its predecessor was the tender, sparkling chemistry of its young cast. The film draws a distinct line from the hurts of the characters  younger selves to the wounds they carry as adults 27 years later when the film picks up. They drop their respective lives in order to return to Derry and finish the battle that they started long ago at the urging of a desperate Mike (Isaiah Mustafa), the only member of the Loser s Club to stay in their hometown, eventually becoming the town librarian who has given his life over to obsession. But each of them is bruised in their own fashion. Ben (Jay Ryan) has shed his weight and become a successful architect still haunted by the bullying of his past. (He carries around a yearbook page as if its signature is the only act of kindness he s ever received.) Eddie (James Ransone) is a terrifyingly high-strung adult. Bill (James McAvoy) has found success as a novelist but can t seem to pull off an ending   his introduction on a film set includes a Peter Bogdonavich cameo, of all things   and remains shadowed by the loss of his younger brother, Georgie. Richie (Bill Hader) is a standup comedian and barely functioning alcoholic. Beverly (Jessica Chastain) is in a brutally abusive marriage, revealed in an increasingly uncomfortable scene that is never properly addressed again. That s the thing: It Chapter Two moves with an almost too swift purpose, never feeling the weight of its nearly three-hour runtime; although it is long, the film feels frustratingly thin. Meanwhile, the film is aggressively sentimental, and moments of emotional catharsis or terror don t often hit the way they need to. When they do, it is because of the dedication of the acting. Most galling in It Chapter Two is its uneven application of horror. (All this despite an unfurling of horror references onscreen, including a sequence that takes a page from The Thing.) The various ghouls that besiege the grown-up Loser s Club, all visions of Pennywise, are silly, textureless creations. With them, suspense is in short supply. Their scares are more gross than chilling, leaving little impact once they re out of sight. Perhaps the greatest failure in this regard is how criminally it wastes Pennywise himself, although Bill Skarsg rd s gusto is appreciated. Pennywise flutters in and out of the film with his glowing eyes and drooling maw, fizzling into a palid ending. Ultimately, Muschietti and writer Gary Dauberman can t make the variety of tones and styles feel cohesive. It Chapter Two swerves from carnival-based horror to fantasy to romance to nostalgia trip and back again, sometimes within the span of a single scene, thickly layering on comedy from Hader that surely delights in some moments but often diffuses the tension the film sorely needs. The most troublesome example of the film s tonal confusion is its opening scene, which details a vicious, unflinching hate crime against a gay couple (played by Taylor Frey and actor/director Xavier Dolan) that dovetails into the fantastical when Pennywise s amber-glowing eyes cut through the darkness. It s a transition that didn t sit well with me, especially when it became clear it wouldn t be unpacked later. By the time the voiceover monologue that bookends the film returns, replete with swelling music to pluck at your heartstrings, the nostalgia feels pockmarked. Part of the problem lies in the fact that the movie separates the cast, led by Hader and Chastain as embodiments of melancholy, for long stretches, forgetting that its best sequences allow the Losers  Club members to play off one another, hiding their fear with jokes or downturned glances. Here, no amount of hiding or running away leads any of our characters to fully escape the memories that shape them and make them whole. The grown-up members of the Loser s Club stumble through the horrors of memory with anxious zeal and sometimes frantic humor, but the film needed to dig deeper. It needed to thread the horror and tension more expertly for such a journey to stay in the mind of the viewer.",CLQ_Doc4_ItChapterTwo,CLQ,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two
44,CLQ_Doc5_ItChapterTwo,"The heroes of  It  are known as the Losers Club.  It Chapter Two  features the same group of talented young actors as the original 2017 film, and also adds older versions of these characters, who are in their 40s. Director Andy Muschietti attempts to honor everyone involved, including Stephen King, author of the 1986 novel  It,  so the movie is like a game of musical chairs that runs too long. And since Muschietti has few scare tactics at his disposal, the film loses its capacity to frighten. You will recall that  It  had the Losers Club defeat Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), a demonic spirit that can take many forms but prefers that of a demented clown. Twenty-seven years pass   this film is set in 2016   and only Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) remembers what happened. Like a bad nightmare, the rest of them barely recall that period in their young lives. Now that Pennywise is on the prowl again, hunting children and other vulnerable people, Mike contacts the rest of the Losers and asks them to return to Derry, Maine. Only together can they defeat Pennywise once and for all. At first, Muschietti successfully taps into the novelty of older actors playing adult versions of child characters. James Ransone plays the older version of Eddie, the hypochondriac motormouth, and he finds heartbreaking notes of paralyzing fear. Bill Hader leaves a strong impression as Richie, the bespectacled comic relief whose need to tell jokes is almost a crutch. Mike asks the Losers to venture out alone, effectively reacquainting them with the events of that fateful summer and reliving past traumas. Once the Losers separate in Derry,  Chapter Two  grinds to a halt. This sequence is essentially an opportunity for every actor, both young and old, to interact with some version of Pennywise. Once again Muschietti relies on jump scares and unsettling imagery, techniques that are, admittedly, effective. But after yet another Loser experiences an ultra-vivid hallucination, we get the point. At nearly three hours long, the need to resolve every subplot creates a gnawing sense of impatience. Screenwriter Gary Dauberman includes meta-jokes about how King never quite knows how to nail an ending, but that common criticism exists for a reason. Monsters and giant clowns are not the only thing that make the film disturbing.  Chapter Two  opens with a violent hate crime, and adult Beverly (Jessica Chastain) deals with brutal domestic abuse. Maybe these scenes are meant to show this is a more  mature  horror film, except Muschietti does not deal with their ramifications in a sensitive or dramatically consistent way. Real trauma is given the same consideration as a literal funhouse of horrors, which cheapens what the characters and audience are put through. The first  It  was such a commercial and critical success because it was essentially a coming-of-age film with some scary bits thrown in. Moreover, Muschietti used the first battle against Pennywise as a metaphor for self-reliance and the loss of innocence. Now that the characters are older, there are fewer lessons for them to learn, so  Chapter Two  regresses them into a childlike state. Romantic subplots are indelicate, and shared grief arrives with less trauma. The cumulative effect is downright maudlin, which is not what you might expect from a film with gallons of blood and other bodily fluids.",CLQ_Doc5_ItChapterTwo,CLQ,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two
45,CLQ_Doc6_ItChapterTwo,"It Chapter Two"" gave me ""Avengers: Endgame"" flashbacks. This is both a good thing and a bad thing. On the plus side, each movie completes multiple character arcs in more or less satisfying ways, understanding that for all of the expensive special effects being displayed on screen, the main quality that makes or breaks a film is whether or not we care about the protagonists. Each one also has an iconic villain at the center of its story, although the baddie in ""It Chapter Two"" is horrifying, while Thanos of the MCU is intended to be more of an intimidating ""final boss"" archetype. Finally each movie, despite the roughly three-hour running time, feels lean; neither drags or feels padded out, but keeps moving along at a brisk clip. On the less flattering side: Each movie works better on an emotional level than a logical one. Picking up where 2017's ""It"" left off, ""Chapter Two""   again directed by Andy Muschietti   tells the story of seven adults who have suppressed traumatic memories from their childhoods in the fictional town of Derry, Maine. They are of course forced to confront them when an evil supernatural clown threatens to murder innocent people. As readers of King's novel will know, the cast of characters is extensive. It includes Bill (James McAvoy), a successful writer who had to overcome a debilitating stutter as a child; Richie (Bill Hader), a stand-up comedian whose vulgarity is revealed to be motivated by a secret character trait that serves as one of the film's plot twists (and one of the most notable deviations from previous tellings); Beverly (Jessica Chastain), a fashion designer who was physically and sexually abused by her father; Eddie (James Ransone), a risk assessor who suffers from hypochondria and had an overbearing mother; Ben (Jay Ryan), a wealthy architect who used to be obese; Mike (Isaiah Mustafa), the town librarian whose family suffered from drug abuse and still struggles with it himself; and Stanley (Andy Bean), who was frightened and weak as a child and is much the same as an adult. Not surprisingly, a movie that has to juggle so many plot threads at once   and that's not including the violent bully Henry (Teach Grant), who went to prison after murdering his father in the first movie   will wind up shortchanging a few of them. The big twist about Richie feels underdeveloped, which is a shame given Hader's strong dramatic performance, and the movie's attempts to tie into larger social issues comes across as forced, if well-intentioned. Likewise the movie's attempt to elevate a crucial choice made by Stanley early in the story into something more noble falls flat. In  both King's 1986 novel and the 1990 television film, that aspect of Stanley's character felt like a lazy anti-Semitic stereotype. Here it's more respectable, but only makes sense if Stanley knew things that, in plot terms, only another character could possibly have known. These aren't the only story glitches in ""It Chapter Two,"" which too often falls into the horror-movie trap of characters who do things no one with a functioning sense of self-preservation instinct would actually do. Muschietti also relies on jump scares on too many occasions, which feels unnecessary given how much creative energy was spent on developing genuinely grotesque and horrifying visuals. Finally there are a number of moments when Pennywise the evil clown could easily dispatch important characters and doesn't, simply because if he did, the movie would be over. Where the parallels between ""It Chapter Two"" and ""Avengers: Endgame"" are positive: When it comes to the main qualities genre fans will want, it definitely delivers. Just as ""Endgame"" had the superheroics mainstream audiences crave in blockbuster cinema, ""It Chapter Two"" absolutely brings the scares. Its peak moments rank among the most frightening seen in mainstream movies in recent memory, right up there with other 2019 horror hits like Jordan Peele's ""Us"" and Ari Aster's ""Midsommar."" Just as important, Muschietti and screenwriter Gary Dauberman (adapting King's book) make the story feel like an epic payoff to years and years of character development, a feat that is particularly impressive when you consider that ""It Chapter Two"" only follows up one movie and ""Avengers: Endgame"" had 21 previous films to work off of. Considerable credit must go to the cast, particularly Bill Skarsg rd who once again takes the role of Pennywise the Dancing Clown and makes him into a presence both over-the-top in his campiness and yet weirdly haunting long after the credits have rolled. Skarsg rd does for Pennywise what Heath Ledger did for The Joker in ""The Dark Knight,"" taking a character that had been previously played for camp (by Tim Curry in the ""It"" TV movie, and Jack Nicholson in Tim Burton's 1989 ""Batman,"" respectively) and going into meaner, darker places without completely losing touch with earlier versions. This Pennywise, although menacing, also at times comes across as a frightened, vulnerable child. There is human complexity to this transdimensional being that likes to toy with its prey, a sense that there is a personality with issues beneath the one-liners and horror villain tropes. The child cast also deserves accolades here. As in the first movie, Finn Wolfhard, Jaeden Martell, Jeremy Ray Taylor, Sophia Lillis, Jack Dylan Grazer, Wyatt Oleff and Chosen Jacobs are all outstanding   and they need to be, given that their deep friendship provides the movie with its emotional core. (Nicholas Hamilton is also outstanding as the child version of the psychopathic Henry.) The story also uses the horrors of Derry as an allegory for the various forms of childhood trauma, especially the way we both repress scarring memories and are nevertheless shaped by them as adults. Overall, ""It Chapter Two"" is a fitting companion piece to the first film. There are flaws, to be sure, but nothing you wouldn't expect going in. If you liked ""It,"" then you definitely won't be disappointed. If you didn't, why are you even here in the first place?",CLQ_Doc6_ItChapterTwo,CLQ,Horror,Positive,It Chapter Two
46,CLQ_Doc7_ItChapterTwo,"Multiple  wow  moments permeate the landscape of  It Chapter Two  like so many ominous, red balloons floating across a New England summer sky. Some will make you say  wow  for the sheer daring of their surrealism and the startlingly graphic nature of their execution. Others will make you say  wow  because they really do not work. Either way, director Andy Muschietti has absolutely gone for it with the sequel to his 2017 smash Stephen King adaptation, taking big swings and displaying both a muscularity and an elegance to his craft. And given that his film stretches nearly three hours, he gets more than ample opportunity to show off all those tools.  It Chapter Two  can be a sprawling, unwieldy mess overlong, overstuffed and full of frustrating detours but its casting is so spot-on, its actors have such great chemistry and its monster effects are so deliriously ghoulish that the film keeps you hooked. You won t check out entirely, but you will check your watch several times. In adapting the second part of King s nearly 1,200-page tome, returning writer Gary Dauberman is in a tricky spot: What to keep? What to cut? He does a bit of both while also incorporating moments from the first film as well as new scenes featuring the characters as kids to fill in some gaps. As in the original,  It Chapter Two  works best when the members of the self-proclaimed Losers Club are bouncing off each other, their banter infused with a sparkling mix of hormones, humor, insecurity and camaraderie. Unfortunately, Muschietti and Dauberman spend a lot of their time keeping their perfectly picked actors apart on individual adventures, which drags out the drama and slows down the momentum. Just as the ending of the first film foreshadowed, though, the kids who escaped the villainous grasp of the evil clown Pennywise during the summer of 1989 have found themselves back in Derry, Maine right on cue, 27 years later, to fight him again. They d all gone their separate ways and carved out vastly different lives, and in introducing us to these characters as adults, Muschietti makes some gorgeous transitions that are smooth and inventive. But returning to their seemingly idyllic small town instantly revives their old rhythms and relationships. Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa as an adult, Chosen Jacobs as a child) is the only one of the bunch who stayed in Derry; he s the self-styled historian and the one who makes the fateful phone calls to round up his old pals when Pennywise resurfaces. Bill (James McAvoy/Jaeden Martell) has gone on to become a novelist whose latest book is being adapted into a film, one of several meta bits scattered throughout. Beverly (Jessica Chastain/Sophia Lillis), who endured a controlling, abusive relationship with her father, is now in a controlling, abusive relationship with her husband. Richie (Bill Hader/Finn Wolfhard) is a hard-drinking, trash-talking stand-up comic who s as acerbic as ever. (Hader s performance is the highlight within this terrific ensemble as he shows off his perfect comic timing as well as his deep dramatic chops.) Eddie (James Ransone/Jack Dylan Grazer) remains a neurotic hypochondriac who s married to a woman who looks and sounds an awful lot like his smothering mother. And Ben (Jay Ryan/Jeremy Ray Taylor), who was both the poet and the brains of the group, shed his baby fat and transformed himself into a hunky, wealthy architect. Other than that, his defining character trait is the secret crush he still has on Beverly nearly three decades later; it grows a bit tedious. Perhaps the best scene in the whole film is the one in which they all reconnect for the first time over a boisterous, boozy dinner at a Chinese restaurant. They spin the lazy Susan, down shots of liquor, tease each other mercilessly and find it s as if no time at all has passed even though the memories of the trauma they shared are hazy at best.  It Chapter Two  is at its strongest when it explores the lure of nostalgia, not merely through pop culture references like  The Lost Boys  and Cameo s  Word Up,  but also in the cosmic way it can yank you right back to being the person you were long ago and never thought you d be again. That unsure, evolving 13-year-old remains inside all of us, no matter where we go or what we do. Pennywise, however, has stayed the same all this time and Bill Skarsg rd s deeply creepy presence is sorely missed when he s off screen. With a performance that s as physical as it is verbal, he consistently manages to find that sweet spot between being terrifying and hilarious. He s created an iconic horror villain for the ages. But the rules seem to be ever changing as to what Pennywise can achieve with his supernatural abilities. He knows what scares these characters, even as adults, which often manifests itself in strange, vivid ways. It s the stuff of nightmares, even when they re wide awake in broad daylight. But his omniscience and omnipresence tend to vacillate, and the collaborative power that ultimately challenges him isn t too different from what we saw in the climax of the first movie. First, though, the members of the Losers Club must spread out across town and find totems from their youth as part of a ritual to purge Pennywise from existence; they do it at Mike s insistence, part of the Native American subplot that also exists in the source material. It s absurd and it s a distraction; excising this element of the story would have made the film as a whole leaner and stronger. But while separating the characters significantly lengthens the running time, it also results in individual moments of insane terror, most notably the expertly staged and paced scene in which Beverly revisits her childhood apartment. What she finds there is one of those  wow  moments you ll laugh out loud in hopes of alleviating some of the excruciating suspense. Eventually, though, you ll also come to realize that Pennywise gets a little repetitive with the frights he inflicts upon his victims. They re of a few varieties: They re staggering, slurping zombies, or they re somehow spider-related, or they involve gallons of water or blood. (Henry Bowers [Teach Grant/Nicholas Hamilton], the mulleted bully from the first film, also returns to do his cruel bidding in a way that feels contrived and superfluous.) But as  It Chapter Two  shows us, not only can you go home again you sorta have to.",CLQ_Doc7_ItChapterTwo,CLQ,Horror,Positive,It Chapter Two
47,CLQ_Doc8_ItChapterTwo,"Stephen King took 1,138 pages to tell the story of  It,  his 1986 horror classic about an evil clown called Pennywise who torments a group of children in Maine. But director Andy Muschietti always seems pressed for time, both in his 2017 adaptation of the first quarter or so of  It  and now in this far more expansive sequel, which runs nearly three hours.  It Chapter Two  is a much grander project than the first film, for it encompasses the main characters as both children and adults. The main problem with the initial movie was that Bill Skarsg rd s Pennywise was too much a special effect and too little a taunting and evil human in clown makeup, but in  It Chapter Two,  Skarsg rd is allowed to make much more of a contribution. The second half of the 1990 TV miniseries of  It,  which dealt with the child characters as adults, was much weaker than the first;  It Chapter Two  is stronger than its predecessor, partly because the adult actors give it so much emotional intensity, particularly James McAvoy as the grown-up Bill Denbrough and Jessica Chastain as the adult Beverly. It is also more impressive because Muschietti focuses more on intimate psychological horror and less on spectacle. Some very upsetting things happen in the first hour of  It Chapter Two,  none more so than the brutal gay-bashing and murder of the defiant Adrian Mellon (Xavier Dolan), which King based on the real-life hate-crime murder of Charlie Howard in Bangor, Maine, in 1984. Muschietti does not soft-pedal this sequence in any way, and he does not allow us to look away from the very abusive relationship in which Chastain s adult Beverly finds herself. King s  It  takes the conception of evil very seriously and follows it to the most primal conclusions. Pennywise is strong because he lives on the fear of his victims, and he plays on weaknesses without mercy, like the worst kind of bully. The evil of Pennywise is linked to the evil of the homophobic gay bashers and of Beverly s violent husband, but this is never simplistic. Dolan s Mellon is not at all afraid of the bigots who kill him, while Beverly is not so much afraid of her husband as numb to him. Probably the best and the scariest sequence in  It Chapter Two  is also one of the simplest. Chastain s Beverly goes back to her childhood home, where she is greeted by an elderly woman named Mrs. Kersh (Joan Gregson) who insists on inviting Beverly in for tea. Beverly looks around a bit, and when she sits down for the tea, Mrs. Kersh s face seems to freeze slightly, as if she has begun to somehow malfunction. Muschietti seems to have realized that what Gregson is able to do with her face here, as a performer, is much more frightening than anything he might be able to do with a special effect. And this realization extends to what happens next, when Beverly finds herself trapped in a hallway with Skarsg rd s Pennywise sitting down at the end of it. Pennywise is without his usual makeup, and he wears her father s clothes and hair. He becomes Beverly s abusive father here and speaks to her as her father until he starts to put on his clown make-up, and this is far more frightening as a visual idea than all of the other set pieces in this movie involving very elaborate and expensive-looking effects of insects with human faces and large statues that come to life. What stands out in  It Chapter Two  is not the clearly labored-over insect effects but that moment with Mrs. Kersh and the scene of Pennywise as Beverly s father   both reliant on actors rather than technical wizardry. The human eye can tell that there is not much in effects but effects themselves with a story like this about evil. But an actor like Gregson or Skarsg rd can channel evil for us because they are human, and so therefore are presumably familiar with evil and can show it under controlled conditions to an audience. The strength of the King material is that it is without sentimentality; any bit of happiness here has to be earned through suffering and sometimes with wrenching sacrifice. King himself appears in  It Chapter Two  as a shop owner. He looks skinny, slightly stunned, harsh and un-smiling, a master of the macabre, and likely pleased with the success of these new  It  movies, financially and otherwise. If Muschietti s achievement with these two features is one more of managerial smarts and problem-solving than anything else, still his skill and control is welcome. And surely Muschietti s  It  and  It Chapter Two  will both play better when seen together with added footage for the streaming release of his director s cuts, when he won t have to worry so much about running times.",CLQ_Doc8_ItChapterTwo,CLQ,Horror,Positive,It Chapter Two
48,CLQ_Doc9_ItChapterTwo,"Why isn t Pennywise the clown as terrifying in  It Chapter Two  as he was in the first half of this story? Maybe it s because when Pennywise bares his teeth and zeroes in on a potential victim, it s easier to feel empathy when the potential victim is a kid from  Stranger Things  and not Bill Hader. And I love Bill Hader. Don t get me wrong: there s still a lot of life (and death) left in the creepy-ass entity with the light-bulb-shaped head. There s no shortage of jump-from-your-seat GOTCHA! moments in director Andy Muschietti s sequel to his 2017 horror insta-classic (both movies based on the 1986 Stephen King novel, of course). Yet for all of Muschietti s visual flourishes and with the greatly talented Bill Skarsgard again delivering a madcap, disturbingly effective, all-in performance as the dreaded Pennywise,  It: Chapter Two  had a relatively muted impact on me. This time around, the main storyline takes place when our beloved  Losers  Club  are no longer kids   they re a bunch of 40ish, neurotic, wisecracking, self-aware adults. Even as they re fighting for their survival, they can t help but acknowledge how there s something inherently ludicrous about them facing off against a clown most people can t see. Still, this is a solid, extremely well-crafted, great-looking and occasionally quite chilling film, with terrific performances by the grown-ups as well as the returning kids. After a brutal and nasty (and narratively unnecessary) prologue, we catch up with the various members of the Losers  Club some 27 years after the events of the first film. Let s take a look at your opening day roster: James McAvoy is Bill, the former leader of the Losers  Club, who has become a best-selling mystery novelist   although readers (including his wife) are always telling him he doesn t know how to end a story. (Jaeden Martell returns as young Bill.) Jessica Chastain is Beverly, who was abused by her father and was the subject of hateful rumors at school. Beverly has become a successful fashion designer but has been trapped in a horrific marriage with an abusive husband. (Sophia Lillis is young Beverly.) Bill Hader as the foul-mouthed smart-aleck Richie, who has put his talents to good use as a popular stand-up comic. (Finn Wolfhard is little Richie.) Jay Ryan is the formerly overweight, picked-on Ben, who has become a hunky architect.(Jeremy Ray Taylor is younger Ben.) James Ransone is the hypochondriac Eddie (with Jack Dylan Grazer as young Eddie); Andy Bean is the reluctant Losers  Club member Stanley (Wyatt Oleff is 27-years-ago Stanley); and Isaiah Mustafa is Mike Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs in the flashback scenes), the only member of the Losers to stay in Derry. Convinced Pennywise is back, Mike calls the Losers, who have scattered far and wide, and reminds them of the blood oath they swore more than a quarter-century ago: If the clown of their childhood nightmares resurfaced, they would return to Derry to kill it. Weirdly, Mike seems to be the only one who even recalls what happened when they were kids. The rest barely even remember each other, let alone any of the details of their epic battle against the supernatural clown. That changes when they come home to Derry, and the memories grow ever more clear. The grown-up losers are quickly reminded of Pennywise s powerful abilities to get inside their heads when a laugh-filled reunion dinner at a Chinese restaurant turns super-gross (and kinda funny). This scene sets the tone for a series of separate set-pieces in which adult Beverly, Bill, Richie, et al., individually experience moments of absolute terror, all courtesy of Pennywise s handiwork. An impromptu knock on the door of a former childhood home, a stop in the town square where a kitschy statue looms large against the sky, the sighting of one s beloved childhood bicycle in a store window   each scene begins relatively innocently before exploding into a waking nightmare that preys on the worst fears and repressed memories of each of the Losers. All good stuff, but more often than not, director Muschietti and the first-rate special effects team deliver gross-out visuals in favor of truly chilling and tense psychological terror. I mean, the Losers have to deal with a LOT of arachnid-inspired imagery. (The scariest scene in the entire 2 hour, 49 minute film is a stand-alone interlude in which a little girl with a birthmark on her face encounters Pennywise under the bleachers at a baseball game, and feels for him because he says he, too, knows what it s like to look different.) Chastain as Beverly, Hader as Richie and Mustafa as Mike create the most effective and authentic grown-up versions of the childhood characters. (This is not a knock on the other adult actors; they just feel less  connected  to the younger versions of themselves.) The production design is rich with detail and wonderfully forbidding. The cinematography conveys a deep and dark sense of doom   even in the bright of day, even when there s a parade or a carnival and everyone seems to be having such a wonderful time. Even as the second-best chapter in a two-part horror epic, this is a movie with enough scare power to tap you on your subconscious just before you fall asleep tonight.",CLQ_Doc9_ItChapterTwo,CLQ,Horror,Positive,It Chapter Two
49,CLQ_Doc10_ItChapterTwo,"There are things far more horrific than evil, shape-shifting sewer clowns in  It Chapter Two,  the bruising conclusion to the 2017 Warner Bros. hit that brings the now-adult heroes home to face their ultimate fears. That ancient, festering evil still lurks in Derry, Maine, where seven misfit friends dubbed the  Losers Club  were terrorized as kids one summer by Pennywise the Clown, the monstrous Stephen King creation who s fueled nightmares since the 1986 publication of  It  and the 1990 miniseries of the same name. Pennywise returns with new tricks, sharper teeth and a hankering for revenge in the sequel opening Sept. 6 and directed again by Andy Muschietti ( Mama ) from a script by Gary Dauberman that attempts more plot than it can handle. Still, it s the internalized and human terrors that pack the most stomach-churning frights in  It Chapter Two.  After focusing the first film on its 13-year-old heroes circa 1989,  It Chapter Two  adopts the mournful perspective of wistful adulthood, catching up with the estranged and now-grown Losers Club as they reunite 27 years later to honor the blood oath they made as adolescents. We learn that the tightknit bunch grew up fast after facing off against Pennywise that fateful summer. But they drifted apart, their memories of their childhood boogeyman and of one another fading the farther away they moved from Derry. Now 40-somethings still plagued by their lingering childhood demons, the once forever friends are strangers harboring deep emotional wounds that never healed. Bill Denbrough (James McAvoy) kept the stutter, became a horror novelist and married Audra (a briefly seen Jess Weixler), the actress starring in his latest book-to-screen adaptation. Beverly Marsh (Jessica Chastain) is a designer whose outward appearance masks a viciously abusive marriage. Richie Tozier (Bill Hader) has parlayed his defensive penchant for cracking jokes into a career in   what else?   stand-up comedy, a detail so perfect it single-handedly justifies the more contemporary shift in time from the 1950s- and  80s-set novel. Ben Hanscom (Jay Ryan) slimmed down and became a renowned but lonely architect, and hypochondriac Eddie Kaspbrak (James Ransone) married a woman nearly as overbearing as his late mother. Only Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa), the lone Loser who stayed behind in Derry, retains memories of their ordeal. As town librarian, he s haunted and consumed by it too, and has dedicated his life to keeping watch for Pennywise s return. When unspeakable crimes and those creepy red balloons start reappearing across Derry, Mike calls the gang home to fulfill their childhood promise. Only one, the meticulously ordered accountant Stanley Uris (Andy Bean), chooses to defy their fate, the consequence of which hangs a somber cloud over the waking nightmares that ensue. By selectively whittling down the novel s interwoven time lines and characters,  It Chapter Two  refocuses its telling of King s 1,100-plus-page bestseller into not just a scary clown movie   which it also is, thanks to Bill Skarsg rd s demented return as the trans-dimensional titular monster   but an elegy of memory, trauma and healing, minus the more extreme and controversial elements of the novel. Muschietti nevertheless strains to weave the journeys of his seven characters across two time lines while cramming a convoluted surplus of plot into one saga-ending sequel. The charismatic younger  It  cast and their foul-mouthed  Stranger Things  vibe return via flashbacks, aided by de-aging VFX, as the film hopscotches between the present and the past. Stunningly conceived subterranean depths provide expansive fantasyscapes as the Losers tangle with Pennywise across small town Derry, far beneath the sewers where he once lured little Georgie Denbrough with his toy boat, and into their own pasts. The film s design tips its hat to inspiration ranging from 1987 s  The Lost Boys  to 18th century Italian artist Giovanni Battista Piranesi. Around every corner are fantastical creepy-crawlies, giant statues come to life and gruesome jump-scares, even if too many of the hallucinatory thrills of  It Chapter Two  land more like toothless fascinations instead of bone-chilling scares. Cinematographer Checco Varese excels in lensing Pennywise s nightmarish interludes with a gorgeous, surreal and inviting texture. But save for a few clever moments that illustrate how Pennywise has sharpened his hunting skills during his 27-year hibernation, the rules of the world and of his powers go undefined. His torments often lead nowhere, blunting the sense of menace that Skarsg rd brings to the role of the sadistic, child-chomping monster clown. As its two hours, 49-minute run time marches on,  It Chapter Two  loses sight of the forest for the trees, even with Benjamin Wallfisch s portentous score signaling the way. A particularly unwieldy and overstuffed third act lacks the elegance and dexterity that Muschietti builds into his best individual sequences. As a result, several of the characters  psychological journeys feel abbreviated into repetitive, bite-sized vignettes in the rush to get to the end. In doing so, at least, it traverses gutting emotional terrain, saved by an excellent cast led by McAvoy, versatile standout Hader, comedically gifted Ransone, and Jessica Chastain, who starred in Muschietti s 2013 debut,  Mama.  Here she s fierce and vulnerable in equal measure, whether confronting the memory of her abusive father or nearly drowning in a nightmarish bathroom stall filled to the ceiling with viscous blood. Like most studio horror films of a certain sheen,  It Chapter Two  is not gory so much as it is playfully macabre, a choice that dulls the scares just enough to appeal to a broad audience. But Dauberman s screenplay lands best when it speaks a more emotional dialect of horror, an adults-in-therapy horror   the kind that will land with a sting of recognition for anyone who s seen their own childhood wounds crash head-on into the realities of middle age. Muschietti is certainly a gifted visualist, lending poignancy to an engaging first act with dreamlike segues that pierce the metaphysical veil and tighten the cosmic tapestry that unites the Losers. The film s opening prologue, a post-carnival hate crime taken from the pages of King s novel, is at once its most brutal and achingly enacted, and features Canadian auteur Xavier Dolan in one of several surprising filmmaker cameos that should thrill certain cinephiles. Arguably its most successful scene is one in which Bev visits her old apartment and, against better judgment, accepts the current tenant s invitation for a cup of tea. What ensues unfolds with a crackling sense of timing, playing the audience like Pennywise pulling the puppet strings on his prey, it s no wonder it s been used to death in the marketing campaign. You only wish the entirety of  It Chapter Two  pulsated with that kind of intimate and delicious dread.",CLQ_Doc10_ItChapterTwo,CLQ,Horror,Positive,It Chapter Two
70,ASI_Doc1_Taken,"Genre films are beginning to creep back into theaters after the big parade of Oscar-contenders praise be to God and one of them, a little actioner called Taken, is now tops at the box-office and deserves a quick hosanna. (Not that the Oscar nominees aren t an exciting topic too. Oh golly no. I ve been meaning to write all about them and somehow just haven t gotten around to it. After all, what could be more riveting than making a case for which heart-tugging spectacle should win Best Picture, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button or Slumdog Millionaire? Or wondering whether Meryl Streep even has room in her bathroom for another Oscar? Stars all keep their awards in their bathrooms, see, to show how joshy and down-to-earth they are! It s fascinating!) Taken is a short, punchy B-movie, countering the ever-longer and more brooding big-budget action spectacles we ve been seeing for a while now (the Bournes, the Bonds, the Batmans). Luc Besson, best known for directing La Femme Nikita, The Professional, and The Fifth Element, is producer and co-screenwriter here (with frequent collaborator Robert Mark Kamen), and through his company Europacorp he s grinding out consistently lively B-action fare like the Transporter series, assorted Jett Li movies, etc. Besson and director Pierre Morel last gave us the eye-popper 2004 action-fan-fave District B13. Their new one, Taken, is an old-fashioned vigilante film about a father rescuing his daughter from sex slavers who will, naturally, die in droves. The formula is freshened up with some unlikely casting: Liam Neeson as the lethal dad. Neeson is one of those stodgy respected actors, Irish, obviously, and with all sorts of classic stage roles and prestige pictures to his credit. He s an odd fit for the part of an ex-CIA American with an impressive homicidal skill-set who s given it all up in order to repair his relationship with his teenage daughter (Maggie Grace). But it works pretty well. Neeson is sad-faced and lumbering and low-wattage, which is great for the early scenes when he goes through the ritual everyday-life humiliations that will key us all up to watch him do maximum damage later. He lives in a crap apartment in L.A., and he s scorned by his gratuitously mean ex-wife (Famke Janssen, who really ought to think about whether she needs the money this bad) and her rich buffoon of a second husband (Xander Berkeley). Sad Dad also has to take stupid jobs to get by, like guarding a Britney-esque pop singer at a concert where someone with a sensitive ear for music is sure to want her dead. In his free time, he sits around at home staring at photos of his daughter. Some action fans will wonder if we needed to see quite so much corny daughter-love and cringy dad-humiliation before getting to the action. It IS a little weird, the lingering thoroughness of the set-up. But it makes sense in the long run. They re piling it on in the old-melodrama style, so that when the daughter finally gets abducted while on a trip to Paris, by evil Albanians yet, the violent payback can be unleashed with a whoosh. When I saw it, you could hear the whole audience settle tensely in their seats, as if to say,  Okay, NOW it s on.  Because Neeson is big and slow-looking in certain shots he looks like Frankenstein s monster s handsome brother there s a real pleasure in seeing him break somebody s face swiftly and efficiently. He can run, too, with a sort of speeding-train heftiness. And he looks invariably stoic, with a nice middle-aged melancholy in his creased face. He s even reasonable a lot of the time. If they d just give his daughter back, everybody could walk away. But they won t. And this begins to irritate him. At one point, he shoots somebody who s pleading,  Wait, we can nego !  It was great to be back in the atmosphere of intense audience involvement after seeing so many films viewed in the dutiful stupor produced by  quality  cinema. There s a scene in Taken when Neeson gets jumped, and we all groaned  Ohhhh!!  in unison. If there had been time to warn him, someone probably would ve shouted,  Look behind you!  Of course, this kind of audience identification flushes out some unpleasant emotions as well. I was in an urban downtown theater that s going to seed, and there were some of the usual fringe types there, exuding vague menace. These are often middle-aged men who look broke and on the edge, and each one sits alone in simmering silence. Occasionally one will boil over and yell something at the screen. This time around, it was,  Slap her! , regarding Famke Janssen s harpy ex-wife character. Awkward. There can be no question that movies like this are built to give an adrenaline rush that s stoked, in part, by bitter resentments, crude old prejudices, and weird lusts. All that daughter-love, for example, devolves into some very peculiar scenes like the one when the girl s virginity is being auctioned off to zillionaire creeps in glass booths, and her dad winds up putting in a bid himself. In order to save her, of course. But yeesh! (This calls to mind aspects of Luc Besson s earlier work, like, for example, The Professional, which focuses on disturbingly beautiful twelve-year-old Natalie Portman, dressed and acting like she s twenty-five. Besson has her telling baggy-eyed old hitman Jean Reno that she has very strong feelings for him in her, uh, lower-stomach area. One suspects Besson s got issues.) In short, any sensitivity to aggressive misogyny and racial stereotyping which are long-standing components of the action film, as well as most of the artworks of Western Civilization, and are more or less the price to be paid for enjoying them should be checked at the theater door or untold suffering will result.",ASI_Doc1_Taken,ASI,Action,Positive,Taken
71,ASI_Doc2_Taken,"Wendy and Lucy opens with a tranquil, intimate scene of the title characters, a young woman and her dog, playing outdoors. Wendy (played by Michelle Williams) is the sort of woman you might see on the street   slender, medium height, short dark hair, jeans and T-shirt, wearing a vaguely wounded expression, with a shy, diffident manner, almost to the point of being affectless, but entirely benign and peaceful. Lucy, for her part, is a friendly, nondescript mutt. The innocent title sequence gives way to something a bit sketchier. As night falls, Lucy runs ahead into the woods and Wendy catches up with her at a campfire where a group of potentially menacing neo-hobos are sitting around loudly bragging about their exploits. The mood of suppressed violence builds. We begin to wonder why Wendy is hanging out with them. Maybe she should think about heading home. But then she s back in her car, and we suddenly realize that her car is her home, that Wendy and Lucy are on the road   specifically, from Indiana to Alaska to find work in the canneries, and now they ve come to rest, tentatively, somewhere in Oregon. Their money has just run out. Wendy and Lucy is a portrait of the blues. It s tempting to imagine that this ultra-naturalistic, hard-scrabble chronicle of a migrant-laboring woman and her dog came tumbling out of the movie chute at exactly the right moment, that director Kelly Reichardt and co-writer Jonathan Raymond somehow foresaw the current economic distress that Wendy seems to symbolize and timed the production perfectly to fit the national predicament. But Wendy would probably be just as unmoored in any time and place. It s in her nature. In her we can see a bit of Sandrine Bonnaire s defiant female drifter in Agn s Varda s Vagabond, as well as the passive, inward-bending body language of the young  models  in Robert Bresson s later films, weakly struggling against their fate. Wendy s weary road trip takes a few of the same turns we ve witnessed in, say, Terrence Malick s Days of Heaven or any number of American hard-luck screen stories of life on the road. The lonely, melancholy rhythms are familiar and so are the details. Filmmakers Reichardt and Raymond, who collaborated on the eccentric 2006 character study Old Joy (also set in the Oregon forests) know the emotional landscape well   Wendy and Lucy is adapted from Raymond s short story  Train Choir.  They re determined to make us see and feel the same things Wendy does, and it s a humbling, completely absorbing experience. Wendy and Lucy encounter other people along the way, but aside from a kindly security guard (Wally Dalton) they re as indifferent to Wendy s increasingly desperate situation as the trees in the wind. Veteran actor Will Patton, past master at conveying untrustworthiness, shows up as the manager of the repair shop who pronounces Wendy s car DOA. Lucy gets lost. Wendy is caught shoplifting dog chow. Faces come out of the rain. Wendy responds to each new setback by curling tighter into a ball. For actor Williams (Synecdoche, New York; I m Not There; Brokeback Mountain) the role is an exercise in holding it all in, well past the breaking point, of quietly imploding amid the freight yards and crummy commercial strips of beat-out America. Wendy and Lucy is the blues, pure and simple. Lucy Hill (Ren e Zellweger), the protagonist of Jonas Elmer s sweet, gooey romantic comedy New in Town, also finds herself with a case of the cross-country lonelies. Miami-based food corporation exec Lucy jumps at the chance to take the reins of one of the company s ailing snack food plants and make a name for herself by cutting the dead wood, etc.   even though that means temporarily moving to frosty New Ulm, Minnesota, where the women tend scrapbooks and bake cakes, the men go ice fishing, and everybody eats tapioca pudding. Plenty of Fargo-style jokes, led by actor Siobhan Fallon Hogan in the role of Blanche Gunderson, irrepressible admin assist at Munck Foods. Cold-nipples-through-the-sweater joke. High-heels don t work in snowy bootland, lady. An extended How-Do-Women-in-Coveralls-Pee-in-the-Woods joke. Ted the studly, beer-drinking union rep (Harry Connick Jr.) changes Lucy s mind about the Great White North, even though he s essentially a corporation-fighting radical. Lucy s MBA-ese pep talks can t hold a candle to the joshing of the factory workers and their foreman, Stu (the wonderful J.K. Simmons). Stu s reference to    faster than thin shit through a tall Swede  takes the early lead in the 2009 dialogue sweepstakes. Zellweger has seldom shown off her body to such advantage   obviously the Bridget Jones years have been left behind. She and Connick work well together in one of the oldest plots in existence, and the moral of the story fits the flip side of the Wendy and Lucy coin   keep it local, stupid. The third film in this week s  Women on the Road  trilogy is a bit of a stretch. Taken is pretty much all Liam Neeson s show. The wiry Irish international actor stars in the sort of part Harrison Ford would have gotten ten or fifteen years ago (or Gene Hackman, twenty years ago): rescuing his teenage offspring from repulsive villains in foreign locations. Devoted dad Bryan Mills (Neeson), an ex-CIA agent who clearly misses the life, has moved to LA just to be close to daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), a spoiled child who lives with her mother, Bryan s ex-wife (Famke Janssen), and a ridiculously rich stepdad. Kim plans to traipse through Europe with her best friend over the objections of her father, who knows from experience how naughty the Euros can be. Sure enough, the two girls barely spend five minutes in Paris before they re snatched by a gang of crud-encrusted Albanians who intend to dope them up and sell them as sex slaves. This will not stand, vows Bryan. Taken was cobbled together by French writer-producer Luc Besson (I Love You Philip Morris, Transporter 3, La Femme Nikita), writer Robert Mark Kamen, and cinematographer-turned-director Pierre Morel. They could very easily have gone the Hostel sex-and-guignol route but that would have obviated Neeson, seen here in, if not Gangs of New York shape, at least in credible fighting form. Armed mostly with smarts and knuckles, Bryan punches and shoots legions of Balkan plug-uglies on his way to the final showdown with, yes, a fat sheik on a yacht, deflowering pricey auctioned virgins by the carload.

This presents an interesting experiment, actually. Considering that there aren't really any surprises to be found in Taken, beyond those we were offered in the pre-release snippet, are splendidly realized action sequences enough to carry this film? The answer here is a resounding ""yes"". Taken may be a simple film, but it's not simplistic, and even though the first third of it is spent recapping what we knew going in, the second and third acts here deliver enough thrills and action to make this film riveting, even if we know exactly where it's going. By setting the chase within the ultra-sleazy world of human trafficking, which we secretly hope is just a media creation, but know deep inside that this reprehensible and inhumane phenomenon is a reality, the film is propelled by a sense of urgency that isn't present in most revenge films. Liam Neeson's daughter isn't ""Dead"", she's ""Taken"", so his race against the ticking stopwatch tracking her probable fate provides enough tension to diffuse any disappointment in knowing exactly what's going to happen here. The selling point here is how deftly Liam Neeson hacks his way through a bevy of Albanian baddies. Neeson is untested as an action star, but watching him maneuver his way through the sea of detritus here, we're left hoping that he's got a franchise in him. The film may not have the intricacies of the expertly crafted Bourne films (although, like every action film made since Bourne appeared on the screen, the fight scenes here owe an obviously rich debt to Matt Damon's antics), but the gritty and realistic path Neeson carves to get to his stolen daughter is sufficient to deliver the promise implied by the fantastic trailer. You don't have to be a parent to understand and sympathize with Liam's plight here, and there is a morbid but exhilarating sense of release in seeing the evil empire pay for its transgressions. Sometimes morally complex, ambiguous studies of man's desire for revenge are too preachy to be entertaining. Taken doesn't really care if you like Liam Neeson or wonder if he's doing the right thing by flagrantly taking the law into his own hands; the film just wants you to strap yourself in and enjoy the tidings as he hands out beat-downs all over Paris. This film doesn't want you to think. Like Neeson's character quickly realizes, thinking is often not a luxury present in dire circumstances like these. Action is what counts, and for those who miss the era of the lean, mean 85-minute skull-crack fest, Taken will re-conjure the giddy thrills of watching Dudikoff, Seagal, and Van-Damme chomp through a slew of B-Movie terrorists. Having an Oscar-caliber actor delivering the judo chops only sweetens the pot. Forget about Oscars, plot points, or coherence. This dude's daughter has been kidnapped, and he's a former government agent trained to make bad guys' lives a living hell. Do you want to see him find his daughter and take down the scum who took her? Of course you do. Even reading this review is over-analyzing it.",ASI_Doc3_Taken,ASI,Action,Positive,Taken
73,ASI_Doc4_Taken,"Who knew Liam Neeson, the same highly regarded actor who's made a living starring in such sophisticated and acclaimed films as  Schindler's List,   Nell,   Rob Roy  and  Kinsey,  could be so convincing as a kick-butt-and-take-names-later action hero? We all know that Neeson can act, and act extremely well, but I can't fault anyone for thinking he might be a little out of place in director Pierre Morel's  Taken,  a fast and furious offspring of the  Bourne  franchise and the television show  24.  It's easy to doubt Neeson's ability to pull off such a role because he's never really done it before (Sorry, but I don't count  Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace ), and let's be honest here, how many 56-year-old actors can effectively play a tough-as-nails vigilante who can easily take down loads of evil thugs half his age? It is often said you never get a second chance to make a first impression, and fortunately Neeson has made the most of his initial offering to the action genre. In fact, a large part of the appeal of  Taken  comes from Neeson and the credibility he brings to a film that oftentimes deals with preposterous and unrealistic situations. That's not to take anything away from today's top action stars - Jason Statham, Vin Diesel or Mark Wahlberg, to name a few - but it is very rare that action junkies like myself get to experience watching an actor with the same demanding screen presence and swagger as Neeson. The gravitas and complexity that is provided by Neeson actually ends up adding an extra layer of depth to  Taken,  and his memorable performance will make you wish he would've considered dabbling with the action genre a whole lot sooner in his career. With that said, it should come as no surprise that he seems right at home playing Bryan Mills, a newly retired CIA operative who left his job and moved to Los Angeles so he could be closer to his 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace, formerly of the television series  Lost ), much to the chagrin of his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) and her new, filthy rich husband (Xander Berkeley). Kim may be happy that Bryan wants to be a part of her life, but the thing she wants more than anything is for him to sign a permission slip that will allow her to spend the summer in Paris with her girlfriend. As an overprotective father who has seen the worst the world has to offer, Bryan is reluctant to potentially put his daughter in harm's way, but, after all, he wants to stay on her good side so he eventually caves in to her request. However, daddy apparently knows best because soon after Kim and her friend arrive in the City of Lights, they are abducted by a mysterious bunch of Albanians who are so merciless even the Russians give them a wide berth. But if you think the kidnappers are going to get away with their prized possessions scot-free, you are sorely mistaken. Just before Kim is whisked away against her will, she is able to use her cell phone to provide Bryan with some information about her captors, which proves to be a father's worst nightmare. With some help from his former CIA colleagues, Bryan puts the pieces together and learns his daughter's abductors are a nasty group that kidnaps teenagers, drugs them and sells them off as sex slaves. And to make matters worse, Bryan has a 96-hour window to find Kim or he will likely never see her again. So it's off to Paris for Bryan, and with the particular set of skills he's acquired over a very long career in the shadows, he vows to recover his loving daughter, even if it means tearing down the Eiffel Tower.  Taken  might move a little slowly in the first 20 minutes or so for some, but once Bryan lands in the foreign country to find his daughter, Morel rarely lets up on the exhilarating, frantic action. You are never going to believe everything you see in a movie like  Taken,  but Morel paces the action with such rhythm that you'll hardly have time to think about anything else other than cars, bullets and fists flying across the screen. But as amusing as  Taken  is, the script from Luc Besson ( The Professional,   The Fifth Element  and  The Transporter ) and Robert Mark Kamen ( The Karate Kid  and  Lethal Weapon 3 ) is not something you would call cutting-edge. Some of the action scenes do get a little repetitious and those of you who crave violence might be a little disappointed because most of the bloodshed occurs just off-screen. (I hear there will probably be an unrated version of the film released on DVD, so some of you will have to wait a couple month for the experience you were hoping for.) And although Neeson gives it his all as a one-man wrecking crew, the performances from the rest of the cast are rather lackluster. Janssen doesn't have much to do here and Grace, who was phenomenal at playing a spoiled brat in  Lost,  is entirely unconvincing as a teenager. As you can see,  Taken  does have a few glaring weaknesses, but there wasn't a minute that went by when I wasn't entertained or glued to my seat. And when I go see a mindless action film, that's the thing I care about most.",ASI_Doc4_Taken,ASI,Action,Positive,Taken
74,ASI_Doc5_Taken,"At age 56, Liam Neeson still looks like a formidable slab of muscle looped over steel. In the new action-thriller Taken, Neeson could probably beat his adversaries into submission with his vast stony forehead, but unless I misremember, he doesn t use that particular lethal weapon. He kicks, punches, chops, slashes, shoots, and slams more than one face into more than one wall or door. We almost feel sorry for the poor Armenian scum who have unwisely chosen to kidnap Neeson s daughter to sell her as a sex slave. They re well-armed and well-connected, but they re up against all six feet and four inches of Liam Neeson in all his righteous wrath. It doesn t seem fair, really. Neeson s character, Bryan Mills, used to work for the government as a  preventer  of  bad things.  He has retired in order to spend more time with wide-eyed teenage daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), though he also has to weather the disapproving scowl of ex-wife Famke Janssen; Bryan probably likes his chances better against the Armenians. Kim and a friend get kidnapped in Paris, and Bryan swings into action. He looms over his ex s current rich husband (Xander Berkeley) and demands a private flight to France   it s every ex-husband s dream moment. Taken is a standard give-me-back-my-spawn thriller, but as written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen it s admirably stripped down   less the credits, you re out of there in under 90 minutes   and it shares Bryan s unearthly focus. It s good that the first act shows off Neeson s warm side   Bryan s daughter is his only weakness, and he s blissful when he s around her. He doesn t need a big speech about how Kim represents the innocence that he wants to preserve in such a cold, corrupt world   we get that when he looks at her, and also when he frets about every step she proposes to take on her Eurotrip. Neeson has been a sorely underrated actor, a solid and somber presence but, despite appearing in box-office hits, never quite a star. But Taken proves his star quality in a way no film has since Neeson s early- 90s salad days in Schindler s List and, yes, Darkman. Bryan s odyssey through the slime, with frequent concussive scenes in which various Euro-scum are the bowling pins and Bryan is the bowling ball, is on some level Hardcore meets Die Hard. But there s undeniable pleasure in watching a man of Neeson s power and intelligence unleashing both on scruffy anonymous lowlifes. What could be simplistic and cheesy in other hands becomes iconic. Luc Besson has a knack for pure-cinema adrenaline rides (his protege Pierre Morel directed) that do away with anything inessential   that take red meat and boil it down to the bone. Despite its grim emphasis, Taken is not without humor; I particularly enjoyed Bryan s visit to an old colleague turned Paris police desk jockey, whose oblivious wife serves dinner to the two mutually wary men   the way she chirps  Carrots?  to the brooding Neeson is the funniest offer of food in a movie since Marlon Brando proffered biscuits in The Island of Dr. Moreau. You may be forgiven for looking askance at Taken, which bounced around global theaters for a while before 20th Century-Fox dumped it into a no-confidence late-January slot. But there is a place for pulp done properly and well; the movie displays little art, but it doesn t have to. Its furious sense of purpose   get in, find the girl, get out   matches Liam Neeson s. And, come to think of it, there is a kind of artistry in the sheer craft and intensity on display. But don t let that stop you.",ASI_Doc5_Taken,ASI,Action,Positive,Taken
75,ASI_Doc6_Taken,"On the narrative level, Taken is a fairly routine action thriller about a retired CIA operative who is forced to break out his tools and flex his old skills when his virginal teenage daughter is kidnapped abroad by human traffickers. There is little to distinguish it from dozens of interchangeable straight-to-DVD concoctions except for the fact that is stars Liam Neeson, who brings an immediate sense of heavyweight gravitas to what could have easily been a lightweight central role filled by any run-of-the-mill B-list action star. Once you put the man who has played Oskar Schindler, Michael Collins, Rob Roy, Jean Valjean, and Qui-Gon Jinn--vastly disparate roles, to be sure, but all of which are unified by their underlying intensity--the film is inherently transformed into something meatier. It gives the illusion of emotional depth and complexity where, in fact, there is none, but it s still an effective ploy. Unfortunately, the film itself doesn t quite live up to the dramatic heft provided by its star. Written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, who are now on their seventh collaboration after The Fifth Element (1997), Kiss of the Dragon (2001), Bandidas (2006), and the three Transporter films (2002 2008), Taken is fueled primarily by its sense righteous vengeance, which is highly contagious, especially in desperate times when audiences are looking for a cathartic release. Besson and Kamen provide plenty of irredeemable bad guys, including a group Armenian thugs who do the kidnapping, a group of soulless international businessmen (including an American) who wear tuxedoes and sip champagne while buying human bodies, and a corpulent Middle Eastern sheik whose wallowing girth marks him as the epitome of consumption takent to its grotesquely logical end. It s a rogue s gallery of depravity at all income levels, and Neeson s Bryan Mills blasts his way through all of them. Yet, that is precisely where the film comes up short. At virtually every turn it feels like it s pulling punches and not delving into the potentially dangerous visual terrain its story and its attendant emotions are screaming for (part of this may be due to the editing of the film s international version to earn a PG-13 rating for U.S. distribution, but my gut tells me the film is missing more than just a few seconds on the cutting room floor). The violence is quite brutal and Mills proves that he is not above shooting an arguably innocent woman (in the arm, but still ...) if it means he has a better chance of recovering his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). But director Pierre Morel, one of Besson s prot g s, keeps the violence visually restrained, which puts it in direct conflict with the film s underlying emotional premise. Besson has always had a soft spot for killers with a heart (see, especially, 1994 s Leon), and Mills fits right in that category. When we first meet him, he is first and foremost a father who has given up his dangerous black ops career to get closer to Kim, but finds that he is constantly one-upped by his wife (Famke Janssen), who is one of those mothers who is constantly trying to be  cool,  and her wealthy husband (Xander Berkeley). There is genuine heart in the film s early scenes, and we feel the pain that Mills feels when he is confronted with the gap between him and his daughter, which is what makes his determination to recover her stick emotionally. When she is kidnapped, she happens to be on the phone with him, and the cool, steady manner in which he directs her actions to give him the best chance of tracking her hums with tension because we sense the conflict between his emotionality as a father and his level-headed professionalism as a former black ops agent. In those moments, the two sides of his personality become fused, which turns his necessarily violent responses into something more than just action movie fare. It s paternal love turned vicious, and if Morel had found a way to translate that emotional visually and make it truly sting, Taken might have verged on something profoundly visceral, rather than just duly entertaining.",ASI_Doc6_Taken,ASI,Action,Negative,Taken
76,ASI_Doc7_Taken,"Liam Neeson was up for but never got to play James Bond, and now he s getting even. In the violent, churning and laughably derivative action bruiser Taken, he s a suave, power-knuckled and once-lethal secret agent named Bryan Mills who, in truth, is just as mean as 007 but maybe slightly more human (he s an ex-husband, as well as a parent who loves his child unconditionally). And he s paid a price for his fists. Bryan once devoted so much concentration and energy to his job as a  preventer  ( I prevented bad things from happening ) that his wife (a wasted Famke Janssen, who usually plays these roles herself) left him for a rich California businessman and took their daughter with them. So Bryan retired, moved to Los Angeles to make up for the frayed relationship with his estranged daughter Kim and sacrificed his own career to be near her. All he does now is grill steaks for his buddies and work occasional security jobs like guarding pop stars at rock concerts. But old habits die hard, and Bryan has forgotten none of the special skills he learned from his years with the C.I.A. a knowledge of weapons, wiretaps, deciphering secret codes, scaling buildings like Batman and wiping out anything that gets in his way without regret if he suddenly needs them. When his virginal 17-year-old (huh? In L.A.?) embarks with her girlfriend on a whirlwind tour following the rock group U2 across Europe and, within hours of her arrival in Paris, gets kidnapped by Albanian white slavers, Bryan shifts into demolition mode and takes no prisoners. He may be a has-been, but within 96 hours he s torn down everything in Paris with his bare hands except the Eiffel Tower. First, he leaves a message on the kidnappers  cell phone, which just happens to be lying under the bed where his daughter is hiding:  I will look for you. I will find you. And I will kill you.  He does, of course, but not before he slam-dunks his way through the City of Light, turning it into darkness. Equipped with Uzis, knives, swords and even an electric chair, Bryan works without official supervision or an expense account, yet never seems to run out of steam or cash. And there is no limit to his ability to tap international phone lines, spark the ignition in foreign cars without keys and find new ways to torture and kill his victims. In one scene, when he fails to get the right answer from a man strapped to a chair in the middle of a brutal interrogation, he electrocutes him, filling the room with smoke, fire and the smell of burning flesh. Each new victim (including some of France s leading power players) only piques the simmering rage of a vengeful parent, and we all know that a dangerous secret agent with a mission makes for panic in the streets. Turning the tables on master fiends, police officials and their families, ransacking Paris for clues, Bryan ends up in a shootout on a luxury yacht on the Seine only minutes before Kim is to be raped by an Arab sheik who looks like Jabba the Hutt. To be generous, it s far-fetched to a fault. Worse still, it s all been done before. Moving from the theme of vigilante dad (Death Wish), to the strategies of slave traders who traffic girls into prostitution on Internet auctions (Trade), to the tragic spectacle of a scrupulous outsider who slides down the sinkhole of an alternate underworld universe of crime, decadence and perversion (Paul Schrader s Hardcore), this hack job has not a shred of originality. Liam Neeson is an unconventional choice to play an action hero. His big, wrinkled smile is at dismaying odds with the lurid mayhem that surrounds him, and how does a brawny American C.I.A. operative account for that lyrical Irish accent? In the end, nobody is called to task for the bodies that litter the streets of Paris, the automobiles and real estate that lie in rubbish left behind or the heroin injections that have mysteriously worn off, leaving Kim heading home to a career as a rock star. Taken is the kind of exploitative junk everyone expects from no-talent French hack Luc Besson, who made the dreadful Transporter films, although this time out he s only the producer and the co-writer of the moronic script, leaving the ossified direction to Pierre Morel. After this horror, you might think twice about sending a teenager to Paris without a chaperone, but it could be worse.

77,ASI_Doc8_Taken,"On August 25, 2006, a Romanian named Cristian Nemescu was killed in a car crash at the age of twenty-seven. He was returning from an editing suite, where he had been working on a cut of  California Dreamin .  This was Nemescu s first feature as a director, and we will never know exactly how the finished film would have looked; the regret, though deep, is not all-consuming, because  California Dreamin    bears almost no trace of the tyro. It could use a trim, but only rarely does it strain for effect, and, for a young man, Nemescu was uncannily versed in the emotions of middle age free-floating rancor, the creak of unhelpful wisdom, and a covetous sigh at the spectacle of lust. If it s regret you want, don t mourn the director; just watch his movie. The year is 1999, during the conflict in Kosovo, and the place is Constanta, Romania, on the Black Sea. A platoon of American marines has arrived with a shipment of military radar, to be deployed near the Serbian border in support of air raids by the NATO coalition. The plan is to put the equipment on a train and escort it across Romania: hardly an errand to perplex the guy in charge, Captain Jones (Armand Assante). That s what he thinks. On a sleepy summer s day, the train grinds into a railroad station in the village of Capalnita, at the back end of nowhere, to be met by the devil incarnate. His name is Doiaru (Razvan Vasilescu), he is the stationmaster, and, like all the best Beelzebubs, he doesn t look the part. With his lined and grizzled face, poised to crease into a smile, he could be the gentlest of patriarchs; but the man is a beast, who has built up a black market, terrorized the other villagers, and brought a nearby factory to its knees. He loves his daughter Monica (Maria Dinulescu), a sullen beauty of seventeen, but his love or, as she sees it, his dread of being alone vents itself as a fearsome wish to control. No wonder she longs to cut loose. And here comes her chance: a herd of American boys, as dazed and horny as bullocks in the wrong pasture. They expect a brief halt, instead of which they linger for five days and browse among the locals. This is because Doiaru uncouples the engine and demands customs documentation, which nobody seems able to provide. Single-handed, in other words, he blocks the progress of American might, and why? A succession of haunting flashbacks to his own boyhood, in the Second World War, when he waited for Allied help that never came, suggests a possible cause, but Vasilescu s earthy performance tells of something more stubbornly rooted: a force of ill will, which cannot abide the good will of others. The irony is that, in stopping the train, he sets off a burst of everything he loathes: friendship, zeal, and the fireworks of desire. The mayor of Capalnita, spotting a chance to put his little kingdom on the map, invites the troops to a barbecue party, where he wears a Stars and Stripes tie. We even get an Elvis impersonator, crooning  Love Me Tender  in a Romanian burr. There is nothing new, of course, in the comedy of the backwater that gets swamped by the mainstream, or by a gush of good fortune, but even films as winning as  Whisky Galore!  or  Local Hero  didn t dare to propose that the backwater itself might be corrupted and crazed with boredom, whereas one father in Capalnita tells his son to flee to Bucharest and threatens to break his legs if he ever comes back. When Captain Jones takes the stage at a village meeting, at the mayor s request, he describes the place as paradise. The elders applaud, but you know what their juniors would say so busily, and wittily, does Nemescu show these characters striking their various political attitudes (there is a hapless intrusion from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) that the film has no time to get locked into an attitude of its own. What it has, instead, is an appetite for human quiddity, and an eye for those fleeting shocks in which cultures strike and rebound. To this extent, it is Monica, not her father, who is at the movie s heart; having conceived a passion for Jones s handsome deputy, Sergeant McLaren (Jamie Elman), she gets an English-speaking classmate who happens to adore her to interpret the bashful endearments that she and the sergeant wish to trade. The result is a masterly, international update of the Cyrano situation. ( I would like to kiss you  is translated as  He wants to know what kind of music you listen to. ) On the one hand, Monica is impetuous to the point of brusque; when that kiss comes, his lips draw near for a tentative peck, and she practically jumps down his throat. On the other hand, taking a cue from Nemescu, she is wise beyond her years, and fully aware that McLaren is not an escape route but a midsummer crush. At the end, with the train finally set to leave, he begs her to write her phone number on his hand; having watched her recede into the night, he opens his palm, and finds that she has scrawled a childish sun. She has loved him tender, but let him go; the whole film, you might say raunchy and delicate, endlessly alive to the dashing of hope is a study in arrivals and departures. Hurrying back to the village, Monica finds it in uproar, with her father under attack. If ever the Americans were needed, now is the time; but Jones and his men are gone. The conundrum posed by  Taken  is as old as cinema itself. Do stars degrade themselves when they take a role in trash, or does their very presence redeem the folly, turning up something that glitters amid the dross? A trenchcoated Robert Mitchum, for instance, sauntered through the villainous Europe of  Foreign Intrigue  (1956), but his saunter is pretty much all that remains; the rest of the movie was forgettable to start with. Now we have another looming hulk, Liam Neeson, laying similar waste to a posse of un-American scoundrels. Like Mitchum, Neeson has shoulders so wide that you have to inspect the back of his jacket to make sure that he didn t leave the coat hanger in. Like Mitchum, too, he appears to move slowly, at his noble leisure, yet to act with daunting swiftness when the occasion demands. He is more alert than Mitchum, whose brand of cool verged on the narcoleptic, but both men lord it over their surroundings not with a wink but with a bang. Why spoof the world when you can wreck it with a straight face? In  Taken,  Neeson plays a former C.I.A. hand named Bryan Mills, who is divorced from his wife (Famke Janssen) and living in Los Angeles to be near his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). If there s one thing we ve learned from  California Dreamin ,  it s that seventeen-year-old daughters get into scrapes. And if there s one thing we ve learned from  24  it s that anybody named Kim, with a father schooled in dirty work by the U.S. government, will have a large echo chamber where her brain is meant to be. Kim and a friend leave for a vacation in Europe, where, ignoring the advice of her father, they are abducted with such consummate speed that it might have been simpler if he had FedExed them directly to the kidnappers. Pausing only to borrow a private jet from his ex s slimy husband, Mills flies to Paris, where he proceeds to work his way, without mercy, through a personal alphabet of undesirable aliens. This being a brisk affair, of little more than ninety minutes, he gets only as far as Albanians and Arabs, but, if I were an innocent Bermudan, let alone a Belgian, I would be starting to get nervous about a sequel. The producer and co-writer is Luc Besson, and the director is Pierre Morel, who made the superior  District B13.  That had Paris under its fingernails, whereas  Taken  darts from one location to the next without probing the city that lies between the hot spots, although Neeson would argue that, once you learn to drive like a Parisian, the opportunities for sightseeing tend to flash past. His performance is the most perturbing thing in the film, even more so than its electrical-torture sequence or its revelations about sex-trafficking; Mills, like some older, vaster brother of Daniel Craig s James Bond, seems driven to or, increasingly, driven by acts of vengeance that are only obliquely related to the wrong that is being avenged. The chop and swipe of his forearms, with or without a knife, become as mechanical as the hammer blows of a blacksmith, and the point at which he casually shoots a friend s wife (who has invited him to stay for supper), in order to extract information from the friend, is either proof of Mills s own madness or, at best, a thoughtful critique of the decline in domestic French cuisine. True, the friend has turned out to be false, but that in itself is a startling development, with Morel and Besson presumably happy to present their native land as not merely spiced with imported peril but intrinsically treacherous. Someone, no doubt, is already composing a thesis on  Symbolic paranoia and American foreign policy in mid-period Neeson,  and you do wonder how this commanding actor who carries so much more conviction than the plot felt about delivering the line  I ll tear down the Eiffel Tower if I have to.  The movie opened in France almost a year ago; was it wise to delay its release here until the dawn of the new Presidency, when it so clearly belongs to the last one?",ASI_Doc8_Taken,ASI,Action,Negative,Taken
78,ASI_Doc9_Taken,"If CIA agents in general were as skilled as Bryan Mills in particular, Osama bin Laden would have been an American prisoner since late September 2001. ""Taken"" shows Mills as a one-man rescue squad, a master of every skill, a laser-eyed, sharpshooting, pursuit-driving, pocket-picking, impersonating, knife-fighting, torturing, karate-fighting killing machine who can cleverly turn over a petrol tank with one pass in his car and strategically ignite it with another. We meet Mills (Liam Neeson) in ""sort of retirement"" in Los Angeles, grilling steaks with old CIA buddies and yearning to spend more time with his 17-year-old daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace). Kim now lives with her mom, Mills' ex-wife (Famke Janssen), and her effortlessly mega-rich husband (Xander Berkeley), whose idea of a birthday present is giving Kim not a pony, but what looks like a thoroughbred. Mills has seen action in Afghanistan and apparently everywhere else, and knows it's a dangerous world for a naive teenage girl. He is against Kim spending the summer in Paris with her girlfriend, even though ""cousins"" will apparently chaperone. He's right. Kim and her pal succeed in getting themselves kidnapped the afternoon of the same day they get off the plane, although Kim has time for one terrified phone call to Dad before she's taken away. Now listen to this. Using CIA contacts at Langley, Mills is able to use his garbled tape of their conversation to determine the name of his girl's kidnapper (Marko), that he is Albanian, that his ring kidnaps young tourists, drugs them and runs them as prostitutes; the virgins are auctioned off to Arab sheiks and so on. Headquarters also tells Mills he has 96 hours to rescue his daughter before she meets a fate worse than death, followed by death. With this kind of intelligence, the CIA could be using bin Laden's Visa card in every ATM in Virginia. It's the set-up for a completely unbelievable action picture where Mills is given the opportunity to use one element of CIA spycraft after another, read his enemies' minds, eavesdrop on their telephones, spy on their meetings and, when necessary, defeat roomfuls of them in armed combat. At one point, a former colleague in the Paris police says he has left seven bodies behind. He's just getting warmed up. How this man and his daughter could hope to leave France on a commercial flight doesn't speak highly of the French police -- and the new ""Pink Panther"" doesn't open for a week. Oh, why does he have only 96 hours? To provide the movie with a handy deadline, that's why. It's always a puzzle to review a movie like this. On the one hand, it's preposterous. But who expects a ""Bourne""-type city-wrecking operative to be plausible? On the other hand, it's very well-made. Liam Neeson brings the character a hard-edged, mercilessly focused anger, and director Pierre Morel hurtles through action sequences at a breathless velocity. If Kim is an empty-headed twit, well, she's offscreen most of the time, and the villains are walking showcases for testosterone gone bad. The only tiny glitch is that if one chase scene doesn't use the same ramp down to a construction site that the opening of ""Quantum of Solace"" did, it sure looks like it does. ""Taken"" reopens a question I've had. A lot of movies involve secret clubs or covens of rich white men who meet for the purposes of despoiling innocent women in despicable perversity. The men are usually dressed in elegant formalwear, smoke cigars and have champagne poured for them by discreet servants. Do such clubs actually exist? Since every member would be blackmailable, how could they survive? If you lost everything in a Ponzi scheme, would you betray your lodge members? Just wondering. The movie proves two things. (1) Liam Neeson can bring undeserved credibility to most roles just by playing them, and (2) Luc Besson, the co-writer, whose actioner-assembly line produced this film, turns out high-quality trash, and sometimes much better (""The Fifth Element,"" ""Taxi,"" ""The Transporter,"" ""La Femme Nikita,"" even ""The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada""). The bottom line is, if you can't wait for the next ""Bourne"" thriller, well, you don't have to.

Divorced from her mother and overshadowed by her filthy-rich stepfather, he would, he says, ``sacrifice anything for her.'' Specifically, he would kill each and every scum he meets in Paris. The number he does on the City of Lights is comparable, corpse-for-corpse, to any damage wreaked by Jason Bourne. With one key difference: Jason has a conscience, or wishes he did. Bryan has none. I mean none. The only life that means anything to him is Kim s, and when she gets nabbed by Albanian sex traffickers on a trip abroad, Bryan hops on a plane and lays waste to gay Paree.  You can t just run around tearing up Paris!  whines a French colleague (Olivier Rabourdin). Au contraire, Bryan says:  I ll tear down the Eiffel Tower if I have to.  Clench-jawed action star is a new gig for Neeson, but the Man Who Was Schindler has long worn the mantle of heroism. The twist this time is an utter lack of moral complexity. He s a dad, and he s a killing machine, and that s it. This blindered characterization makes for a driving premise and a few interesting scenes, but it gets to be a bore after the shock wears off. If he ll kill or maim just about anyone, where s the suspense? It s less Neeson s fault, or even director Pierre Morel s, than the movie s co-writers: Robert Mark Kamen and the entertainingly shlocky Luc Besson, who also produced. The Besson-Kamen writing team gave us The Fifth Element, all three Transporters and, most recently, a little Norwegian-Mexican comic Western called Bandidas. They re just the men for high-gloss knockabout bloodshed. So Bryan shoots people. He knifes them. He snaps their necks, sprays them with hot steam and chases them onto highway ramps where they re conveniently smooshed by oncoming traffic. He electrocutes a guy for information, then flips on the switch and leaves. He wings a lady whose only crime is cooking him a nice chicken dinner   and being married to the wrong man.The film s single most effective scene is the tense trans-Atlantic sequence when Kim, on the phone with her father, sees her airhead friend (Katie Cassidy) abducted in a Parisian flat and realizes the kidnappers are coming for her next. As Bryan instructs his daughter to scream identifying characteristics (height, hair color, tattoos) into her cell, the camera looks squarely at Neeson s pale brow and watery blue eyes. He doesn t cry; his face is gripped not by immobilizing grief but by pragmatism, professionalism and the need to act immediately. After he arrives in France, there s a bit of quirk with a fellow hired to translate Albanian. What a nifty touch   hey, Bourne never hired a temp. For a minute there, movie begins to approximate real-world logic. But then Bryan starts arguing with the Albanians in English, and they argue back in English, and at no point does anyone smack himself in the head and say,  Duh?! Isn t this France?  Bryan doesn t even arouse suspicion when he infiltrates the sex traders  kitchen as a faux French agent and proceeds to boss everyone around in Anglais. Generally, scenes begin with Bryan entering a building and end with a tangled splay of bodies. The fight choreography is fast, fatal and nonstop: raw meat for action devotees. But if it s unrepentant violence you re after, you re better off renting Morel s 2004 collaboration with Besson, District B13. It boasts lots of the same elements (Paris setting, inky crime, corrupt cops and a butt-kicking avenger out to rescue a kidnapped female relative), plus the exhilaration of Parkour chase scenes and the honesty of a hard-R rating. Despite the savagery of its violence, Taken is PG-13. That alone should give a parent cause to worry   especially Bryan.",ASI_Doc10_Taken,ASI,Action,Negative,Taken
140,DBG_Doc1_TheLostCity," The Lost City  Review: Raiders of the 1980s Blockbusters Sandra Bullock, Channing Tatum and a vamping Brad Pitt run around in a romantic adventure that you have seen before and will see again. If you don t have a few hours to watch the cheerfully dumb comedy  The Lost City,  just stare at the poster. Almost everything you need to know about this nonsensical lark is crammed into the one sheet: the stars, the tropical location, the Bruckheimer-esque fireball. The poster is selling sex and violence and obvious laughs, with Sandra Bullock s sequined purple onesie doing the heavy comic lifting. And while she and Channing Tatum are the headliners, the studio has hedged its bets by also cramming in a leering goat and a Fabio-ed Brad Pitt. The goat and Pitt are among the high points of the movie, a high-concept romp about a widowed writer, Loretta Sage (Bullock), making a tortuous re-entrance into the world. A successful romance novelist, Loretta writes books featuring a hunky dreamboat and throbbing verbs. For strained reasons, she is kidnapped while on a promo tour with the cover model for her books, Alan (Tatum). He tries to rescue her and soon they re joking through a jungle adventure featuring a lost treasure, and a deranged rich villain (Daniel Radcliffe) and his minions. Bullets and jokes fly, not always hitting their targets. That s more or less the movie, which is basically a vehicle for Bullock to play her most enduring role: Sandra Bullock, your supremely likable BFF. Genuine yet packaged, challenged but unsinkable, the Bullock BFF has been a mainstay for decades. She s endured rough patches, as in  Speed 2,  but has always bounced back, buoyed by a shrewdly deployed, indomitable persona that s wholesome, sardonic and goofy, though not (usually) insultingly so. Although she can handle a range of genres, she excels at comedy partly because she can play off a wide range of performers: Like all BFFs, she makes a generous double act. That said, it takes a while for Bullock and Tatum to find their groove, in part because he isn t as comfortable in his lunkhead role as he needs to be. He s playing a conventional sweet dope, a clich  role he handles fluidly when in Alan s exaggerated cover-model drag, complete with flowing hair and peekaboo waxed chest. But he is less facile when his character comes off as impossibly stupid, moments he plays by affecting a bit of a Mark Wahlberg whiny singsong. Is it homage, coincidence   who knows? Whatever the case, Tatum seems happier when his character fares better too, allowing him and Bullock to settle into a breezy intimacy. For the most part,  The Lost City  delivers exactly what it promises: A couple of highly polished avatars quipping and hitting their marks while occasionally being upstaged by their second bananas (Da Vine Joy Randolph included). There are some accommodations to contemporary mores. Tatum bares more skin than Bullock does, flashing his sculpted hindquarters in a scene that, like the movie overall, isn t as sharp or as funny as it should be. But while Loretta isn t as helpless as she might have been back in the old studio days, this is still about a man rescuing a woman whose eye makeup never runs even when she does. The director brothers Adam and Aaron Nee handle the many moving parts capably, working from a script they wrote with Oren Uziel and Dana Fox. Everything looks bright and in focus, and there are moments when the physical comedy pops, mostly when Pitt swashbuckles in. It s clear that someone involved in the making of this movie is a fan of Robert Zemeckis s 1984 romp  Romancing the Stone,  one of several adventure pastiches made in the wake of  Raiders of the Lost Ark.  While  Raiders  transcends its inspirations with wit and Steven Spielberg s filmmaking and  Romancing  tries hard to do the same,  The Lost City  remains a copy of a copy. It s too bad that  The Lost City  isn t more ambitious, because a woman writing her dreams into reality is a potentially rich riff on the Pygmalion and Galatea myth. Like  Romancing the Stone,   The Lost City  opens with a scene from a book   cue the purple prose and dashing hero   that its novelist heroine is writing. In  The Lost City,  Loretta deletes the scene because it doesn t work, but she can t erase the hero. He s a fantasy but he s all hers. That s the appeal of movies like this, which at a minimum understand that some of us hunger for fairy tales, even those that promise the stars and deliver Channing Tatum mooning.",DBG_Doc1_TheLostCity,DBG,Comedy,Negative,The Lost City
141,DBG_Doc2_TheLostCity," The Lost City  is Witless, Boring and Stupid We are curious which writer or director forced Sandra Bullock to deliver a two-page monologue to Channing Tatum's penis, but she's one of the producers so perhaps it isn't worth analyzing. Watching The Lost City is the cinematic equivalent of slogging your way through monkey poop.   I squirm and moan my way through stinkers all the time, but I can t actually remember the last time I saw a submental farce this witless, boring and stupid. Because the stars are Sandra Bullock, Channing Tatum and Daniel Radcliffe, with an inside-joke cameo by Brad Pitt in a long blonde wig, the appeal for audiences with low standards and no knowledge of (or interest in) genuine comedy timing is guaranteed.  But nobody in this comic-book twaddle displays any talent for farce, and it is doubtful that either of the two directors, Adam and Aaron Nee, could successfully stage the baking of a batch of Girl Scout cookies.  They also wrote the screenplay, which sounds like it was dictated by baboons on tranquilizers.  Two other so-called writers, Oren Uziel and Dana Fox,  are also credited.  I m curious which one forced Sandra Bullock to deliver a two-page monologue to Channing Tatum s penis. No point in dragging in the details.  Sandra Bullock is also one of the producers, so the fact that the film doesn t make one lick of sense is hardly worth analyzing.  She plays the author of violent, trashy adventure novels that appeal to giggling girls with IQs of less than 50.  Mr. Tatum plays a boneheaded Muscles McGurk named Alan, the hunky model on all of her book jackets who actually thinks he s the heroic character she created in her schlocky novels called Dash.  (For Dashiell Hammett, one erroneously presumes?)  Daniel Radcliffe, the faded glory of his Harry Potter days a distant memory, plays a billionaire nutcase who kidnaps them on a book promotion tour, convinced that Loretta can lead his gang of murderous criminals to the  well of endless tears,   the location of buried treasure described in one of her novels.  Brad Pitt plays Jack Trainer, an adventurer with Lady Gaga s hair who is recruited to rescue them not on a white horse, but on a scooter with a broken muffler.  They all end up on a volcanic island in the Atlantic (another joke that backfires) where Loretta thrashes her way through the brush in stiletto heels and a skin-tight purple sequin leotard, but hates getting wet ( I don t do water,  she protests  my body becomes like an eighth grader s face,  whatever that means.)  Alas, she ends up in a river with Alan, who emerges covered with leeches in the film s funniest scene.  Stripped naked, he bares his buttocks for her to ogle while she rips the leeches off his most intimate hot spots, saying  It s like picking anchovies out of my favorite salad.   These are the jokes, and you don t know whether to laugh or continue the nap from which you ve been rudely interrupted.   All that time and money spent on a cheap metaphor,  groans Daniel Radcliffe at the end of The Lost City.  He must be describing the movie itself.",DBG_Doc2_TheLostCity,DBG,Comedy,Negative,The Lost City
142,DBG_Doc3_TheLostCity,"The Lost City is probably best viewed as a romantic comedy spiced by adventure elements rather than the other way around. Regardless, it s passably sweet entertainment but, just as it s unlikely to stick in the craw, it won t hold a place in one s memory, either. The generic-sounding title is appropriate for the material. The term  popcorn movie  somehow seems too substantial for a project like this, which relies on the likability of the leads and the chemistry between them. A better descriptor might be  cotton candy movie.  Those old enough to remember will note similarities between The Lost City and 1984 s Romancing the Stone, which incorporated a love story between Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner into an Indiana Jones-inspired jungle-based treasure hunt. Although the details are different, the basic template remains the same. In this case, Sandra Bullock plays Loretta Sage, a widowed popular author who has lost her zest for life following the death of her archeologist husband. When her editor/publisher, Beth Hatten (Da Vine Joy Randolph), presses her for the latest installment of her popular series, Loretta complies with minimal enthusiasm. She goes on the book tour with even less relish. She is accompanied on the cross-country marketing binge by Alan Caprison (Channing Tatum), the male model who has been the inspiration for the macho lead on the cover of every one of Loretta s 20 books. What she doesn t realize is that, for all his posing and preening, Alan has a crush on her. The potentially boring tour takes a turn for the adventurous when Loretta is kidnapped by Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe), a billionaire who has discovered The Lost City of D but needs Loretta to translate an ancient manuscript scrap that allegedly reveals the location of a hidden treasure. Initially, Abigail comes across as an affable eccentric but, over time, darker tendencies emerge. Meanwhile, Beth and Alan arrange for a rescue. Alan hires an ex-special ops agent, Jack Trainer (Brad Pitt), to execute Lorretta s extraction. Not long after, with Loretta sprung from Abigail s clutches, she and Alan are forced to pass through an unforgiving jungle to find civilization with a group of grubby henchmen on their trail. Impediments along the way include Alan having a problem with water leeches (resulting in a lingering look at either Tatum s buttocks or those of a body double), Loretta experiencing difficulties climbing in a disco-themed sequin dress, and the chill of the jungle once the sun sets. Alas, while there s pleasure to be had in the interactions between Loretta and Alan and the all-too-short interlude with Brad Pitt is a hoot, the movie s adventure elements are on auto-pilot. The harder co-directors (and brothers) Adam and Aaron Nee lean into the action/thriller aspects, the less engaging things become. Although Daniel Radcliffe does his best to froth at the mouth and act deranged, he s rather ordinary as psychopaths come, and the entire subplot featuring Beth chasing down her missing author could have been excised. It doesn t work   the Lynchian weirdness is jarringly out-of-place. The Lost City may be designed primarily with one demographic in mind (older women), but it will likely work as well for any viewer regardless of sex or age. It s easily digestible and, although some of the less successful elements may try the patience from time-to-time, the companionable chemistry   screwball banter mixed with romantic frisson   between Bullock (who s much better in this sort of part than her more serious outings) and Tatum smooths out many of the rough patches. The gender-flipping of the character roles is fun, although Alan gets to do a little more than stand around and provide eye candy (and he is sufficiently self-aware to recognize that he s the  damsel in distress ). But, while the promise of a real jungle adventure gets as lost as the title city, as a fun throwaway headed quickly to Paramount+, The Lost City is a passable diversion.",DBG_Doc3_TheLostCity,DBG,Comedy,Negative,The Lost City
143,DBG_Doc4_TheLostCity,"'The Lost City' put all the good stuff in the trailer, and not much else Review by Brian Lowry, CNN Kudos to the Paramount marketing department, because every good scene in ""The Lost City"" can be found in the preview trailer, and it's pretty slim pickings beyond that. A romantic-comedy/action vehicle for Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum, the movie's throwback feel is breezy but barely enough to justify ""Lost"" being found. At first blush the derivative streak actually seems almost like an asset, evoking shorthand memories of ""Romancing the Stone,"" another story about a romance novelist forced out of her comfort zone and into an exotic adventure that resembles her windblown stories. The twist here, on its face fertile but not particularly as executed, is that the plot throws her together with the Fabio-like cover model from her 20 books, a muscled fellow named Alan (Tatum), who has harbored thinly veiled feelings for Bullock's widowed Loretta Sage even though she dismisses him as a shallow himbo. The two meet up promoting Loretta's latest book, which she wants to mark the final entry in the series. But her background as an academic has led to her incorporating references to a priceless treasure that garner the attention of a wealthy heir, Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe, a bit of casting that doesn't turn out to be as inspired as it looked), who thinks she's the only person who can help him locate the Hitchcockian MacGuffin. Soon enough, Loretta and Alan are in survival mode on a remote island, trying to evade Fairfax and his minions. While Alan might look the part, he's woefully out of his element, eager to be perceived as a hero in her eyes -- ""I want her to see me as more than a cover model,"" he says, for anyone who missed the point -- but understandably terrified being shot at and chased. As promising as that sounds, the result is for the most part pretty flat. Enlivened briefly by Brad Pitt's cameo as the savvy rescuer that Alan initially enlists, the rest mostly boils down to Bullock and Tatum bantering and bickering, weathering enough near-fatal encounters to create the requisite adrenaline to bring them closer together. Directed by brothers Adam and Aaron Nee, who collaborated on the script with Oren Uziel and Dana Fox, ""The Lost City"" owes its most direct debt to ""Romancing the Stone"" but recalls any number of romantic pairings in exotic locales, a la ""Six Days, Seven Nights."" Yet it's the uninspired writing, more than the general template, that keeps the movie from finding its stride. On the plus side, the scenery's nice, and for those who've already seen ""The Batman"" there's nothing wrong with a little mindless escapism. In that sense, it's not that the movie's bad, but rather given the elements and that aforementioned trailer, that it could have been so much better; instead, they built this ""City"" on a flimsy foundation. ""Jungles eat people like us,"" Loretta tells Alan. Underdeveloped scripts, it turns out, do too.",DBG_Doc4_TheLostCity,DBG,Comedy,Negative,The Lost City
144,DBG_Doc5_TheLostCity,"Don t see The Lost City for the storyline, see it for Sandra and Channing By Jake Wilson The return of the old-fashioned exotic adventure story is one of the more baffling Hollywood trends of the moment, unless it s just a symptom of a collective need to get out of the house. In any case, the cycle continues with Adam and Aaron Nee s The Lost City, basically an off-brand reboot of Romancing the Stone. Sandra Bullock is romantic adventure novelist Loretta Sage, a shut-in who has lost her mojo after the death of her archaeologist husband. Even her fans are less interested in her latest book than in seeing her hunky cover model Alan (Channing Tatum) rip his shirt off. In the meantime, however, the book is drawing attention in other quarters, since it may contain clues to the whereabouts of a fabled treasure on a remote island off the coast of Latin America. (Also on this island is the Lost City of the title, which proves somewhat more peripheral than you d expect.) A few hours into an already disastrous book tour, Loretta is kidnapped and transported to the island, still wearing the sequinned pink jumpsuit insisted on by her publicist (Da Vine Joy Randolph). Alan leaps at the chance to be a hero for real, and soon they re racing for their lives through the jungle, though not at a pace that prevents them from gradually getting to know each other on a more than professional basis.It s all quite sweet, in its cartoonish way. Unlike Loretta, Bullock shows no sign of leaving her comfort zone, nor is she close to matching Kathleen Turner s inventive Romancing the Stone performance. But as an old hand at the romance game in her own right, she capably balances sharpness, warmth and melancholy. The real drawcard is Tatum, paradoxically showing his confidence in his masculinity though his willingness to embrace the traditionally feminine  bimbo  role. In this sense the whole film works on two levels: the outward emphasis on Alan s harmlessness suggests it could be made for mothers to watch with their 12-year-old daughters, despite a handful of risque lines. Similarly tween-friendly is Daniel Radcliffe s comic turn as the pipsqueak villain, driven by fury at having been passed over as heir to his father s media empire (if there s a specific real-life model, I didn t work it out). Brad Pitt presumably picked up an easy couple of million for his peripheral role as a hard-boiled adventurer who speaks in amusing non sequiturs. The jokes in general are hit-and-miss, but more work has been put into them than into the action sequences, which are infrequent and indifferently staged. Cinematographer Jonathan Sela, who shot the first John Wick, hasn t been allowed to bring much to the party: the look is flat and overlit, with obvious shifts between studio sets and the Dominican Republic locations. Ultimately there is not much to recommend The Lost City beyond a degree of unpretentious good nature, plus the appeal of its stars. But depending on your fondness for Bullock and Tatum, that may be enough to make you feel you haven t been robbed.",DBG_Doc5_TheLostCity,DBG,Comedy,Negative,The Lost City
145,DBG_Doc6_TheLostCity," The Lost City  isn t an especially unique film; its premise draws on  Romancing the Stone  and countless other adventure movies. Its punchlines are recognizable from a distance as the volcano dominating the remote island where most of the story takes place. This is a movie you can get a clear sense of from its opening moments, every beat clearly telegraphed. There is, however, a significant amount of comfort and delight in all this familiarity. Directors and co-writers Adam and Aaron Nee understand exactly what their audience wants much like a good romance novelist might and deliver an undeniably charming (and refreshingly IP-free) romantic romp. This is a movie you watch in the theater, with popcorn, then again and again on streaming, with a glass of wine. Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) is a burnt-out romance writer whose grief after the loss of her husband threatens to derail her career. Her disdain for her books is only matched by her dislike of their cover model, Alan (Channing Tatum), a seemingly dim beefcake who indulges her readers at signing events. After an event promoting her latest book, Loretta is abducted by explorer/rich guy Abigail (it s a gender-neutral name, apparently) Fairfax, played by Daniel Radcliffe. Fairfax knows that the lost city from Loretta s book is real, and he wants her to translate some ancient writing that leads to a treasure before a volcano erupts and covers the whole thing. Alan mounts an ill-advised expedition to save Loretta, with help from his meditation guru, Jack (Brad Pitt), and Loretta s beleaguered editor Beth (Da Vine Joy Randolph). Loretta and Alan s eventual romance is unavoidable, but  The Lost City  does a great job exploring the mounting chemistry between Bullock and Tatum s characters. In particular, the movie highlights Alan s emotional intelligence and unwavering support. He may be the kind of guy who refers to Loretta as a  human mummy,  but he also knows she gets cranky without snacks, and that she could use a slightly more sensible pair of shoes traversing all that rocky terrain. Like many a beloved romantic hero, Alan is not only a gorgeous man, he s a man who cares. Tatum is great casting for a role like this on several levels; not only does he look like he belongs on the cover of a romance paperback, he s also an actor who understands his own appeal and has proven time and again that he isn t afraid to play it for laughs. Bullock is also more than happy to play into her character s physical awkwardness and eventual shedding of her prickly exterior it s not exactly unfamiliar territory for her, either. Together, the pair exude fun and a sense of affection that s easy to get caught up in. Other members of the supporting cast, particularly a very welcome Patti Harrison as Loretta s hysterically self-involved social media manager, add bright, bizarre punches of humor to a script that otherwise plays it by the numbers (oddly, this isn t a criticism,  The Lost City  is working with an effective formula). Radcliffe is the only element of the movie that doesn t work quite as well as the rest. His character is the one area where the film tries to change up established archetypes, and the result is that he feels out of place in a story where everyone else comfortably fits into their roles.  The Lost City  may get dinged by some for being formulaic and silly, but it does many things well that are notable. It s bright, both visually and atmospherically. It s an original story, told by filmmakers who get what kind of movie this is. Most importantly, its central relationship displays a real understanding of the emotional sensitivity and vulnerability that make romance attractive as a genre. Ultimately,  The Lost City  is interested in hitting viewers  expectations head on. It does so on a level that may seem obvious, but is done with an amount of care that s sure to hold up to repeat viewings.",DBG_Doc6_TheLostCity,DBG,Comedy,Positive,The Lost City
146,DBG_Doc7_TheLostCity,"The Lost City (Review): Bullock & Tatum Are a Riot in Raucous Romcom The Lost City is a terrific throwback to studio romcoms of the 90s and 00s, with two true-blue movie star performances from Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum. As superhero films strengthened their grip on the industry, one of the first genres for studios to no longer deem a  theatrical necessity  was the romantic comedy. Nowadays, most people get their romcom fix from Netflix (Set it Up, Always Be My Maybe, etc.) but there was a time   not so long ago   when movies like My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Hitch, and Pretty Woman could pair a couple of movie stars (Will Smith, Julia Roberts, etc.) with a creative concept and make nearly $200 million at the domestic box office, packing in crowds like a Marvel movie. Cut to 2022 and, extraordinary exceptions like 2018 s Crazy Rich Asians aside, most romcoms simply can t compete with the IP-driven titles that have theaters in a chokehold; despite being critically acclaimed, 2017 s The Big Sick and 2019 s Long Shot, for instance, barely registered with average audiences. However, that doesn t mean some romcom aficionados aren t still trying to keep the genre alive. Just this February, we saw the release of the Jennifer Lopez s Marry Me (co-starring Loki s Owen Wilson as her mismatched love interest), and the multihyphenate even has another due for June   Shotgun Wedding, co-starring Transformers  Josh Duhamel. But, before that, this month brings us the long-awaited The Lost City, which not only gives Sandra Bullock yet another starring role in one of the genres she s most famous for (While You Were Sleeping, The Proposal, you know the rest) but also, along with last month s Dog, serves as co-star Channing Tatum s triumphant return to live-action cinema, having been absent since 2017 s Kingsman: The Golden Circle. On paper, The Lost City looks like the kind of thing that used to be Hollywood s bread-and-butter   a old-fashioned  movie movie  based around an original idea and led by two mega stars with clearly defined public personas who lure in audiences despite the lack of IP. And, in execution, it s every bit the exuberant big-screen entertainment you d expect it to be. We start on Loretta Sage (Bullock), a dissatisfied, middle-aged author who, following the death of her husband and her inability to publish a book on their archeological findings, turned to writing romance-adventure novels centered around a beautiful and brooding fictional hero named Dash (who is given a vibrant visage by clueless cover model Alan Caprison, played by Tatum). But now, Loretta s found herself in a rut; aside from rarely (if ever) leaving her house, she s grown disenchanted with the series as a whole, and she wants this latest book   which she s about to leave for a book tour on   to be her last. That doesn t sit well with Alan (who relies on this job since he can t really do anything else) and her brassy publicist Beth (Da Vine Joy Randolph, of Dolemite Is My Name and Office Christmas Party), but before they can voice too many frustrations, Loretta is kidnapped by Abigail Fairfax (Harry Potter s Daniel Radcliffe), a bizarre billionaire who believes that the lost city in her new book is real and that, based on her descriptions, she knows where it is. Against all odds, Alan sets off to save her, but he soon finds out that this task will be a lot tougher   and far more absurd   than anticipated. First, praise must be paid to Seth Gordon (of Horrible Bosses and Identify Thief fame) for coming up with such a classic romcom concept and screenwriters Oren Uziel (22 Jump Street, Mortal Kombat), Dana Fox (Cruella, Isn t It Romantic), and the Nee brothers (who also direct here) for shaping it into such a snappy and side-splitting script, as this is exactly the kind of creative inventiveness needed to keep any project that isn t tied into a cinematic universe prospering today. No one is going to accuse The Lost City of  rewriting the rulebook on romcoms,  but it didn t have to! What we ve got here is a thrill of a throwback   a ingenious idea (a romance novelist who used to be an archeologist being used to find hidden treasure based on scientific knowledge she slips into her books while her moronic cover model is the only one who can save her from sudden doom) paired with two powerhouse performers (Bullock and Tatum), and sometimes, that s all you need. These types of films used to be a dime a dozen in theaters, but their lack of prevalence these days makes The Lost City s presence all the more special   and the experience all the more exciting, given how little we get to enjoy anything like this anymore. There are nits to be picked with the plot here-or-there   the story gets off to a slow start before the script shifts the cast to the island, Radcliffe s antagonist is a tad underwritten, and, at nearly two hours, there are certainly scenes that could be condensed or shortened to allow for a tighter runtime   but, in all honesty, you ll be too busy basking in the radiant charm of Bullock and Tatum s crackling chemistry or having a riot with their raucous repartee that these minor gripes hardly even register when all is said and done. The script is strong enough (especially when it comes to crafting sincerely comical setpieces) and the star power is so significant that you re almost always having a good time regardless, especially since there s such a sustained sense of energy and enthusiasm throughout   something that also translates to the shockingly impressive action sequences, skillfully shot by the Nee brothers, which allows the film to truly check every genre box. There s something for everyone! Bullock is such a pro at  the romcom thing  at this point that she could practically do it in her sleep, and even though the writing for Loretta somewhat makes her feel like a  wet blanket  at the start of the movie, Bullock eventually comes into her own as the character and showcases her signature synthesis of sarcasm and sentimentality. Still, it s Tatum who undoubtedly steals the show, partially on account of how sensational it is to see him killing it on a big screen again, but also because he knows how to harness his inherent himbo energy unlike almost any other conventionally attractive male actor working today, with priceless line-readings in practically every single scene. Brad Pitt   in an utterly exceptional extended cameo as Alan s tenacious trainer, who takes it upon himself to help out   additionally once again proves why he s one of the most reliable and versatile movie stars to ever exist, leaving a lasting impression on the film and audiences despite only starring in a ten-minute stretch of the story. Randolph, still awaiting her own leading role that is hopefully coming someday soon, serves up one blistering barb after another, beat after beat (receiving a hilarious subplot of her own) while I Think You Should Leave s Patti Harrison also livens up the proceedings in a limited role, and Radcliffe relishes  breaking bad.  It s hard to imagine a more perfect movie to help welcome people back to the theaters who still held out throughout 2021 than The Lost City. Sure, it doesn t have a superhero s name in the title, but it s as thrilling a theatrical experience as anything you ll get from the MCU, packing in a plethora of genres and contorting its high concept into enthralling cinematic escapism that has something to offer everyone. It may not be the most surprising or subversive story around, but thanks to a still-sturdy script and the ever-reliable strength of megawatt movie stars like Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum, it doesn t need to be, as it finds the fun to be had in this fable in spite of its familiarity, and it s hard to imagine anyone resisting its comprehensive charms.",DBG_Doc7_TheLostCity,DBG,Comedy,Positive,The Lost City

So amongst the many challenges faced by The Lost City is finding a way to take this familiar premise   one where previous examples like Romancing the Stone remain pretty iconic   and make it fresh. Fortunately, directors Adam Nee and Aaron Nee manage to find just the right balance between action, comedy, and romance to make all three work harmoniously together, while playing with a team of all-stars who make the material sing. The Lost City didn t have to go so hard to be so successful, but the extra effort is what ensures that this film might actually endure in our memories, unlike other, more forgettable attempts at this story. That Cast: Sandra Bullock is one of our great living physical comedians, though she doesn t get nearly enough recognition for this facet of her stardom. So, if nothing else, watching her contend with her true enemy in this film   the sparkly pink jumpsuit that she wears for a good percentage of it   is a wonderful reminder of this fact. It s not just the fact that she s wearing it, but how it affects her physicality: One of the film s earliest jokes is just Bullock in that jumpsuit, trying to get onto a stool, and it kills. Oh and also, she deserves an Oscar just for navigating nearly the entire film in heels. Even when the film (accidentally or on purpose, it s hard to say) references her iconic stumble from Miss Congeniality, it s still a treat to see how Bullock takes these tools and wields them like Chaplin with his cane and bowler hat. The movie is far bigger than just what Loretta s wearing, of course. The ensemble in general is packed with standouts: Radcliffe tears into the role of deranged billionaire with glee, adding just enough  spoiled little rich boy  to make it comedically fascinating. Da Vine Joy Randolph, as Loretta s book agent-turned-attempted rescuer Beth, is a lot of fun, and Bowen Yang and Patti Harrison show up in small roles that they absolutely slaughter; Harrison in particular has a few line readings that should be studied by science, they re so good. Chemistry Test: While the trailer for The Lost City does spoil a few big bits of comedy   including the appearance of Brad Pitt as a far more savvy adventurer than Alan   the majority of the film still manages to feature some surprises, especially as Loretta and Alan grapple with their circumstances as well as their dawning awareness of who the other person really is. What s most fascinating about The Lost City is how it plays with the power balance of Loretta and Alan s relationship, as Bullock s chemistry with Tatum isn t dependent on her being put down or disgraced (well, beyond the indignities of wearing that pink jumpsuit). And while he s torn off on this quest to rescue her, Alan doesn t prove his value to her as a hero with big action heroics   instead, he connects with her through honestly and vulnerability. It s an unconventional romance in some ways, but it works because of how it celebrates the quirks of both star personas, Tatum in particular shining. The Verdict: Any romance novel fan will have plenty to nitpick in The Lost City, but while some of the details might be inaccurate, the film does capture what makes the genre so compelling to so many   while also calling out any attempts to cast negativity onto a genre that doesn t deserve that kind of treatment. Loretta might scoff at her work, but as Alan tells her,  How can I be embarrassed by something that makes people happy?  This isn t a perfect film, but hopefully those involved with making The Lost City believe in that message   because they have nothing to be embarrassed about. This movie will make an awful lot of people happy.",DBG_Doc8_TheLostCity,DBG,Comedy,Positive,The Lost City
148,DBG_Doc9_TheLostCity,"Review:  The Lost City  almost strikes gold at SXSWBy Caroline Siede Austin, TX - Sandra Bullock made a telling quip at the SXSW premiere of her new comedy, ""The Lost City."" She thanked the Paramount reps in the audience for supporting the film before adding, ""You didn t trust us completely, but you trusted us."" The joke helped snapped into focus a feeling of compromise that hangs over the film, which was originally meant to be called ""The Lost City of D"" before the title was softened to the more generic ""The Lost City""   perhaps the first sign of trouble in paradise. Indeed, it s not hard to imagine a version of this story that s a raunchier, more subversive R-rated comedy instead of a generically palatable PG-13 rated one. As is, it feels more like it should ve been called ""The Lost City of ADR,"" given the copious amounts of additional dialogue replacement that fill up just about every moment of silence with an inelegant joke or clunky transition. (That s often a sign of a movie that was rejiggered in post to satisfy anxious studio execs or unhappy focus groups.) Still, given those parameters, it s a wonder that the film emerges as the relatively enjoyable romp it is   compromises and all. ""The Lost City"" is a good-not-great adventure romance in the vein of ""Romancing The Stone,"" and in an era of Hollywood in which those kinds of movies are few and far between, perhaps we re just lucky to have this one at all. ""The Lost City of D"" is at least still the in-universe name of the new book from lonely romance novelist Loretta Sage (Bullock), who reluctantly agrees to promote it alongside her lunkheaded cover model Alan (Channing Tatum)   better known as her dashing protagonist Dash McMahon. Loretta is frustrated that Alan s abs keeping stealing the spotlight, while Alan is frustrated that he keeps putting his foot in his mouth in front of Loretta when all he wants to do is convey how much he respects and admires her. So when Loretta is kidnapped by an eccentric billionaire (Daniel Radcliffe) who wants to enlist her to help find the actual Lost City of D, Alan spies a prime opportunity to prove his mettle and rescue her   or at least to recruit a highly trained black ops agent played by Brad Pitt to take him along on the rescue mission. Pitt s involvement is another thing that feels like it was meant to play as a big surprise cameo, but has now been heavily featured in the film s marketing campaign. Thankfully, there s still plenty of subversive fun to be had with the way the film deploys him as a foil for the burgeoning connection between Loretta and Alan. Pitt s Jack Trainer is exactly the sort of ruggedly confident hero Alan wishes he was in real life. And when circumstances conspire to leave Alan and Loretta stranded alone, it quickly becomes clear just how little their respective experiences as a writer and model have prepared them to survive in the jungle. Of course, the joy of adventure romances like ""Romancing the Stone"" and ""The African Queen"" is feeling stuck right alongside the leads as the adrenaline of their adventure fuels the throes of passion. And in its best moments ""The Lost City"" locks into that tone, as Bullock and Tatum banter about the ethics of taking out a baddie or almost lose their lunch over leeches. This is as good a showcase for Bullock s physical comedy skills as she s ever had. Whether struggling to perch on a stool in a purple sequined jumpsuit or trying to slither out of a hammock, she s got a silent film star s knack for telegraphing a joke across her face as she wildly contorts her body   which is why it s so annoying that the film keeps circling back to those generic ADR-ed one-liners, as if afraid the audience will lose interest the second someone isn t speaking. Tatum s the real revelation, however, returning to the himbo comedic roots that made him such a winning romantic lead in his breakout turn in the 2006 teen comedy, ""She s The Man."" To varying degrees, most of Tatum s roles since then have taken advantage of the contrast between his hunky good lucks and his inherent puppy dog charm. But these two rom-coms in particular dial up the comedic softness in a way that s incredibly endearing. In place of a classic oil-and-water screwball comedy dynamic, Alan is hopelessly in love with closed-off Loretta, no matter how coldly she treats him   a unique kind of romantic fantasy of its own. Yet despite Bullock and Tatum s considerable charms, ""The Lost City"" is bloated with ideas instead of streamlined with rom-com passion, as cutaways to needless subplots keep deflating the romantic tension. It s hard to blame the cast   Radcliffe is a hoot as an arch baddie and Da'Vine Joy Randolph and Patti Harrison (playing two members of Loretta's team) remain two of the funniest comedic actors working today. But more isn't always more when it comes to zeroing in on a story that needed more heart and way less plot. ""The Lost City"" too often swerves towards the generic catch-all appeal of a big action comedy instead of zeroing in on the rom-com stuff it does best. It adds up to a comedic effort that s not bad, exactly. It s just that when a movie is this close to being great, you wish it could ve kept searching for treasure instead of settling for staying back at base camp.",DBG_Doc9_TheLostCity,DBG,Comedy,Positive,The Lost City
149,DBG_Doc10_TheLostCity," The Lost City  Review: Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum Are Cute Together in Guilty-Pleasure Treasure Movie Flipping the gender roles slightly, this  Romancing the Stone  redux suggests you can have your beefcake and do whatever you want with it. By Peter Debruge You know studio movies are in a rut when, amid endless Spider-Bat sequels, you find yourself longing for the likes of such escapist 1980s offerings as  Romancing the Stone  and  King Solomon s Mines.  I can t be the only one who s been craving a good old-fashioned treasure hunt, where the leads throw sparks and the ladies  makeup never smudges, no matter how close to the volcano they get. After a long stretch without such a big-screen Hollywood adventure movie (at least, not one without ties to a video game or theme park ride),  The Lost City  makes for welcome counter-programming. The story was producer Seth Gordon s idea, but credit siblings Adam and Aaron Nee (who tested the waters with their Mark Twain-inspired  Band of Robbers ) for sprucing up the formula, while Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum supply the chemistry. Bullock plays brainy romance novelist Loretta Sage, who s lost her inspiration since the death of her husband, an archaeologist who might have been onto something. Her once-scorching potboilers barely simmer these days, and she s seriously thinking of killing off Dash, the long-haired, Fabio-looking Lothario who graces the covers of all her books. She can hardly stand Alan (Tatum), the dum-dum male model who embodies Dash, dismissing him as a mouth-breathing  body wash commercial.  But Alan s a hit with the ladies at book-signing events, and lucky for her, he sorta-kinda likes Loretta   enough to go traipsing halfway across the Atlantic after she s kidnapped by a wealthy weirdo named Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). A billionaire with an insecurity complex, Fairfax is convinced that Loretta knows the location of the Crown of Fire, a long-lost diamond headdress described in her latest book, and he flies her to a remote tropical island to help him find it. Maybe then Daddy will love him. Alan, who isn t the brightest, has the wisdom to enlist an old acquaintance, lethal ex-Navy SEAL Jack Trainer (Brad Pitt), who typically works solo. But Alan insists on tagging along, and together these two dreamy dudes follow the signal from Loretta s watch to the middle of the Atlantic, where Abigail has located the  Lost City of D.  To Alan s chagrin, Loretta seems a lot more interested in Jack once she s rescued, although the adventure s only just begun. (Pitt, who provides the kind of scene-stealing cameo Tatum did in last summer s  Free Guy,  doesn t stick around for long.) Free from captivity but still stuck on the island, Loretta realizes that maybe she could figure out where the Crown of Fire is hidden. Pursued by Abigail s henchmen, she and Alan make their way through the jungle, navigating nearly all the usual pitfalls of the genre   minus bone-in-the-nose natives.  The Lost City  evokes movies that can seem outrageously insensitive when revisited today, while avoiding the most wince-inducing clich s. One reason I ve been craving a fresh  Romancing the Stone -like movie is that I happened to revisit the original during the early days of COVID and winced at the overtly racist stereotypes (not to mention the unconvincing Mexico-as-South-America locations).  The Lost City  was shot in the Dominican Republic, and though there s a whole lot of CG involved, it s still great to see movie stars running around real jungles, especially after being cooped up indoors for two years. Even at the movie s masks-on SXSW Film Festival premiere,  The Lost City  was a breath of fresh air: the kind of breezy two-hour getaway that doesn t take itself too seriously, delivering screwball banter between Bullock and Tatum   a guilty-pleasure treasure hunt that pretends to be more progressive than it really is by alternating between who s saving whom. Loretta Sage is no feminist icon   she runs around the island in high heels and a glittering fuchsia jumpsuit   but at least the movie lets her keep her clothes on, whereas Alan s constantly losing his. Ditching the usual bimbo-in-peril routine of movies like  Six Days, Seven Nights,  the movie focuses more on Dash s cleavage than it does hers, and there s even a gratuitous leech-removal scene that reveals more of the actor than  Magic Mike  did. Tatum knows what his fans want, and so does Bullock, leaning into the kind of physical comedy that s been her forte since  Miss Congeniality.  A bit in which she s wheelbarrowed through the jungle while strapped to a chair, as pyrotechnics go off around her, revives the goofiness factor that s been missing from CG-dominated action movies.  The Lost City  won t be nominated for any Oscars, but it repeats what Spielberg and Lucas did for  Raiders of the Lost Ark,  mining a century-old genre for inspiration and polishing those tropes for a new generation. A subplot involving Loretta s publisher Beth (Da Vine Joy Randolph) makes room for a few people of color (including Oscar Nu ez as an offbeat accomplice), and it s a nice surprise to see Radcliffe playing against type, even if the movie doesn t quite know how to wrap up the supporting characters  stories. (A bonus scene tucked into the end credits essentially invalidates one of the movie s best gags.) The result can feel a little rickety in places, but the Nee brothers   who share screenplay credit with Oren Uziel and Dana Fox   have punched it up with off-color jokes, looped over moments when the characters  mouths are off-camera. In this and myriad other ways,  The Lost City  proves they do in fact make  em like they used to.",DBG_Doc10_TheLostCity,DBG,Comedy,Positive,The Lost City
20,NSM_Doc1_TheToxicAvenger,"French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu published Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste in 1979, one of the first major studies on taste as a social construction. He argued that good taste was  asserted purely negatively, by the refusal of other tastes.  After one scrapes away the abject horror and disgust experienced in a visceral or ideologically negative reaction, the remainder must be the product of good taste. But only the offended tastebuds of a distinct, mostly bourgeois group implant the good taste canon, according to Bourdieu, and thus, these so-called elites draw the acceptable boundaries of mainstream culture. Cult films rally against good taste, defying the sociopolitical, economic, and cultural elitism of tastemakers. Such bad taste fare transgresses the conventional consciousness and dominant ideology. And there once was a time, established in the 1920s with the emergence of Classical Hollywood and lasting through the early 1960s, when a prevailing cultural outlook permeated the cinema. From the 1960s until the dawn of the Digital Age, cult films could still be transgressive in the face of a perceived uniformity in American culture. But as the overall culture continues to fragment and cults progress into subcultures, which in turn become entirely independent of one another, cult film has transformed into a commercially proven and exploitable market for cult-style entertainment today. As a result of this transformation, The Toxic Avenger, released in 1984 by Troma Entertainment, seems almost cute today.  Bringing up French sociology and the fragmentation of cultural values in relation to The Toxic Avenger is not meant to suggest any feeling of loss or regret over the near eradication of the elitism of good taste in contemporary times. In an effort to preserve itself, the social hierarchy of good taste throughout history has suppressed countless artists from expressing themselves openly, forcing them into cult modes of exhibition. Rather, my initial remarks are meant to deplore the normalization and commercialization of transgressiveness in cinema. Antiauthoritarian cultists have become so commonplace that they have transformed into subcultures able to inhabit entirely different spaces without overlap, whether they exist online or in the real world. Their autonomy dissolves the oppositional relationship of good and bad taste, which has both positive and negative effects. On the positive end, it grants the creators of transgressive art a wider audience that supports it both financially, in terms of establishing a reliable marketplace for their works, and existentially, in that their audience has been demarcated by midnight madness screenings, web forums, and countless other subcultural sites. On the negative end, the institutionalization of cult films in pop-culture has robbed them of their potency, rebellion, and essential alternativeness cult films have become just another option on the search bar.  the-toxic-avengerIn a way, my belief in the death of truly transgressive cult cinema began with The Toxic Avenger, as evidenced in the movie s modest franchise success. This  Troma Team Release  was shot in New Jersey for a meager $500 thousand by Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz, the founders of Troma, and over the subsequent decades, its brand has earned them millions. After its meager premiere in 1984, the movie cultivated a small but loyal audience before its expanded release in 1986. Its profits led to three diminishing sequels The Toxic Avenger Part II (1989), The Toxic Avenger Part III: The Last Temptation of Toxie (1989), and Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV (2000). There was a children s Saturday morning cartoon, Toxic Crusaders, made in 1991 in the wake of the popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated series after which mutants born of toxic waste became mainstream. Troma then spread their intellectual property across comic books, action figures, books, video games, and a popular 2008 musical. All of this derived from a sordid little freakshow-of-a-movie that bears curious similarities to a Marvel Comic.  Banking on a counterculture attuned to sex, blood, and filth, Kaufman and Herz started their production and distribution company in 1974. Troma produced and still makes low-budget titles that could only aspire to the schlocky quality of Roger Corman s cheapo New World Pictures movies. Back in the 1970s and 1980s, Troma titles first screened on New York s 42nd Street, better known as The Deuce, where grindhouse theaters ran the era s most salacious material for an underground market of weirdoes, renegades, perverts, mavericks, and outsiders. There, Kaufman s name was already well established for a string of X-rated movies. Under the Troma label, Kaufman and Herz branched out into controversial splatterfests and raunchy sex comedies, with titles like Bloodsucking Freaks (1976), Squeeze Play (1979), and Surf Nazis Must Die (1987). Nothing was sacred; taboo subjects provided the basic ingredients of Troma s nasty spoofs. And along with similar production companies of their ilk, Troma s cheesy, trashy releases offended so-called good taste and engendered an audience devoted to their cultish output.  Watching The Toxic Avenger is not an experience rooted in empathy. Today it would be called a meta-experience in which the text is less important than the extratextual commentary on display a layer of satire that involves the viewer outside of narrative, where the filmmakers wink at their audience through every absurdist plot machination or debased character detail. The story, however thin, follows Melvin Ferd (Mark Torgl), an annoying, unsympathetic spaz who mops up the sweat of elitist assholes at the health club in Tromaville, the  toxic waste dumping capital of the world.  Melvin is perpetually bullied by a group of fitness-obsessed beautiful people, led by the  stressed  Bozo (Gary Schneider), whose gang of hyper-zonked hit-and-run killers play their own version of Death Race 2000 in a sadomasochistic game. After a cruel prank that involves a tutu and a sheep, Melvin falls into an open vat of radioactive sludge, causing him to melt and combust into flames in a bubbly metamorphosis. He emerges as  the monster hero,  a local celebrity who rescues victims from Tromaville s criminal gangs using a cartoon-inspired brand of violence (note his punching bag routine on the faces and groins of his enemies).  the-toxic-avenger-poster-2Kaufman and Herz s treatment of the villains is telling, as they re portrayed as racist, child murdering, drunk driving, and churchgoing degenerates that beat up elderly women and run over helmeted adolescents with their vehicles. Their police force is run by a German-accented officer prone to latent Nazi gestures, while Tromaville s officials either have terrible combovers or appear morbidly obese. This mockery of cultural elites and authority figures reeks of Troma s particular antiauthority streak, but not even the good guys escape unscathed. Melvin, later dubbed  Toxie,  has transformed into a melty-eyed rage monster who lives in the city dump, although, hilariously, he has the buttery voice of Kenneth Kessler. Toxie soon rescues the blind, optimistic Sara (Andree Maranda) from another of Tromaville s gangs (after they kill her seeing eye dog in a moment that friends to animals will want to unsee), and they quickly begin a love affair. Meanwhile, her sightlessness is the subject of cheap pratfalls and gags. Together, they have silly, endearing romance and not without an eww factor during their lovemaking.  That the relationship between Toxie and Sara resembles the one between Marvel Comics  Fantastic Four superhero Ben Grimm, aka The Thing, and his blind love interest Alicia Masters, is no coincidence. Kaufman and Herz draw from a wealth of Marvel influences, chief among them the phenomenon of average citizens being endowed with super-strength from an otherwise deadly source. The Thing, along with his three compatriots, was imbued with superpowers from the radiation in a cosmic ray storm; Spider-Man gained his abilities from a radioactive spider; the X-Men were granted abilities through mutations; Daredevil was blinded by a radioactive substance. Most of all, The Toxic Avenger borrows aspects of its form from The Incredible Hulk television series (1977-1982), about Dr. Bruce Banner s shifts into a green bodybuilder after he s exposed to gamma radiation. Both the Hulk and Toxie are played by muscle-bound actors (Lou Ferrigno, Mitch Cohen) augmented by a few cheap prosthetics, both roar their way through street-level battles, and their public both fears and celebrates them. With its foundation so closely mirroring that of a Marvel superhero, no wonder The Toxic Avenger catapulted Troma from an underground production company into a commercially viable distributor.  Of course, no one would mistake The Toxic Avenger for today s blockbusters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Kaufman and Herz may adopt a Marvel Comic setup, but this foundation is used to unleash a series of base jokes, C-grade effects, and over-the-top violence in the face good taste. Toxie tears arms out of a bad guy s sockets, pokes eyes out of a gangmember s head, rips the intestines from the fat mayor s stomach, delivers beatings to a man s groin, smushes a woman in a dry cleaning press and then stuffs her in a dryer, sears a goon s hands in a deep frier, and conducts no end of atrocious acts that, in any other scenario, would be seen as horrific. However, given the intentionally comic-booky tone of the movie, every normal reaction contains another layer that appropriately mutates it into an unlikely, pleasantly rebellious one. Kaufman and Herz don t stop at violence, either. Sexuality becomes a twisted affair in the movie, with a woman in Bozo s crew masturbating to pictures of a dead child s corpse, the presence of 12-year-old white slaves, and the gross-out factor of Toxie and Sara in bed. Even the aural experience of The Toxic Avenger betrays the acceptable as, typical of Troma releases, every line of dialogue is shouted at an abrasive decibel. Responses of horror and aversion are replaced by humor and glee it s a celebration of its own affronts to cultural sensitivities and the outsider status of such baseness. Nevertheless, the movie isn t about inclusivity for those not accepted as normal, given its moments of homophobia and racism against Asian cultures.  But watching The Toxic Avenger isn t about literalism or taking the material seriously as a text; it s about identifying with Troma s defiance of good taste and low culture, therein celebrating its excessive forms of deviancy in all their many violations. The typical aesthetic definitions of good art, such as beauty and meaning, become the target, and the subversion itself becomes the movie s cult value. The system of taste a social construction shaped by the preeminent moral and class systems of culture is thus redefined and liberated through an experience like The Toxic Avenger. However, given the omnipresence of counter-cultural movies, or faux cult films that have sought to exploit or commercialize cult audiences (see Repo! The Genetic Opera), cultism has resulted in baseline subcultures that no longer disobey, infringe, or offend as part of an oppositional relationship. They have simply erected subcultural boundaries, inside of which deviance and bad taste become the norm and, furthermore, have no antithetical cultural exchange value. And so, while The Toxic Avenger once stood as a cinematic act of grotesque hilarity and rebellion, somewhere between its many sequels and its musical adaptation, the movie has become almost commonplace in the normalization of the cult film phenomenon. Regardless, it s no less entertaining for its neutered lack of transgressiveness.",NSM_Doc1_TheToxicAvenger,NSM,Action,Positive,The Toxic Avenger
21,NSM_Doc2_TheToxicAvenger,"1984's ""The Toxic Avenger"" is the movie that put Troma Entertainment on the map. Previously employed as a distribution machine for titillation comedies, Troma hit pay dirt when they switched their focus to silly splatter efforts and horror pictures, finding a rabid audience who couldn't get enough of their specialized brand of winky mayhem. ""The Toxic Avenger"" is the prototype for subsequent Troma endeavors, mixing a bewildering cocktail of one-liners and ultraviolence in a production that actually desires to make audiences laugh, even while it kills a kid and a dog, and points a shotgun at a baby. Still, the earnestness of the feature is amazing, always working to find a note of absurdity to molest as directors Michael Herz and Lloyd Kaufman (billed here as ""Samuel Weil"") bathe the screen in blood, nudity, and slapstick, funneled into a superhero spoof with a vague environmental message. 30 years after its initial release and ""The Toxic Avenger"" still manages to trigger disgust and a handful of laughs, representing not only a key Troma financial victory, but it's quite possibly their finest original work.  Melvin (Mark Torgl) is a hopeless weakling working as a janitor at the Tromaville Health Club, where he mops floors and is subjected to constant bullying from its customers, including Bozo (Gary Schneider) and Slug (Robert Prichard), and their girlfriends, Julie (Cindy Manion) and Wanda (Jennifer Babtist). When a prank goes horribly wrong, Melvin jumps into a barrel of toxic waste, with the resulting mutation turning him into a powerful monster with strong moral values. Out to help the fine folks in Tromaville, the Toxic Avenger (Mitch Cohen) is transformed into a hero, a development that irritates Mayor Belgoody (Pat Ryan Jr.), whose corrupt ways are threatened by this new arrival. As Toxie takes a blind girlfriend in Sara (Andree Maranda), the melted savior is marked for death by Mayor Belgoody, threatening the future safety of the beleaguered community.  ""The Toxic Avenger"" has a weird joyfulness that's infectious, even while it stages ghastly deaths and dismemberments. Kaufman and Herz construct a rather effective silent comedy in the midst of all the brutality, with the picture playing just as effectively with the sound shut off. With a cast that wildly gesticulates with every line reading, broad physical comedy, and a hulking, deformed hero, it's fairly easy to follow the feature without hearing it, as it periodically reaches Vaudeville-style shenanigans. It's not a tasteful endeavor (maybe babies should be spared the magic of moviemaking), but it has a defined spirit that carries the adventure from beginning to end, stopping occasionally to assess character motivations and explore the romance between Toxie and Sara. Horrible, and I mean horrible stuff happens in ""The Toxic Avenger,"" but rarely does the effort sit around and wallow in ugliness, always on to the next bit of awful it can manipulate into horror and comedy.  Herz and Kaufman serve up quite a buffet of incidents in the feature, challenging screenwriter Joe Ritter to piece together a coherent take on a superhero origin story (he almost succeeds too). There's Bozo and his points-based system of hit-and-run homicide, Mayor Belgoody and his panic to bring down Toxie and preserve his comfortable way of life, and the general activity within the health club, which is apparently a haven for public humiliations, drug dealing, and sauna masturbation experiences. ""The Toxic Avenger"" is dusted with cocaine, soaked in blood, and teeming with excess, reaching its zenith with a mid-movie showdown set in a taco restaurant, where Toxie busts up a robbery, removing arms and deep-frying hands in the process of cleaning up criminal filth (another crook is turned into a human milkshake). If there's any scene that highlights the functional marriage of sick and silly, it's this confrontation. The production also fills ""The Toxic Avenger"" with impressive stunt work, with bodies crashing into cars, jumping out of buildings, and set ablaze, generating an impressive smashmouth tone of surprise as this low-budget picture manufactures a few honest thrills during its run time. There's unexpected bigness to the effort, an accomplishment that extends to make-up work, which is credible considering limited resources, and brain-squishing sequences supply their intended ick.",NSM_Doc2_TheToxicAvenger,NSM,Action,Positive,The Toxic Avenger
22,NSM_Doc3_TheToxicAvenger,"A mild-mannered janitor is transformed into a mutated  Monster Hero  and sets out to clean up the town of Tromaville, New Jersey.  When looking back in the annals of Troma Entertainment, there is one film that you simply cannot ignore. A film that turned a company around and gave them a mascot that would last them to this day   The Toxic Avenger.  Despite The Toxic Avenger being the turning point for Troma where they decided to solely focus on making horror movies, there is a lot to be admired in the film in terms of comedy. Although very cheesy and hack, The Toxic Avenger is a very funny movie that can easily make you laugh out loud 6 or 7 times. From its incredibly silly premise to its caricature heroes and villains, this is a film that slides more into the comedy side of the scale.  Alright, let s get the main points out of the way shall we? It seems preposterous for complaining about the quality of The Toxic Avenger in terms of filmmaking given Troma s history and stupidly low budgets, but there is a lot wrong with the movie. The editing is awful, the acting is horrendous, the pacing is off and the story is pretty badly told. But when watching the movie, you get the impression that all of these flaws are intentional. When you have a plot line this ridiculous, characters that are so over the top and creatively exaggerated death scenes, it s very easy to forgive the film for its amateurish mishaps.    While all of the above remains true, The Toxic Avenger deserves credit for making a lot out of nothing. Despite the film s super low budget, they manage to have heads being crushed, people on fire, guts being ripped out, big stunts, car crashes and explosions   all of which are done with beautiful on-set effects and not a shot of CGI in sight. The prosthetics on The Toxic Avenger himself do leave a bit to be desired, but when everything around him is so amazingly crafted it seems so insignificant. There is a lot to be said for these low budget horror movies of the 1980s and their ability to take some spaghetti and grey paint and make it looks like a dog has had been gutted by a shotgun.  The Toxic Avenger is a fun film, there is no doubt about it. But sadly its poor filmmaking has left it looking somewhat dated to those who aren t so easy to buy into low budget horrors. I mentioned in my Troma history piece that for the last few years Lloyd Kaufman has been working towards a Toxic Avenger remake (which is sadly rumoured to be PG-13) but the question as always stands   is there any need?    I do think that film would benefit somewhat from a 21st century update but feel it could take away some of that magic that makes The Toxic Avenger such a joy to watch. Because the film is so campy, silly and over the top, it s actually kind of brilliant. With shiny effects, good prosthetics and better editing, the film could feel forced and phony which is not what The Toxic Avenger needs. It would be like giving the Adam West Batman TV show a 21st century makeover but keeping the themes and tone the same. It was a show of its era and probably belongs there   just as The Toxic Avenger does.  I love The Toxic Avenger and even have some love for its lesser sequels. If you re a fan of schlocky horror, gory effects, juvenile humour and bat-poop-crazy plot you will also love this movie. It s a whole lot of fun and there is much to be enjoyed so long as you can look past its simple flaws. I hope that Arrow Films give the film and Toxie the recognition it deserves just as they have done with tomorrow s releases.

And deservedly so, as Troma have been delighting and sickening genre fans in equal measure for over 40 years now so who can begrudge Mr. Kaufman a little recognition? However, Troma s films have a certain style about them that doesn t always sit right with audiences not in on the joke, and 1984 s The Toxic Avenger is probably the most well-known and possibly definitive Troma release of them all.  The plot is quite simple and straightforward, especially if you ve ever seen The Incredible Hulk, from which The Toxic Avenger borrows heavily. Wimpy Melvin Junko (Mark Torgl) is the cleaner at the local gym where he is ridiculed and bullied by the patrons. After getting humiliated in front of all the locals, Melvin falls into a drum of toxic waste and mutates into the Toxic Avenger, a huge crime-fighting superbeast with freakish strength and a mission to stop as many bullies as he can.  So it s the standard superhero formula but given the Troma treatment, which means wacky characters, slapstick comedy, gooey special effects and totally gratuitous nudity. But unlike a lot of Troma films The Toxic Avenger isn t totally mean-spirited and allows you to actually like somebody in it, unlike, say, Class of Nuke  Em High where even the so-called  heroes  are unsympathetic and annoying. Toxie (as he will become to be known) manages to get a girlfriend   blind, of course   and their interactions provide a lot of genuine comedy amongst all of the head-squashing and arse-burning; it may be a simple joke but seeing Toxie get hit in the nuts by a flying champagne cork launched by a blind woman is still funny, and those scenes add a little bit of charm to a film that probably shouldn t really have any.  Because at its heart The Toxic Avenger is still a Troma film the OTT violence and gore comes first, and compared to a lot of other Troma titles The Toxic Avenger does pretty well on that front as, despite the slapstick nature with which it is dealt out, it all looks very impressive, although if you re a dog lover you may take issue with a certain scene. Another scene has a young boy knocked off his bike by the local bullies and then has his head run over into a bloody pulp   that s the kind of level we re dealing with   although the scene where the same bullies beat up an old lady for no reason will make you chuckle, even though you know you shouldn t, which is probably Troma s defining characteristic.  Overall, The Toxic Avenger is a shed-load of fun that is never less than totally entertaining. Is it a  good  film? Not especially   this is Troma after all, and Troma films aren t subject to the same criticisms as  normal  films   but as far as superhero origin stories go it hits the ground running and has very little fat on it. The gore is great, the acting is crap, you ll laugh, you ll cry and you may even gasp   but you ll have fun, even though you ll hate yourself afterwards.",NSM_Doc4_TheToxicAvenger,NSM,Action,Positive,The Toxic Avenger
24,NSM_Doc5_TheToxicAvenger,"Last month for No Surrender Cinema I reviewed the Cannon Films  ode to street culture, Rappin ; a movie that was heavy on the hip hop, but light on on the action.  I can guarantee you that the March edition of NSC will more than make up for it.  Get ready for a review full of death, dismemberment, bloodshed, and splatter as I cover one of the ultimate cult classics in cinema history.  I m talking of course about The Toxic Avenger!  Odds are strong that even if you re not the most avid moviegoer, you ve at least heard of The Toxic Avenger.  What was originally conceived by Troma head Lloyd Kaufman to be a horror film set in a health club (the very appropriately named Health Club Horror) morphed into something more along the way, and the final product became the breakout film for Troma Studios.  Kaufman and co. had previously relied on procuring the rights to cheapie flicks with stars who went on to become big names, and their in-house productions were predominantly goofy comedies.  All of that was about to change, because The Toxic Avenger took everything to the extreme, and would become the standard for every ensuing Troma release.  There are no famous faces here, and the only place you would have seen a lot of the cast were in other Troma productions.  You won t find any A-listers in The Toxic Avenger (unless you count a blink and you ll miss it cameo from a young Marisa Tomei as an extra).  What you will find are all the ingredients that Troma has mastered since their inception.  Violence.  Sex.  Comedy.  Gore.  Every aspect was pushed to the nth degree here, and those pieces put together created an outlandishly entertaining superhero origin story.  Melvin Ferd (Mark Torgl) is a skinny little nerd working as the mop boy at the Tromaville Health Club, a place that seems to have every stereotype you could think of locked into a membership.  Melvin s days are spent mopping up after all the meatheads and miscreants that inhabit the health club, and his mere existence seems to agitate Bozo (Gary Schneider) and his crew.  In fact, Bozo is such a stressed out soul that he spends his nights looking for relief in the form of running down innocent children.  Rather than turn him in, his friend Slug (Robert Prichard), Slug s girlfriend Wanda (Jennifer Babtist), and Bozo s own girlfriend Julie (Cindy Manion) all seem to enjoy the sick game as well, right down to taking Polaroid pictures of the kid Bozo crushed with his car.  I mean, good for Bozo for pressing on and feeling better, but methinks there are more constructive ways to deal with your anxiety than a game dependent on vehicular homicide.  Hit and run isn t as fun as torturing Melvin The Mop Boy though, and Bozo and his gang devise a plan to humiliate Melvin as payback for all of Melvin s mess-ups.  Since Melvin has eyes for Julie, she seduces him and talks him into wearing a tutu.  As if that s not embarrassing enough, she also tricks him into kissing a sheep.  Once the lights come on, Melvin sees that everyone in the health club is in on the gag, so he attempts to flee the scene.  The crowd gives chase, and their pursuit sends Melvin crashing through a window and down into an open vat of toxic waste!  The members of the health club watch on with little concern as Melvin convulses on the sidewalk, and Bozo adds insult to injury for saying that he stinks if he can t take a joke.  Panicked, Melvin runs off as he bursts into flames, and makes it home in time for the final portion of the mutation.  As he skin pulses and oozes, Melvin transforms into a hideously deformed creature of superhuman size and strength (though his mother just thinks he s finally reached puberty).  If the members of the Tromaville Health Club weren t unappealing enough, there s a crimewave running through town that would make any normal citizen second guess a move to Tromaville.  Cops can t do anything about it, Mayor Belgoody won t do anything about it (since he s secretly the man behind it all), so who is left to keep civilians safe?  We get that answer in short order, as the now monstrous Melvin dispatches of a pack of scumbags who were about to off Officer O Clancy in fairly gruesome fashion.  The same thing happens when another crew of criminals invade the local taco shop.  Melvin, now known as the  Monster Hero  due to his affinity for eliminating evildoers, squares off with them all.  After ripping them apart (literally) and using various pieces of kitchen equipment to kill them, Melvin rescues the beautiful and blind Sara (Andree Maranda).  Not only is she the first friend Melvin has ever really had, but their bond becomes love, and the two make themselves at home in the Tromaville dump.  While Melvin s new life as the Monster Hero seems to be going well, things are not so good for the Mayor and his cronies.  Belgoody does everything he can to destroy the criminal killing creature, but all of his efforts are met with more bodies being piled up.  Tearing off limbs in the taco shop and decapitating a drug dealer with a weight machine (a scene not scene in full until the original Director s Cut release of The Toxic Avenger) are just a few of the gory ways Toxie takes out the street trash. He even makes sure to dispatch some toxic justice to those who made him what he is, targeting Bozo, Slug, Wanda, and Julie.  While the women get off rather easy (Julie loses her hair as if she lost a match in Arena Mexico, and in Wanda s case literally, since she was enjoying herself in the sauna a little too much before Melvin sat her on some hot rocks), Bozo and Slug get stuck in a stolen car that is sent careening off of a cliff.  Where s Alanis Morissette to sing  Ironic  when you need her?Amidst all this mayhem, there s a very Beauty and the Beast-esque love story between Toxie and Sara (it should also be noted that a real life love story developed between Robert Prichard (Slug) and Jennifer Babtist (Wanda) while on set, and the two eventually married).  Of course, it probably helps that she can t actually see him (and her blindness is the basis of many a sight gag throughout The Toxic Avenger s runtime). When our hero pours his heart out to her and reveals that he s the Monster Hero who has been violently reducing Tromaville s criminal population, rather than run in fear she stands by her man.  Toxie s seeds of doubt are pushed even deeper into his mind when he steampresses a little old lady to death (literally steampresses a literally little old lady say it three times fast), one that Mayor Belgoody feigns is an innocent bystander to the bloodshed.  In reality she was actually the leader of a white slave trade ring, but all Belgoody needs is to spin the story to make the Monster Hero look like a remorseless killer, earning him extra support in his quest to kill the monster.  Toxie and Sara move out of their dump and into a tent towards the Tromaville city limits, where he hopes he can better control himself.  It s not long before they re found, and Belgoody, his cronies, and even the National Guard all descend on their hideaway for a climax that many might not have the stomach for Mayor Belgoody included.   For something that s not everyone s cup of tea, The Toxic Avenger is a movie that made huge waves in the 35 years since it s been released.  It spawned three sequels, a Marvel Comics series, a Toxic Crusaders cartoon series for kids (capitalizing on the Ninja Turtles craze), a toy line, t-shirts, and loads more merchandise established what was intended to be a superhero parody as a pop culture phenomenon!  The Toxic Avenger is as synonymous with Troma as Mickey Mouse is to Disney, and every single effort from this movie on featured the same formula of splatter, sex, and silliness that won audiences over.  I ll say right here and now that as someone who has seen a ton of Troma in his lifetime, it doesn t get any better than this.  I consider myself a big fan of some of their other efforts (Class of Nuke  Em High and Surf Nazis Must Die especially), but nothing comes close to the original Toxic Avenger.  It helped established Troma s identity in the film industry, so much so that Toxie became the official mascot of the studio, an honor that remains to this day.  It also gave audiences something very different from what they were used to regarding both the action and horror genres.  The Toxic Avenger is a movie that pulls no punches, and that is a theme that would only increase with every ensuing Troma release.  In fact, this first film in the Toxic Avenger series is one of the tamer Troma releases!  If this one sounds like it might be too much for you, then stay far away from films like Tromeo & Juliet and Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger Part IV.  Those are considered two modern Tromasterpieces, but at that point Troma knew what people wanted (expected?) and delivered it in spades.  (Oh, and stay far, FAR away from Troma s Redneck Zombies, which ranks among the worst movies I ve ever seen.  I sat through Blackbelt II again for the sake of this column, but don t expect Redneck Zombies to get a writeup anytime soon.  As far as that  film  goes, No Surrender Cinema is waving the white flag!)The Toxic Avenger is currently streaming free for Amazon Prime members, and can often be found on free streaming apps like Tubi and Popcornflix.  It s also available on all forms of physical media separately or in collections like  The Tox Box , which is where my DVD copy comes from.  I was a huge fan of The Toxic Avenger ever since I was a kid (I still have issues of his Marvel comic book, as well as the original Toxic Crusaders Toxie toy), and have loved this movie ever since I first recorded off television years ago.  This was the one that started it all for Troma and Toxie, and truly is a B-movie masterpiece.  Sit back, relax, and enjoy it in all of its gory, green slimed glory  just don t do it while you re at the dinner table.",NSM_Doc5_TheToxicAvenger,NSM,Action,Positive,The Toxic Avenger
25,NSM_Doc6_TheToxicAvenger,"What an awful movie. Granted, The Toxic Avenger is a Troma Studios movie, so it was a given that it was going to be bad. But this was bad on so many levels. The entire first half of the movie was bad in a bad way. It wasn't until the movie was about half over already that there was any reason to give this movie more than one turkey. And even though the second half turned things around and offered a lot more bad-movie laughs (and that's not really much of a feat, since the first half provided exactly zero) it still wasn't enough to earn the movie as a whole anything more than two turkeys.  The movie starts off with a disclaimer. ""Warning. The Toxic Avenger Contains Scenes of Extreme Violence."" Well, sure it does. And if those scenes were in the least bit realistic, the movie might have earned that disclaimer. As it is, I've seen more realistic death scenes in the Friday the 13th series.  The opening narration tells us that the town of Tromaville is the toxic waste capital of the world, a fact backed up moments later by a sign that reads ""Welcome to Tromaville: Toxic Chemical Capital of the World."" Great PR there.  We're introduced to our cast of characters early, at the Tromaville Health Club, where it would seem the entire town spends most of its time. There is Melvin, the extremely geeky janitor who becomes our eventual hero. There's Bozo, who is very ""stressed."" Slug, Bozo's sidekick, who does very little but smoke and do some terrible acting. Then there are their two girlfriends, who do even less. They're in this movie strictly to flash their assets and get killed.  Bozo and his gang have a very strange hobby. They drive around killing people. The women apparently are aroused by it. Bozo is very stressed, so he does it for a release, I guess. The thing is, they are so unsecretive about the whole deal, it's a wonder they last long enough to get whacked by the Toxic Avenger at the end. Bozo has decals on the side of his stupid car with depictions of all the things and people he has run over. Slug keeps all the newspaper clippings about their antics taped up in his locker at the health club. The two women take pictures of the victims after they get run down and look at and laugh about them in the middle of the crowded gym. It's baffling.  Eventually, Melvin ticks off Bozo and his gang, and they plot revenge. Bozo's girlfriend seduces poor Melvin and tricks him into coming to the health club pool dressed in a pink leotard and tutu. Melvin finds ""Julie"" in the dark by the pool, but when the lights are turned on, it is revealed that he is instead kissing a very very very fake looking sheep dressed in a bikini. No, I'm not kidding. Anyway, the crowded health club has a laugh at Melvin's expense as Melvin runs around like a spaz.  Meanwhile, outside, two poor truck drivers who have been driving for ""two whole hours"" pull over right in front of the health club. They start snorting some dope (which they do by sticking their entire faces into two big plastic bags with so much dope in them these guys must be millionaires to be able to afford them) as they take their well-earned break. Their cargo is, of course, toxic waste. You can tell that because they're carrying it in open drums on the back of a flatbed truck. The stuff is bright green and bubbly, which is exacly how we're all pretty sure toxic waste looks. These drums aren't even strapped on to the stupid truck, they're just sitting there lined up in rows. Even if the name of the movie weren't The Toxic Avenger, I'd already be pretty sure someone was going to fall into one of those drums.  Sure enough, Melvin doesn't disappoint us. He runs away from the taunting crowd of people to the upstairs of the health club. Unfortunately, all of the taunters follow him, so he does the only logical thing he can do at this point and dives through a closed second floor window into the vats of toxic waste waiting below.  ""He's a faker!"" Bozo declares as pretty much the entire town gathers around Melvin as he writhes on the ground in extreme agony. People come running from every direction to laugh at Melvin as his skin bubbles and boils. Eventually, he actually catches on fire and goes running down the street as the town watches on, still laughing.  At this point, Melvin goes to the hospital to get emergency treatment for his terrible condition and -- oh no wait, that's not what happens. That's what would happen if this were anything but a Troma Studios movie. Instead, Melvin goes home and takes a bath. His concerned mother knocks on the door repeatedly and asks if he's ok. Melvin just whimpers as his skin and hair fall off. Eventually, he grows muscles, and his voice deepens as he lets out a loud roar. ""My little Melvin! He must have finally reached puberty!"" his proud mother says from outside the bathroom.  We then switch to a scene where three very odd thugs attempt to bribe a cop. The cop refuses, and the thugs begin to beat him up. Enter The Toxic Avenger, hero of the people, protector of innocents, crotch-grabber extrodinaire. I'm not kidding. In this scene he grabs the crotch of each bad guy at least once and repeatedly beats on the family jewels of poor ""Cigar Face."" Unfortunately, this would set the tone for the whole movie, as crotch shots play a big role in the life of The Toxic Avenger. He's on the giving and receiving end of some prett vicious nad whacks throughout the course of the movie. After saving the cop, Melvin tries to go home, but his mother screams and slams the door in his face when she sees him, which leaves the poor outcast no other recourse than to go sleep in the dump.  At some indeterminite point in the future, three even stranger thugs try to rob a Mexican restaurant. They put on a comedy routine for the people and make no actual attempt to steal anything. The leader sets his sights on a pretty blind woman (gee, can't see where this is going already) and tries to have his way with her. However, the woman's guide dog will have none of that and growls and barks at the thug. In a stunning scene that flies in the face of movie convention (which states that you can kill, maim, mutilate, massacre, and destroy as many humans as you want, but you can't ever harm a single cute furry animal) the thug has his buddy blow away the dog so he can continue his assault on the girl.  Fortunately for everyone except the poor dog, The Toxic Avenger shows up to save the day. A long, genital-smashing laden fight scene ensues, which ends with Toxic making a sundae on one of the thugs head before drilling a hole in his face, forcing another thugs hands into the deep fryer while the thug screams, ""We were only kidding! What's the matter, you can't take a joke?"" and throwing the third thug into an oven.  As he is leaving, Toxic is stopped by the blind woman, who can't find her way home without her dog. (Watch closely and you can see the boom mike bob into the scene as Toxic and blind woman talk. Actually, you don't have to watch all that closely -- it's pretty freaking obvious. I caught it, and I was only half watching the stupid movie at this point.) So Toxic does the chivalrous thing and leads her home, where she immediately whacks him in the testicular area with her cane.  The authorities bring in Dr. Snotburger for a press conference, who tells the public in a very animated fashion that ""the monster"" has a sense for evil and will destroy only evil people. He knows this because of the traces of the monster he has apparently analyzed and by the impeccible deductive skills that have shown him that the monster only has killed evil people up to this point. This is the first and last time we see Dr. Snotburger, which leads me to believe he was only in this movie as an excuse to use the name ""Dr. Snotburger.""  Toxic kills more bad guys and saves innocent people for a while. Eventually he and Sarah become an item. (Gee, the hot blind chick falls for the disfigured guy -- why didn't I see that coming? Oh wait, I did.) This leads to the first actual funny scene in the movie, a montage of domestic images as Sarah and Toxic set up house together (in the dump of course), which of course includes shots of Toxic getting whacked in the peepee.  Eventually, Toxic goes and kills Bozo and Slug's girlfriends, then Bozo and Slug themselves. Toxic rides on the roof of the car Bozo and Slug just stole from a little old lady, while Bozo tries to shake him off. Toxic throws Slug out of the car and gets in next to Bozo. He tromps down on the gas, and he and Bozo go rocketing off down the street. In this scene, I think Toxic hurts and kills more innocent people while trying to kill Bozo than he does bad people in the movie. Go figure. Anyway, the car eventually flies off a cliff and bursts into flames. We time slip a bit, and the fire is now completely out -- and here is Toxic, none the worse for having just sat in the middle of a towering inferno, climbing out of the car.  He goes to the dry cleaner and kills a little old lady, then home to the dump to be with Sarah. ""Every day I go out and MASH people!"" he complains, and his loving girlfriend suggests they escape to the country and go camping so he can avoid the temptation to MASH people.  Meanwhile, the mayor uses the killing of the old lady as an excuse to turn the town against the monster. Never mind that the old lady turned out to be head of a white slavery ring. The evil mayor gets the governor to order out the National Guard, and they surround the tent in the woods that Toxic and Sarah are staying in. This one scene was the only scene I really really enjoyed in the movie. It starts with a shot of the tent, from which come the sounds of very theatrical snoring (you know, the snore-whistle thing that only cartoon characters actually do), and pulls back to show the National Guard surrounding the tent with tanks and machine guns pointed directly at it. Priceless.  The mayor orders Toxic shot, but when he emerges from the tent, everyone has a change of heart and won't kill him. The mayor pulls out his pistol and starts shooting, but the bullets bounce right off Toxic's manly chest. Toxic kills the mayor, and everyone rejoices. Suddenly, Sarah starts yelling for Melvin. ""Melvin!"" she screams. ""Sarah!"" Toxic replies, wading through the crowd of rejoicing citizens to get to his beloved. They shout back and forth several times until they finally reach each other and embrace, which causes the assembled crowd to go absolutely nuts with their screaming and shouting. It's all very inexplicable. Thankfully, it's also the end.  Scene to watch for: Melvin reading the warning sign by the pool.  Best line: ""He is screwing up my Karma. AHHHHHH!!!""  Things that make you go ""Huh?"": Doing situps with a cigarette. ",NSM_Doc6_TheToxicAvenger,NSM,Action,Negative,The Toxic Avenger
26,NSM_Doc7_TheToxicAvenger,"In 1990, I got into  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  and eventually learned that the source material was adult-aimed comic books. The same year, the  Toxic Crusaders  cartoon was on TV and the Playmates action figures were right next to  TMNT  toys on the shelves. The source material here makes  TMNT s  look tame by comparison, and I can only hope not too many kids checked out the 1984  Toxic Avenger  movie and became traumatized.  Troma or trauma?  The Toxic Avenger,  lauded by many as a classic entry from Troma Entertainment (which decades later became known as the proving grounds of James Gunn), is part soft-core porn, part Fangoria-baiting gore-porn, and part Z-movie production values with continuity and lighting errors.  It s not good by any means, but it s easier to watch than bad movies that are trying to be good movies. I am embarrassed to admit I had a smile on my face by the end.  The concept from writers Lloyd Kaufman (who co-directs with Michael Herz) and Joe Ritter is that we ll see criminals in Tromaville, N.J., do horrible things and then enjoy vigilante Toxie (Mitch Cohen physically, Kenneth Kessler vocally and Mark Torgl pre-transformation) doing horrible things to the criminals in retaliation.  Objectively speaking, it s truly stunning what happens in this merely R-rated film. The primary villains   based out of Tromaville Fitness, which looks like Ground Zero for the coronavirus   make a game out of using their car as a weapon to murder pedestrians and cyclists.  They get bonus points for killing kids and racial minorities.  The Toxic Avenger  includes a scene where these people run over a kid on a bike, then when he turns out to be still alive, they go back and make sure to run over his head, squishing it.  One big goof While this is totally inappropriate for young and sensitive viewers, it s possible to have such a thing on a film that people will rent on a lark at the video store because everyone knows it s one big goof. The actors purposely overact and the gore, albeit gross, is purposely unrealistic.  While it s interesting for a half-second to think about a town (or perhaps the gym specifically?) that turns out men and women so lacking in empathy that violent murder is pure entertainment to them, it s obvious a half-second later that  The Toxic Avenger  is not making a point of any kind.  It s stupid for the sake of comedy. Perhaps the closest modern equivalent would be something like the  Super Troopers  movies, but even that doesn t line up. Simply put, they don t make movies like this anymore, and they never will again.  The Toxic Avenger  gets its humor (or  humor,  if you re not in the spirit) out of not only killing kids, but also killing dogs and poking fun at gay people, blind people, and forced child prostitution.  Patched-together performance The patched together Toxie performance is barely more interesting than that of Swamp Thing in his two unwatchable 1980s films. Despite performing in garish porn-style scenes,  Toxic Avenger s  women are quite good looking.  Andree Maranda s Sara is particularly endearing as Toxie s blind girlfriend. The film holds back on its pornographic urges in order to secure an R rating here, which is arguably too bad because it misses out on humorous ways to explain why Sara likes this creature, whose only deformity is his face. The rest of him is just dirty, basically.  The stiffly staged fight scenes follow the format of cutting to shocked reactions of innocent bystanders as Toxie offs criminals in bizarre ways in back alleys and restaurants. Adding some spice is the total corruption of the local government, led by a fat mayor (Pat Ryan Jr.). When Toxie rips out the mayor s intestines in the grand finale, the gore effect is disappointing.   The Toxic Avenger    which led to three film sequels along with the aforementioned kiddie cartoon   relies on the audience s forgiveness for the fact that it s cheaply made. If it had more money, it could ve beefed up some key special effects shots and been better. As it stands, it s the most brazenly dumb movie so far in my Superhero Saturday series, but honestly not the worst.",NSM_Doc7_TheToxicAvenger,NSM,Action,Negative,The Toxic Avenger
27,NSM_Doc8_TheToxicAvenger,"Back in 1982, Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz released a short independent film to a single New York movie house. Lloyd likes to think that this was the spark that started it all, but everyone I've ever met who saw the movie, saw it first on video in 1987.  Home Video has saved many an arthouse flop, and even though THE TOXIC AVENGER is by far no arthouse movie (per se that is, after all, Arthouse theaters created the sensation of THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW), Toxic Avenger has a wacked out appeal that gets under your skin. I've introduced many a person to THE TOXIC AVENGER that just watched the movie with disgusted disbelief, only to find themselves, days later, snickering over some mind numbingly ridiculous scene.  The story is about Melvin Junko (Mark Torgl: CITIZEN TOXIE: The Toxic Avenger Part IV) the janitor; a nerdish, cowardly outcast who is the punching bag for every person at the local gym.  One day the cruelty goes too far and Melvin falls into a vat of toxic waste, much to everyone's delight. The waste later transforms him into The Monster Hero! (which is Toxie only they didn't have the title for the movie when they shot it) i.e. THE TOXIC AVENGER (please tell me that you saw it coming). Toxie goes on a rampage to ""clean-up"" the town of Tromaville in the most brutal ways possible, though no one gets what they DON'T deserve.  Screenwriter Lloyd credits ""Toxie's"" charms to the fact that he's an outcast, an oddball and a rebel, but I think Toxie's true charm lies in the fact that the movie, instead of spoofing major budget pictures, goes for the throat of its own: Cheap, crappy movies!  The fun of THE TOXIC AVENGER is that it is funny on purpose. The characters, even and especially the bad guys, are all over the top and unbelievable. I'm talking Way WAY over the top! It skewers everything including itself, without ever stooping to lampooning any one specific movie.  Unlike reference comedies like Airplane, Spyhard, or Hotshots where many of the jokes go flying over your head if you haven't seen the specific flick being shined, THE TOXIC AVENGER is recognizable to all. THE TOXIC AVENGER is every monster movie we've ever seen on every Saturday episode of those local ""Horror House"" TV shows.  This is not to say that Toxie is just as mild. The violence is brutally graphic, from squishing eyeballs in their sockets to crushing a child's head under a car tire. Yet the gore is done with such unabashed fun that it reminds me of an old MAD magazine comic come to life. In later years, THE TOXIC AVENGER became a Saturday morning cartoon and even had its own line of action figures.  TROMA Team Video is becoming quite popular these days among the Metal crowd and their new releases star the likes of musicians such as Lemmy Kilmiester. Lloyd Kaufman is one of my favorite people in the world and I'm glad that there are folks like him and Director Michael Herz out there putting out such horrible, outrageous fun.  THE TOXIC AVENGER is one of the worst I've ever seen and well deserves its Five Negative Shriek Girls for being so bad it's great!",NSM_Doc8_TheToxicAvenger,NSM,Action,Negative,The Toxic Avenger
28,NSM_Doc9_TheToxicAvenger,"Yes, of course, that is true, but taking on a full month of Tro-madness   and we saw the good, the bad and the ugly there!   did make me think that maybe I ve not really given enough coverage to one of the leading purveyors of cult and often B-movie horror. So I m going to make a point to stop by Tromaville a little more often as we go forward, without necessarily making it any kind of regular feature. I m sure there are many fans out there, and maybe some curious to find out more, so I hope you ll enjoy my occasional dips into this particular pool.  And what better place to possibly begin than with one of the studio s most popular movies, The Toxic Avenger? I think I saw this in the dim and distant past, but honestly I have very little recollection of it. However, what it did also jolt loose was a memory of the Toxic Crusaders cartoon that I watched as a youngster. Little did I know back then exactly what the source material was, of course, but what a choice as the inspiration for a piece of Saturday morning kids  entertainment. I m waiting for the Freddie Kreuger or Michael Myers cartoon in years to come   Anyway, back to the matter in hand, The Toxic Avenger follows the story of geek Melvin, who works cleaning the local swimming pool and finds himself square in the crosshairs of the local bullies and jocks. But when a prank backfires, Melvin is covered in toxic waste   and lo, The Toxic Avenger is born! Determined to put the wrongs of Tromaville right, Melvin now spends his time catching criminals and taking on the corrupt upper echelons of the town. He also finds himself in the middle of a love story with Sara, a blind woman that he saves from a robbery. But the mayor and the local army don t want this  monster  around, despite his many good deeds, which leads to an epic final confrontation.  What can I say about this one? It s Troma, so you sort of know what to expect, and this one has many of the hallmarks of the studio   it s silly, it s overblown, there s a lot of sex and nudity and the characters lean into the stereotypes of the time. I want to say this one is harmless fun, but I don t think this one has aged terribly well, and some of the language and terminology in here did make me wince. The costume for Toxie himself is pretty laughable, even for early 80s Troma, and while there are a few funny moments some of it just winds up feeling a bit too try-hard to really land as the directors might have pictured.  This one was obviously a success in its own way, spawning no less than three sequels, not to mention the cartoon and even a couple of video games (do I need to do a Game Gutter or something?) but for me it doesn t rank as my favourite Troma offering. It might be the one that launched the studio into the big time in relative terms   it certainly got a much larger following than any of their late 70s and early 80s titles   but there s not much here that will live long in the memory for me personally. Suppose that explains why I forgot most of it from the first watch   To be honest, if you loved lots of other Troma films, it s going to be good you ll get something out of this one. But this one never quite clicked with me, and on the rewatch it feels like time has rather moved on past poor old Toxie and the rest of the crew here. Some horror movies (and even horror comedies) can age like a fine wine, but this one feels as though it s turned a little toxic instead. There s better Troma out there for me, even though the company might not exist in the form we know it without this one s success, so I suppose that has to count something towards this one!",NSM_Doc9_TheToxicAvenger,NSM,Action,Negative,The Toxic Avenger
29,NSM_Doc10_TheToxicAvenger,"Troma Entertainment was founded by Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz in 1974 and has been known henceforth as the foremost purveyor of Z-movies   films of such low budget, standard, and taste that they don t qualify even as B-films. And millions of horror fans have loved them for it. They have become the category standard by which all intentionally terrible movies are judged, which is a testament to their value as valid entertainment. As an eighties kid Troma movies were a rite of passage. Their overt nudity, violence, and surrealist mania was known among the playgrounds from kids whose older siblings had let them watch a beat up rental cassette. If you hadn t seen a Troma film, you probably lied and said you had.  No Troma film was more well-known to us elementary schoolers than The Toxic Avenger (1984), an R-rated offering that oddly became even more popular with kids after it was made into an environmentalist children s cartoon in the early 1990s called Toxic Crusaders. I can even remember the jingle that accompanied the toy line:  Toxic Crusaders   they re gross, but they still get girls.  I think I still have some action figures somewhere. It s similar to the unlikelihood of Rambo   a Vietnam vet who experiences violent flashbacks and who burned down a small American town   also becoming a cartoon hero in 1986. The Toxic Avenger represents the surprisingly uncommon coupling of the comic book superhero and horror. With an overflowing abundance of low-brow humor, gore and exploitation to fill it out, Toxie has since become Troma s flagship icon.  As a kid I loved Troma films. They were beyond anything I had ever seen while still keeping to well-worn 1950s horror tropes; they were a combination of the bizarre and the comfortably familiar. They were intentionally bad movies that tried to cross into the so-bad-it s-good realm, offering unapologetically crass entertainment. Troma movies are ones to watch when you re in the right mood, and preferably with the right companions. The Toxic Avenger is certainly one of their films that still manages to hold viewers  attention and even generates intentional laughs from its endearing, irresistible awfulness.  For those who don t know, the movie tells of a skinny nerd who works as a janitor at a gym who gets harassed and pranked and ends up falling into a barrel of toxic waste   while wearing a pink tutu, of course. The radioactive chemicals result in deformities, super strength, and an unstoppable impulse to vanquish evil in all its forms. If that sounds like a plot you d be interested in seeing on screen, even out of purely morbid curiosity, Toxie might be worth checking out for you. However, the movie is filled with cartoonish characters, terrible acting, worse dialogue, blatant stereotypes, gory but unconvincing special effects, and of course boobs. We even get hilarious dubbing. If that generates further interest, then Toxie is definitely worth checking out.  Troma movies aren t for everyone. Most of the time, they aren t even for me. But I ve seen The Toxic Avenger many times over the years and I m sure one day I ll share it with my son so he can tell all the kids on the playground about the crazy-ass Troma film he just saw.",NSM_Doc10_TheToxicAvenger,NSM,Action,Negative,The Toxic Avenger
0,EMK_Doc1_TheRevenant,"There s nothing more exhausting than a filmmaker who thinks they have to dress up a genre picture with a lot of arty nonsense, and that s the best way to sum up The Revenant, the new film from freshly minted Oscar winner Alejandro Gonz lez I  rritu (Birdman). It runs a lumpy 156 minutes, and there s a decent, 105-minute wilderness survival/neo-Western revenge tale in there, if you want to dig it out. But you ll have to burrow past all the macho posturing, blood-coughing misery, and faux-Malick twinkliness to find it. It comes into theaters atop a wave of breathless reporting of its difficult shoot, a hell of delays and dysfunction, the kind of thing that used to be considered bad press (back in the Heaven s Gate days) yet somehow seems like branding now. Making The Revenant was an ordeal, you see, in which people froze and suffered and came to blows, and they d like to pass the ordeal on to you, the viewer. To be certain, its approach   the old boys  adventure tale, told with an adult edge and style   could work, and early on, it does. The opening attack on a group of hunter/trappers by a band of Native Americans plays like a series of blunt body blows, one gruesome kill stacked atop the next, the sudden, scary brutality of their arrow hits resulting in an onscreen bloodbath. Their numbers thin considerably, and things get bleaker when their scout, Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), is badly mauled and nearly killed by a bear. And, somehow, things get worse from there. Much has been made of the physical trials DiCaprio put himself through at the service of this, his latest bid for that elusive Academy Award, and I ll fess up: my outlook on The Revenant start to curdle once he lands, half-dying, on his makeshift stretcher, since there may be no image that summarizes the pandering of  award season  more succinctly than lock-jawed Leo, face torn to shreds, grunting and slobbering and snotting all over himself. Yet that s not what sinks the movie; it s I  rritu s insistence on making that image the overriding aesthetic. It s a grim bit of business, this movie, a misery wallow whose undeniably sharp execution only underlines the filmmaker s interest in creating not an adventure, or even a cogent narrative, but an endurance test. The picture is beautifully lensed by the brilliant Emmanuel Lubezki, I  rritu s cinematographer on Birdman, and they again tinker with long, unbroken takes (though not, y know, as long), staging scenes and relationships within a wider, moving frame, rather than constructing them in the editing room. But Lubezki s work is less reminiscent of Birdman than his Terrence Malick collaborations The New World and The Tree of Life, full of gorgeous waking dream imagery and haunting shots of raging fires in a nighttime snowstorm or a bell ringing atop a decimated church. Yet those frames are curiously deadening   exquisite enough to put in a frame and hang on a wall, but at odds with the forward momentum a story like this requires. The Revenant is a film that works best in motion, as our protagonist struggles down a river, dodging gunshots and precarious waterfalls, or rides a horse right off a cliff. But when I  rritu stops to gaze at his navel, the movie crashes to a halt at his feet. These and other holy-cow moments are enough to hang your hat on, cinematically speaking, but when self-consciously intellectual filmmakers lower themselves to making a genre movie, they think they have to gussy it up. It feels like I  rritu is using his artiness as justification for his thrills, rather than just earning them honestly. Does The Revenant pull the viewer in? Yes. Is it well made? Undeniably. Is Tom Hardy once again scarily convincing and pretty much capable of anything? Of course. But this is a movie that sweats and bellows and stomps so loud, for so long, that it s ultimately an exhausting exercise in what happens when an Oscar winner decides he s going to do some demystifying. Imagine what a John Sturges or a Howard Hawks could ve done with this material. Better yet, don t.",EMK_Doc1_TheRevenant,EMK,Action,Negative,The Revenant
1,EMK_Doc2_TheRevenant,"The story of Hugh Glass, the tough-as-buckskin American frontiersman who in 1823 dragged his brutalised body over miles of rough terrain after being mauled by a grizzly and left for dead, was the stuff of legend almost as soon as it began to be passed around the young republic. In spite of this fact, save for a loose retelling by Vanishing Point director Richard C. Sarafian with Richard Harris, 1971 s Man in the Wilderness, Glass s story has never been immortalised on screen in the fashion of, say, the defence of the Alamo, the shooting of Jesse James or the gunfight at the OK Corral. There is one rather simple reason for this: there ain t a hell of a lot of story there. This is no obstacle for Alejandro G. I  rritu, who has shot a version of Glass s tale adapted from a 2002 novel by Michael Punke, an expert in international trade law and policy. The Revenant begins with a scene from a very different period in US trade history: fur trappers load the fruits of their summer s labour on to a flatboat, preparing to shove off down the Missouri River, when suddenly a hail of arrows explodes from the forest, followed by a Pawnee war party. I  rritu, collaborating with the nonpareil cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki for the second time after last year s Birdman, opens fire in tandem, rolling out the film s first breathless set piece: a violent skirmish staged as an unbroken tracking shot in which the camera latches on to and is passed between combatants on both sides, incidentally picking up bloody vignettes that include a trapper being garrotted with a bowstring and a shirtless drunk putting a bullet through the head of a tethered horse. Every report of musketry sounds off like a howitzer, and when a fleeing mountaineer is tackled and dragged down into the river by a brave, the camera will naturally follow underwater in due course. The approach to the material taken by I  rritu and Lubezki   and in the case of The Revenant it seems very fitting to consider the two co-authors   is immersive and visceral. Wide-open spaces and stifling subjectivity combine in filmmaking that variously evokes Elem Klimov, Mikhail Kalatozov, or the mode of Philippe Grandrieux on a multiplex budget, offering an urgent life-or-death engagement with surroundings which substitues for the relative paucity of narrative incident or character development. What story there is embellishes the known facts of the Glass case: mortally wounded by a mama grizzly bear, he is abandoned by the men assigned to minister to him in his final hours. One of these men, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy, typically hammy, here sucking on a mouthful of settler beard), dispatches Glass s half-Native American son before taking his leave, providing Glass with a spur of revenge to keep him moving beyond the limits of exhaustion. Starring as Glass, Leonardo DiCaprio is on screen for most of the film s running time, which is listed at 156 minutes but which I am fairly sure is closer to 17 hours. DiCaprio is one of our most viable classical-sense-of-the-word movie stars, though the particular nature of his gifts is better evidenced by his work in the 2013 one-two punch of The Great Gatsby and The Wolf of Wall Street than by anything in The Revenant, which indulges the actor s puerile equivalency of suffering with serious acting. (I recalled while watching that he petitioned James Cameron to play the hero of Titanic with a club foot.) Faces furrowed in pain tend to look similar, and nothing in the film exploits DiCaprio s individual skill set as a performer, leaving him to work through he-man hang-ups and literally chew on the scenery (twigs and berries, that is). While I  rritu and Lubezki wow in scenes that anyone working with similar money and in similar circumstances could hardly fail to make impressive, the handling of Glass s family history is a haze of jerky-tough platitudes and cribbed Malick-isms, arbitrarily flitted through in order to give Glass a motive for vengeance and to establish that, through his relations with the Native Americans, he is somewhat less unprincipled trash than the other Europeans in the wilderness. The plot might belong to an Anthony Mann-James Stewart western, but rather than the creeping queasiness that follows in a Mann film when a thirst for revenge is slaked, The Revenant closes on a heaving, sweaty flop, a physical collapse at the end of an endurance test. As Tarantino has done in his own very different snowbound Christmas western The Hateful Eight, I  rritu offers up a manifesto that presents a distinct vision of pure cinema and the potentialities of the medium. It is overwhelming but unmoving, a rush of brute force that leaves the nagging afterthought,  Is that all there is? ",EMK_Doc2_TheRevenant,EMK,Action,Negative,The Revenant
2,EMK_Doc3_TheRevenant,"The Revenant is a survival-against-the-odds film that so puts Leonardo DiCaprio through it I bet he was thinking,  I wish I was back on that boat that went down.  He is mauled by a bear. Viciously. He is buried alive. He eats still-throbbing, blood-dripping raw liver, and quite forgets his manners. (Wipe your chin, man; there s never any excuse.) He cauterises his own wounds, falls off cliffs, spins down rapids, slits open a dead horse and sleeps within for warmth. The film recently triumphed at the Golden Globes   best film, best director (Alejandro G. I  rritu), best actor (DiCaprio)   but all I was thinking was,  Oh God, please let this be over soon.  Faint hope. It s two-and-a-half hours long, long, long and while there are moments of tremendous, jaw-dropping beauty, the violence is so pitiless and the spiritual aspects so pitiful that even I wished he was back on that boat that went down. I know. Imagine. This is based, apparently, on the true story of Hugo Glass, a 19th-century fur trapper who became famous in 1823 for surviving that bear attack, being abandoned by the two members of his expedition tasked to stay with him and staggering 200 miles over six weeks to avenge those who had left him for dead. Set in Montana and South Dakota, but filmed in the Canadian Rockies and Argentina, this opens as it means to go on, with grandeur and magnificence   a breathtaking landscape, an icy sun filtering through the groaning pines   combined with unflinching brutality. A hunting party is under attack from a Native American tribe, and the first you know about it is when, thwock!, an arrow bisects one of their throats. And from what I then saw from between my fingers, there were scalpings. (I think.) Only a few escape, as led by Captain Henry (Domhnall Gleeson), but their progress is substantially stalled when Glass, who is travelling with his teenage son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), is set upon by that grizzly. This is an astounding scene. The bear is one big mamma. The bear is enormous. The bear ripples and claws. The bear bites and paws. The bear is CGI, presumably, but you can feel its breath on your own face, having forced its way through the gaps between your fingers, and the sequence is filmed in a single, seemingly never-ending take, as if happening in real time. Afterwards, Glass is practically dead. He cannot move. He cannot speak. His wounds gape and pulse. Henry thinks he should kill him, but can t. Offering money, he commands a fellow hunter, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy, employing a weird accent), to stay with him, along with one other (Will Poulter) so the two can give him a decent burial when he dies. Hawk stays too. Hawk is half-Native American, on his mother s side. Hawk is Glass s back story, as told in flashbacks. Hawk is fictional, invented by I  rritu to, presumably, offer up a father-son narrative, thereby adding another emotional layer to the story, but this always feels like exactly what it is: a contrivance, added on for effect. This is not a film you go to see for its emotional complexity is what I m saying. (I think.) The action progresses when it transpires that Fitzgerald is not a man of his word, proves murderous, and Glass ends up tossed into an open grave. The rest of the film is then devoted to Glass not dying, as he scrabbles for food and water, falls off those cliffs, spins down those icy rapids, performs self-surgery on his infected, festering wounds   oh, Jesus!   and so on. DiCaprio s performance is one of grunts and lunges and groans and doing a particular grimace that put me in mind of Jack Nicholson on the poster for The Shining. He doesn t have much to do beyond this, but he does do it all with conviction. The film is about its visual aesthetic and splendour   even every little scrap of moss looks truly alive   and the fact that it s not afraid to heap primal horror on to primal horror, even though I rather wish it were. But I  rritu (who also gave us the rather gimmicky Birdman) is all swagger and not much else. Story-wise, you have to suspend disbelief and keep it suspended or you ve had it, basically. Glass, for example, seems to go from disabled to able-bodied with remarkable speed. There are continuity errors, to do with coats and furs and when there s snow and when there isn t. As for the flashbacks, which recount the murder of Hawk s mother by white soldiers, these scenes are sentimental clich s, as well as jam-packed with spiritual banalities. ( Revenant , by the way, means  a person who returns in spirit after death  and there is no shame in having to look that up  I hope.) Whether you enjoy   is that the right word?   this film will essentially depend on how strong your stomach is, and whether stories such as this float your boat. I admired its ambition, but also found it an endurance test. I was longing for it to be over, and so relieved when it was.",EMK_Doc3_TheRevenant,EMK,Action,Negative,The Revenant
3,EMK_Doc4_TheRevenant,"Many awful films have swept the Oscars, but few have been as flamboyantly empty as Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Birdman, or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance   a self-congratulatory ""satire"" that wasted the talents of a game-for-anything Michael Keaton, targeting superhero blockbusters and highbrow theatre without saying anything meaningful about either. Though no less bombastic, Inarritu's follow-up The Revenant is a more acceptable showcase for his stylistic gifts, a basically straightforward revenge Western with inevitable pretentious trimmings. Adapted by Inarritu and co-writer Mark L. Smith from a novel by Michael Punke, the film is loosely based on a real incident from 1823. The hero Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) belongs to a band of fur trappers, battling their way through a snowy wilderness in what is now South Dakota. When Glass is attacked by a grizzly bear   in a virtuoso special effects sequence   most of the men press on, with the malcontent Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) heading a small group left to tend to their fallen comrade. It doesn't take long for Fitzgerald's wickedness to show itself: he murders Glass' teenage son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) and leaves Glass himself to die in a shallow grave. From here, we follow Glass' quest to get back onto home turf, with suspense arising from the question of just how much punishment he can endure. We see him plunging down a waterfall, using gunpowder to cauterise his wounds and sheltering inside a dead horse   having first removed its internal organs, a process portrayed at stomach-churning length. Built on frantic long takes filmed with extreme wide-angle lenses, Inarritu's style is all about creating a feeling of immersion. There are affinities with the recent work of Terrence Malick, unsurprisingly given that Inarritu and Malick share a cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki. But the primary influence is the late Russian master Andrei Tarkovsky, with his taste for images that are ""elemental"" in the literal sense: bodies collapsing into the earth, fires blazing in the middle of snow. Inarritu's belief that a film should consist of an unbroken series of wow moments leads to a certain visual monotony   though this is offset by the more carefully modulated work of a crack team of sound designers, whose efforts are closely co-ordinated with the equally effective score (three composers are credited). Insistent percussion blends with horses' hooves or the thud of arrows; high-pitched strings evoke ringing in the ears in the aftermath of shock. As an action movie with a grisly exploitation edge, The Revenant could have been a triumph. But Inarritu can't seem to stop lunging after greatness: some of his symbolic touches reach new heights of kitsch, notably the shot of a bird emerging from the bloodied bosom of Glass' dying Native American wife (Grace Dove). Just as risible are the metaphysical ruminations after the fashion of Cormac McCarthy, such as Fitzgerald's account of his father meeting God in the guise of a squirrel, delivered by Hardy in typically slurred, near-incomprehensible tones. Like a good portion of McCarthy's writing, The Revenant seems intended as a vision of the founding violence of American history   which, if it means anything, ought to mean violence inflicted on the original inhabitants of the land. Here, however, the film is fatally timid, held back by a spurious ""even-handed"" approach. If the whites carry out massacres, Native American warriors do as well; Fitzgerald's wickedness is balanced by the decency of Captain Henry (Domhnall Gleeson), the trappers' well-spoken commander. As for Glass himself, the film rarely pauses for long enough to tell us much about him as an individual. DiCaprio deserves a medal for physical stamina, but as far as his performance is concerned, it would make little difference if Inarritu had replaced him with, say, Michael Fassbender or Christian Bale. Yet in a more abstract sense, The Revenant depends on DiCaprio's celebrity aura: like Birdman, it's a star vehicle that assumes our willingness to take the suffering of the white male protagonist more seriously than anything else.In turn, this allows the film to maintain a nominally progressive stance while trading on stereotypes of the most hackneyed sort. Where Glass heroically endures to the end, the Native American characters suggest ghosts ready to fade away   less full-fledged human beings than unknowable instruments of God.",EMK_Doc4_TheRevenant,EMK,Action,Negative,The Revenant
4,EMK_Doc5_TheRevenant,"No: Leonardo DiCaprio is not raped by a bear in  The Revenant,  although the fact that such an idiotic meme emerged, and was considered halfway conceivable by at least a few actual humans, tells you something about Alejandro G. I  rritu s operatic, ultraviolent revenge western. DiCaprio spends the entire movie escaping one near-death situation after the other, fleeing from (and/or pursuing) wild animals, natural phenomena, vengeful Native American warriors, French soldiers and a mumbling redneck villain played by Tom Hardy. Once I had got hold of the idea that this was the most elaborate Roadrunner cartoon of all time, I couldn t get rid of it. (Hardy s shipment from the Acme Dynamite Corp. must have gotten stuck in the snow somewhere.)  The Revenant  is the big, Oscar-flavored follow-up to I  rritu s Oscar-winning  Birdman,  and like that film it was shot by Emmanuel  Chivo  Lubezki, a cinematographer whose impact on 21st-century film has been almost immeasurable. (Consider the r sum :  Y Tu Mam  Tambi n,   The New World,   Children of Men,   The Tree of Life,   Gravity  and at least two more Terrence Malick films to come.) For a while, at least, this one feels like I  rritu s masterpiece, until that familiar too-muchness begins to take over. It features all the cinematic bravado and enormous narrative ambition that have made the Mexican director   well, whatever it is that he is. A flawed genius? A guy who bakes spectacular cakes but always forgets some crucial ingredient? Or maybe just a talented filmmaker who needs to get over trying to be Orson Welles, Stanley Kubrick and Boccaccio in every second of every movie. In one of those strange coincidences that starts to make you believe that there is a God and that his/her sense of humor is refreshingly straightforward,  The Revenant  is one of two ultraviolent revenge westerns being released on Christmas Day. (At 156 minutes, this one is the shorter of the two   by half an hour!) Because nothing quite goes along with honey-glazed ham and a crackling Yule log like watching someone get scalped alive or have his nuts shot off, by way of a reminder that our entire civilization was founded on ruthless carnage. While  The Revenant  and Quentin Tarantino s  The Hateful Eight  are different stories told in extremely different modes   one a swashbuckling outdoor adventure, the other a claustrophobic indoor mystery   they re both set in the Mountain West during the 19th century, outside the established borders of the United States, and both preach roughly the same dire text on American history. Mind you, the 19th century in the American West covers a whole lot of territory.  The Revenant  is set half a century before Tarantino s film, during the chaotic Western expansion of the 1820s, when hunters, trappers and the ragtag troops of the brand new United States Army began to explore the virtually unknown regions west of the Missouri River. One of the film s themes or subjects, I would say   as in any I  rritu movie, you could identify dozens of them   is the idea that our continent s history had not yet been written, and things didn t have to end up as they did. DiCaprio s character, Hugh Glass, is a white frontiersman and wilderness guide who has lived among Native Americans for years and can understand several Native languages. (The realism on that front is unusual and commendable: We hear Pawnee, Arikara and Lakota spoken in the film, reflecting the fact that numerous different groups speaking mutually incomprehensible languages came into collision with each other, as well as with the Americans and the French, during that period of intense cultural disruption.) His late wife was a Native woman who died in a village massacre that we experience in a series of overly mystical I  rritu flashbacks, and that was apparently carried out by white troops. Hugh is now guiding a band of military beaver trappers alongside his teenage son, Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), a  half-breed  viewed with near-universal distrust. In the real history of the American West there were numerous men like Hugh Glass, who sought peaceful coexistence with Native Americans, in the first instance as a matter of survival and commercial advantage, and who came to understand and embrace Native culture to some degree. (The screenplay by I  rritu and Mark L. Smith is  based in part  on Michael Punke s novel, which in turn was inspired by a historical episode.) But as someone may previously have observed, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Hugh represents the road not taken of peaceful cultural fusion, and Capt. Andrew Henry, the military officer in charge of his expedition (played by Domhnall Gleeson, who has had one hell of a year between this movie,  Ex Machina,   Brooklyn  and  The Force Awakens ) is presented as a decent and honorable man facing terrible circumstances. John Fitzgerald, Hardy s character, stands as the moral nemesis to both Henry and Glass, an overtly racist mercenary whose only interest is No. 1. But one of the cleverest subthemes of  The Revenant  is the suggestion that Fitzgerald may be the most honest and clear-headed of these guys. Once you accept his view of the world   Western expansion is a huge wealth-grab, driven by the wealthy and powerful; conflict between whites and Natives is inevitable   then everything he does is driven by logic rather than cruelty. Very minor spoiler coming: That includes Fitz s decision to abandon Glass in the wilderness after the latter has been critically wounded in that non-sexual ursine episode, even though he has been ordered to stay with the injured man (and promised a considerable payday for doing so). So there s a historical irony at work as Glass literally claws his way across the frozen wastelands of what will one day be called Montana or Wyoming, sleeping naked inside deer carcasses and outwitting drunken Frenchmen and begging scraps from doomed Pawnee wanderers and dodging an enraged Arikara chief whose daughter has been kidnapped by whites and isn t much interested in enlightened cultural dialogue. As Fitz actually tells Glass late in the film, the blood vengeance he seeks is thoroughly pointless, and arguably directed at the wrong target. It s a monumental performance by DiCaprio, even if he is playing a filthy, hirsute Frankenstein-monster version of the Roadrunner, with roughly the same amount of dialogue. If he wins his Oscar at last, I certainly have no objection. Gleeson and Hardy are also tremendous, and Lubezki s breathtaking long-take action scenes exemplify the positive effects of digital photography in mainstream cinema. (I remain unsure about  Gravity,  on the other hand.) But as nearly often happens in I  rritu s films, these elements operate at cross purposes and the point of the whole thing   the reason this movie was made, and the reason we re watching it   gets drowned beneath a series of memorable but disconnected images and moments. Furthermore, at least once in my life I would like to see a western that strives for complex portrayals of Native Americans without defaulting to a phony-baloney spiritual vision-quest toward the end of the second act, in which insects and amphibians speak, the dead return, beautiful maidens sit alone in a field of waving grass and the hero wakes at last, his fever broken. It s a sure sign that a filmmaker thought he had something to say but has lost track of it   we can stick with the masculine pronoun for this one   and that if he s not actually Terrence Malick making a Terrence Malick movie, he s in grave peril of becoming Kevin Costner making  Dances With Wolves.

5,EMK_Doc6_TheRevenant,"A confession: I didn t even like Birdman, which won Best Picture at the Oscars last year and best director for Alejandro G I  rritu. Despite the wizardry of the unbroken shooting and the bravura performance by Michael Keaton it was all about theatricality   and that jazz drumming soundtrack? Yet here is I  rritu back, with the same director of photography, Emmanuel Lubezki, who has himself taken the last two Oscars for cinematography, for Birdman and Gravity    and The Revenant is surely going to sweep all before it in this year s Academy Awards, including Best Actor for a brutally powerful performance by Leonardo DiCaprio. For this is a frontier story made as no other has been before. It s immense. It s based on a true story. In 1823 a scout called Hugh Glass, then about 50, signed up for an expedition to explore the Missouri river for fur-trapping, in the Rocky Mountains country held by Native American peoples. In what is now South Dakota he was savagely mauled by a grizzly bear and left for dead by the expedition, led by Captain Andrew Henry. But somehow he survived his terrible injuries and made his own way back, hundreds of miles, to the base near St Louis. A film has been made before of this story. Man in the Wilderness (1971) starred Richard Harris as Glass, was shot in Spain and is now forgotten, possibly for the best. More importantly, a fine and deeply researched novel about it, called The Revenant, was published in 2002 by Michael Punke, an historian and US government staffer, currently US Ambassador to the World Trade Organisation. The film states itself to be  based in part  on the novel; in fact, the screenplay by I  rritu and Mark L Smith, previously known for horror thrillers such as Vacancy and Vacancy 2, significantly alters the story both in its origins and its ending to heighten its impact. Glass had spent some time with the Pawnee, who gave him both the wilderness survival skills and the knowledge of Native American people that helped him no less. Here, he has a Native American wife and a son with her, Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), with him now on the expedition. In the prologue to the film, back in the past, they are cradled together after their village has been attacked.  I m right here,  says Glass,  you don t give up, you hear me, as long as you can still grab a breath, you keep breathing.  That will become his own challenge in his epic trek back to life. And then we are straight into present action. We see the fur traders  camp by the river lethally attacked by the Arikara tribe, a terrifying scene of confused violence, arrows suddenly piercing men through, replied to with the relatively unsophisticated guns of the time, knives and clubs. The randomness of death or survival in such a melee has never been better conveyed, largely due to the camerawork of Lubezki. Kinetic isn t word enough. Our viewpoint is never still, always moving, always right in there, so that you too are an actor in it all, not a safe observer, the long, amazingly fluid shots, achieved by some combination of cranes, hand-held work and Steadicam, and the latest digital cameras. This camerawork doesn t follow, it leads. I  rittu and Lubezki chose to shoot the film chronologically, to make the journey more real, and to rely entirely upon natural light, even in wintry Calgary and high Argentina. The result is almost hypnotic. Lubezki, like the production designer Jack Fisk and costume designer Jacqueline West, has worked extensively with Terrence Malick, including on his masterpiece about a first encounter between Europeans and Native Americans 200 years earlier, The New World   and The Revenant is in many ways a Malick film adjusted by another hand, full of passionate commitment to nature and spirituality, albeit driven by I  rritu s relentlessness, rather than succumbing to reverie and whimsy as Malick himself increasingly seems to do. But then he began his career by combining those tendencies with genre adventures, if never quite with such ferocity. Ten or so men out of 45 escape the attack, reaching the temporary safety of their boat. They include Glass, Hawk, Captain Henry (played with unexpected authority by Domhnall Gleeson), a boy called Bridger (the excellent young British actor Will Poulter) and a thug called Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), whom we have already seen abusing Glass and his  half-breed  son    a savage is a savage , he sneers. He is ruthless and dishonest and Hardy gives him scary substance with a most peculiar mumbling accent, again, but never mind. Glass tells the party their best chance of making it back is on foot, abandoning the boat and stashing the bundles of pelts that are the only real motive of their expedition. Then we follow Glass as he ventures alone into the deep coniferous forest, looking for game. He hears and sees a pair of bear cubs   and then the gigantic mother bear rushes him, mauling his back with her claws, biting his throat, savagely tossing him about, crushing him, all of this filmed continuously and utterly persuasively. She then wanders off to her cubs and Glass, despite his injuries, gets to his gun before she returns. But a single shot is not enough to stop a second attack of equal horror, the bear sniffing Glass s face intimately. He gets to his knife   and they roll down a slope together, the massive beast ending up on top of him. It s an astonishing sequence, giving the viewer no chance to think it s a construct. When the rest of the party come to the sound of the shot, one of them vomits at the sight of Glass s injuries.  The proper thing to do would be to finish him up quick   he ll be dead in an hour,  says Fitzgerald. But another begins roughly to sew his gaping wounds back together. The party tries to take him with them on a rough stretcher but in this snowy, mountainous country it proves impossible. Captain Hardy offers a bounty for three men to remain with him and give him a proper burial   Hawk and Bridger volunteer but the third man, bribed to stay, is the pitiless Fitzgerald. Glass ends up abandoned, bereaved, buried alive, but sustained by the will to take another breath, to return, to take vengeance. He crawls to his son s body and the camera comes so close the lens is fogged by his gasping breath, an effect that in other films might seem merely a technical mistake but given the role the camera plays here, the emphasis on having breath, it is far from that. The film, incidentally, has a tremendous soundtrack too, composed both of natural sounds and disciplined, inventive music by Ryuichi Sakamoto and Alva Noto. And so Glass s journey begins. Swaddled in hair and fur though he is, this is an absolutely magnificent performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, putting himself through it all in these huge wildernesses with implacable will, strength and resistance to pain and cold. He s a beast himself. The film does deviate at times into spiritual visions of his lost family (his Pawnee wife is played with a kind of wild joy by Gracey Dove) that seem a little over the top but it is otherwise so grounded in its location shooting and its dedication to telling the story of the Native American people as accurately as possible, alongside that of the invasive trappers, that these fantasy sequences can be allowed (as not in Birdman). For The Revenant is not only the story of one man s search for revenge but it is also fiercely about that little-told part of American history that ruined its native populations, well before the setting of Westerns as we usually know them. To be sure, it is a gruelling endurance test for the viewer too, alongside Glass in a world full of fur, meat and blood, as well as flowing water, wondrous skies, ice, snow and towering trees. But there we are: it s a masterpiece, unmissable.",EMK_Doc6_TheRevenant,EMK,Action,Positive,The Revenant
6,EMK_Doc7_TheRevenant,"The Revenant, a violent, visceral and yet transformational story of frontier-era survival and revenge, is  inspired  by the true story of historic American mountain man Hugh Glass. That means that this version of the story, with Leonardo DiCaprio emerging as a slam-dunk to earn a best actor Oscar nomination for his guts-out performance as Glass, is actually as much a fiction as much as it is fact. But no one should ever see a feature film thinking that it will be an absolutely authentic representation of anything from history. If it is a strong  spiritual  representation   with a realistic setting, proper period dialogue, accurate costuming and naturalistic performances   then that is the best we can and should ask for. In that case, The Revenant is a stunning piece of cinema because it offers all those qualities. The only reason that I am not ranking it even higher is that the brutal, bloody violence   however real that might be for a depiction of lawless frontier life of the 1820s   will drive some viewers out of the theatre, squirming in discomfort and emotional pain. Yes, it is that excessive, in particular in its disturbing and not wholly satisfying climax. That said, there is so much to like and admire and study closely, including DiCaprio s mature, committed, ruthless and yet empathetic performance. In addition, the technical achievements are remarkable. This includes Emmanuel Lubezki s raw cinematography, shooting exclusively with natural light, mostly on locations in western Canada during short winter days. Other scenes were filmed in the U.S. and   for the climax after the snow had melted in British Columbia   in southern Argentina. The Revenant is the latest American film from Mexican-born filmmaker Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, who personally won three Oscars for his work on Birdman and saw his masterwork win the top Academy Award as best picture of 2015. I doubt if The Revenant will repeat the shocking and wonderful triumph of Birdman. But it certainly will be nominated as best picture and many other cast and crew will be honoured with noms, too, DiCaprio not least among them. The saga of Hugh Glass has been explored repeatedly in the past. This film is based on the historic fiction, The Revenant, written by Michael Punke and published in 2002. Inarritu and Mark L. Smith are credited with co-authoring the screenplay. In this version, Glass does get attacked and nearly killed by a grizzly bear during a fur trapping expedition. That part is true. So are many details of the harrowing account of his survival and desire for revenge against the men who left him for dead. Much of the rest of the film, including his dead First Nations wife, his mixed-blood son and that youth s fate, and the surreal flashback scenes that Inarritu uses to heighten The Revenant into a magic realism reverie, are pure fiction and creative cinema. Glass represents a kind of progressive frontier man. His primary opponent, fellow trapper Thomas Fitzpatrick, represents the old order. He is racist, selfish, uneducated, brutish and a killer, at least as depicted here. Tom Hardy, in yet another of his stirring transformations, plays him unsparingly. Will Poulter s youthful work as future frontier legend Jim Bridger is our way inside the drama. One of the fascinating parts of The Revenant is the depiction of First Nations people. Unlike their appearances in the Hollywood movies of old, these varied peoples are shown neither as murderous vermin nor as noble savages. Instead, they are accorded the same complexities, with the same range of human emotions and qualities, as other peoples in the story. The difference is, as significant scenes demonstrate, the French and Euro-American trappers are the invaders and the First Nations people are defending their territories and natural resources. Inarritu shows what one chapter in that struggle might have been like, with iconic Hugh Glass caught in the midst of the violent madness as he crawls out of his grave.",EMK_Doc7_TheRevenant,EMK,Action,Positive,The Revenant
7,EMK_Doc8_TheRevenant,"Let s start with the bear attack, because it s one of the most amazing spectacles of the movie year 2015. On its own, it s reason enough to see  The Revenant,  and there are plenty of other reasons. For weeks, there have been rumors that the scene shows Leonardo DiCaprio getting sexually assaulted by a bear. That does not happen. What happens is even worse. DiCaprio plays a fur trapper, in 1820, out in the Northwest wilderness, who thinks it might be a good idea to shoot a couple of bear cubs. He doesn t notice the enormous mama bear running up behind him until he turns around just as he s getting pounced on. What follows is a scene that delivers in a number of extreme and wonderfully conflicting ways. It is harrowing. It is technically remarkable, because there is no doubt in any viewer s mind that DiCaprio really does have a bear throwing him around and stepping on his head. It is a beautiful piece of bear-fight choreography   it s clear that serious thought went into how this fight would progress for maximum impact. There s also just enough emotional distance for us to enjoy what s happening. The bear, after all, does have a point. And this distance allows us to notice and experience the scene s other great pleasure: It s funny. Bears are so cute and cuddly that to see one go berserk on a guy, particularly one who has it coming, has a certain absurd satisfaction.  The Revenant  is loosely based on the real story of Hugh Glass, an American fur trapper who was abandoned by his companions after the unfortunate bear incident and left to die. Despite infections and festering flesh, he somehow survived and navigated his way across 200 miles of hostile wilderness. It s an amazing survival tale, and the movie itself looks like a survival chronicle. That really is DiCaprio with ice stuck in his beard. That really is DiCaprio wading through and immersing himself in freezing water, over and over. Part of the pleasure of  The Revenant  is in watching freezing people from a warm, cushy seat in a theater. The film is directed by Alejandro I  rritu in a Terrence Malick ( The New World ) vein, with shots of the sky through the trees, silhouettes against the setting sun and omniscient overviews of the entire landscape. The difference is that with I  rritu, these are not occasions for philosophical contemplation. Instead, the sky might have arrows flying through it, signaling a new phase in an Indian battle. And the overviews, usually with some lone antlike figure in their midst, are there to remind you that this environment may be breathtaking, but people don t belong here. Like  Birdman,  and even more than  Birdman,   The Revenant  is a director s movie, a showcase for a filmmaker s vision and innovation. I  rritu employs long, complicated shots that make full use of the wide screen. Early in the movie, he films an Indian attack in ways that make you realize that every previous director has done it all wrong. The attack comes without warning, from all sides. A character starts calmly barking out orders and is killed mid-sentence. Every moment is a horrible surprise, which, of course, it would be. There is no safe place to look, no safe character to follow. Even a great innovator, though, has his limits, and in attempting to make an endlessly riveting film about a guy trying to crawl and limp for 200 miles, I  rritu has given himself a daunting assignment. He succeeds, in the sense that his 156-minute movie maintains interest, but the interest is maintained through a series of escalating catastrophes   Glass can t just go over one waterfall, but several   and stock action-movie situations, such as the lust for revenge. The fresh brilliance of the first hour fades into something more familiar. Tom Hardy exudes an awesome perversity as Glass  most villainous colleague, but he probably would be more effective if he got past the idea that doing an American accent means talking as if there were marbles in his mouth. Still, he s a terrific presence. DiCaprio doesn t get to say much in  The Revenant,  but he does get to cauterize a neck wound with gunpowder (don t try this at home), the most slapstick improvised health care procedure since Tom Hanks ( Cast Away ) extracted a tooth using an ice skate. And he does get to eat a live fish and dive face first into a buffalo liver. It s hard to talk about this as a performance, because there s nothing to compare it to. But if I were an Oscar voter, I might be tempted to vote DiCaprio best actor   or at least to propose a new category be inaugurated, the acting equivalent of the Purple Heart.",EMK_Doc8_TheRevenant,EMK,Action,Positive,The Revenant
8,EMK_Doc9_TheRevenant,"There's a scene in The Big Lebowski with Sam Elliott, in his cowboy hat, working a sarsaparilla, sitting alongside Jeff Bridges' the Dude. Elliott's the Stranger looks over at the Dude and his White Russian on the rocks and offers a drawling cowpoke koan: ""A wiser fellow than myself once said, 'Sometimes you eat the bear . . . and sometimes the bear, well, he eats you."" In The Revenant, the wild, woolly, transcendentally cinematic wilderness survival thriller, Leonardo DiCaprio's 19th-century fur trapper has his own facetime with a bear: a ferocious grizzly protecting her cubs. It's not a spoiler, really, to say who eats whom in Alejandro G. I  rritu's rip-roaring follow-up to his Oscar-winning Birdman. DiCaprio, bearded and bloodied, wears a bearskin through much of the movie. But the encounter is staggering - not just for DiCaprio's Hugh Glass, mauled and mutilated to within an inch of his life, but for the audience, beholding an interspecies confrontation rendered with unnerving realism. And the quiet beats between the violent combat - the parties stopping to take a breath, consider their fates - make it all the more visceral, suspenseful. Oscar for best bear fight: The Revenant (the title means someone who returns from the dead) wins hands-down. An epic tale of revenge set in the unforgiving and unendingly beautiful frontier of 1820s Montana and South Dakota (the film was shot, by the brilliant Emmanuel Lubezki, mostly in western Canada), The Revenant is exhilarating cinema. Tom Hardy, chewing his words in deep, guttural ways, is the other, craftier nemesis of the film. The British actor, minus the postapocalyptic bondage gear of Mad Max: Fury Road, plays John Fitzgerald, a fellow trapper who leaves Glass for dead in the middle of the woods. Woods ringed by attacking Arikara tribesmen. But Glass isn't dead, and haunted by visions of his deceased (American Indian) wife and his son, he somehow pulls his wounded self up and soldiers on. His purpose is without sway: Track Fitzgerald down and bring his life to an end. Although tonally and contextwise completely different from one another, there is much in common between I  rritu's The Revenant and Ridley Scott's The Martian. Both boast box-office stars with serious Oscar cred (Matt Damon and DiCaprio, costars, in fact, in Scorsese's The Departed), and both films offer accounts of almost superhuman strength, resilience, and resolve. Damon's astronaut, Mark Watney, doesn't have a cold-blooded killer to contend with (or a bear), but he does have to dig deep into his soul to find the will, and the wiles, to survive. Ditto DiCaprio's Glass. And nature is a force to be reckoned with, whether it's the brutal terrain of the Red Planet or the wintry forests, jagged mountains, and raging rivers of Big Sky country. In fact, one of the reasons to see The Revenant - and to see it on as big a screen as possible - is to take in the splendor and stunning majesty of these unspoiled landscapes. They are breathtaking. And they give I  rritu's film a spiritual quality, a life force looming over the mere humans trudging through the snow. Another reason: that there bear.",EMK_Doc9_TheRevenant,EMK,Action,Positive,The Revenant
9,EMK_Doc10_TheRevenant," The Revenant  is big in every way. It features a big performance from Leonardo DiCaprio that will likely win him his first Oscar. It s set in a huge, seemingly endless snowy wilderness. And it runs more than 2 1/2 hours. Beyond that, it s comprised of big moments upon big moments. All of which means, while it s a rich film, it s also something of an endurance test. Every time you think nothing worse could happen to poor Leo, something worse happens. Talk about not being able to catch a break. The film is directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarittu, who won three Oscars last year   best screenplay, director and picture   for the uncharacteristically goofy  Birdman.  Here he s traveling in more familiar, heavy territory with a raw tale, of revenge, redemption and isolation. Don t go expecting a lot of laughs. DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass, scout for a trapping expedition sent out to the wilds in 1820s northern America. Glass is accompanied by his half-Indian son, Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), and they are out hunting when a swarm of Indians attack the trappers, who are under the command of young officer Andrew Henry (Domnhall Gleeson). Glass and Hawk hurry back and join in the melee, which leaves dozens of the trappers dead. The survivors race to a boat and take off downriver, fully aware that the Indians can watch them from the shores and attack when the river narrows. The Indians, it turns out, are looking for the chief s daughter, who was taken in the night by white guys   but not these white guys. Unfortunately, the Indians don t know that. Glass convinces Henry that their safest bet is to get off the boat and hike across land, even though winter is settling in. The trappers do just that and Glass goes off to scout the area. He comes upon a mother bear and her cubs and, before he knows it, the mother is upon him. This is easily the greatest bear-mauling in film history. The bear shreds Glass and tosses him about like a rag doll. Then she takes a break to check out the kids only to come back for more, time and again. Luckily this gives Glass the opportunity to reach for his rifle, and then his knife. Eventually the bear is done, but Glass is grievously injured head to toe. The trappers find him and build a stretcher to carry him. But Glass can t speak and seems sure to die. Eventually one particularly disgruntled trapper, Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy, gritty as dirt), suggests they leave him behind to die. Henry won t agree to that, but he will leave a few men to care for Glass and then assumably bury him. Fitzgerald volunteers for the duty, waits a while, performs some dastardly deeds, and then leaves Glass behind to die. But Glass doesn t die. He lingers in the snow. And then he moves, painfully. And, unarmed, he begins a long, long journey battling man and nature, encountering calamity after calamity, with two things in mind: Surviving and killing Fitzgerald. Inarritu gets a bit too caught up in symbolic dreams and memories   he s directing with a capital D   but the long slog Glass endures is undeniably strong stuff and the beaten-down but never conquered Glass is near unrecognizable as the baby-faced movie star DiCaprio s been for so long.  The Revenant  is both draining and rewarding, and its power lingers long after its last gasp.",EMK_Doc10_TheRevenant,EMK,Action,Positive,The Revenant
180,JHS_Doc1_Oblivion,"In the opening sequence of Oblivion, the voice of Tom Cruise (playing the film s protagonist, Commander Jack Harper) creeps onto the soundtrack and painstakingly explains the precise details of the film s backstory. The year is 2077. The Earth is all but abandoned. An alien population known as Scavengers (Scavs for short) invaded the moon, which in turn nearly destroyed the earth. Most humans have moved to a space station. Drones and technicians like Harper roam the earth, and so on and son on. A metric ton of exposition is slammed into that opening sequence, but here s what s peculiar: at the beginning of the second act, after Jack discovers a hibernating astronaut (Olga Kurylekno) and saves her, he sits her down and gives her the whole spiel again. Why? Is this a safeguard in case people showed up late? Do they think we didn t get it the first time? I have a theory. As Cruise was explaining the whole movie again, my mind started to wander. (It had nothing better to do.) I found myself re-imagining the film, up to that point, without the Tom Cruise Explains It All voice-over   merely images of a ravished earth, followed by the jargon-heavy first act, establishing his work and daily routine. And guess what: in that one tiny alteration, the movie I made in my head was far superior to the one I was watching. Had we not been provided with that painfully labored exposition, had we been trusted to figure that info out for ourselves, or let it reveal itself organically (like when, say, he had to explain it to the astronaut), Oblivion could have been  well, it still wouldn t have been a great movie. But it would have been a far more interesting one. And I found myself wondering if co-writer/director Joseph Kosinski had put that voice-over in originally, or if it was the result of prodding by the suits, a la Blade Runner. But that s the trouble with mainstream science fiction filmmaking these days: there s no expectation that an audience is capable of putting things together or waiting for a payoff, and there certainly aren t many filmmakers or executives willing to take the risk. The problem, it seems, is the desire of those who greenlight movies to lump science fiction in with action, and it s easy to guess why: Star Wars. Before 1977, there were occasional crossovers, but for the most part, science fiction was a genre purely unto itself, concerned with alien invasions and post-apocalyptic scenarios and subtextual parallels. After Lucas mashed up spaceships and swashbucklers, sci-fi was never the same. This is not to say that there haven t been great sci-fi/action movies: the original Star Wars trilogy, of course, and the first two Terminators, and Aliens, and the first Matrix. But those films worked, to some extent, in spite of themselves   because the fundamental purposes of great science fiction and great action are so diametrically opposed. Great science fiction is brainy and smart, fueled by Big Concepts and Grand Ideas. Most action films (and there are exceptions) are about blowing things up, about things going fast, about delivering gunplay and wisecracks, but preferably without too much dialogue (which makes it more translatable to lucrative foreign markets). When a film like Oblivion tries to mash the two genres up and fails, it brings out the best in neither. Much has been made recently of the 45th anniversary of 2001: A Space Odyssey; it premiered on April 2 of 1968 and was released two days later. It surely does no modern moviemaker any favors to be compared to Kubrick, and even at its best, Oblivion is no 2001. (Nor is it a Moon, Silent Running, WALL-E, or Logan s Run, all of which it nakedly recalls.) But watching the kind of compromised, half-assed minotaur this movie was clearly reverse-engineered to be, you can t help but imagine the kind of concessions Kubrick s classic would have been subjected to in today s marketplace.  Stanley, what s with all the monkeys at the beginning? You re gonna lose the audience right away. You gotta explain that! And what s with the laser light show? Does somebody get high? Gotta show it! Speaking of showing things   maybe you ll think about putting in a scene with a baby early on, so we can get a handle on that giant baby at the end? No? Stanley where you goin ? Hang on, we haven t talked about the voice-over yet! ",JHS_Doc1_Oblivion,JHS,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion
181,JHS_Doc2_Oblivion," Oblivion  starts out as a last-man-on-earth film but soon becomes a game of  What s wrong with this picture?  By the time you know all the answers, you re wondering what went wrong with the movie. Although it looks spectacular and boasts some pungent ideas, the surprise-to-running-time ratio is out of whack. Tom Cruise acts more relaxed than usual as Jack Harper, Tech 49, the post-apocalyptic grease monkey who narrates the film. He tells us that after earthlings beat off an invasion from alien  Scavengers  (or just plain  Scavs ), Jack and the awesomely efficient Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) were dispatched to run an epic salvage job from a glittering condo in the clouds. They live in what must be the highest-rent district of the atmosphere, somewhere over the ruins of Manhattan. You see, the good guys won the war but lost the planet. After the Scavs cleverly wrecked the moon, catalyzing natural disasters, the humans went nuclear, destroying what was left of the environment. Under the orders of their mission commander, Sally (Melissa Leo), Jack and Victoria maintain  hydro-rigs  that suck up the planet s water for relocation to Titan, the largest moon of Saturn and the new home for Earth s population. With Victoria running the communications desk, Jack roams the Eastern seaboard in a  bubble ship  that resembles a souped-up, weaponized whirlybird. He rescues and repairs deadly flying drones that protect the hydro-rigs from what s left of the Scavs. The drones murder any Scavs they cast their digital eyes on. The war between Scavs and humans sounds like a valid description of what we see before our eyes, but you may have your doubts within minutes. Director Joseph Kosinski and his co-writers (William Monahan, Karl Gajdusek and Michael Arndt), try to play fair with the audience but tip their hands too quickly. Jack and Victoria are supposed to have had their memories wiped clean. But Jack gets recurring visions or dreams of Old New York, including meeting a woman (Olga Kurylenko) at the Empire State building. He vents his inexplicable nostalgia by covertly building a lakeside cabin where he dons a flannel shirt and a Yankees cap, listens to classic rock on vinyl (Led Zeppelin and Procol Harum), and keeps a library of rescued books. (It includes  A Tale of Two Cities    this film is weighted with Sydney Carton-like sacrificial gestures.) When Jack finds a new-grown flower and brings it back to base in a tin can, we re not shocked that Victoria tosses it out, blaming her fear of toxins. Riseborough plays her as an eerie vision of perfection, almost preternaturally precise. We know there s something off about Victoria, we just don t know what. She responds as if brainwashed to commander Sally s daily question,  Are you an effective team?  With so few characters on hand, it s a mistake for a tricky screenplay to plant so many clues early on. Not even dandy shoot-outs and breathtaking vistas can distract you from figuring out their general motivations. The oh-so-gradual revelations hem in the actors. Morgan Freeman brings his usual charismatic gravitas to the second half of the picture, but the movie s secret acting weapon all along is Leo as Sally. Leo turns an unflappable image and a coaxing voice into an insidious, goading presence on Victoria s console. This performer s gutsiness has a way of conjuring hidden dimensions in the most limited parts, like the investigator in last year s  Flight.  She brings a touch of grit to well oiled machines. We should respond to the mysteries-within-mysteries of  Oblivion  with the delight of children opening a stack of Russian nesting dolls. Sadly, the film lacks the necessary brilliance or grace or spark of originality. Sci-fi zealots might find it fun to count off the references to  La Jetee,   Planet of the Apes,   2001: A Space Odyssey,  and  The Empire Strikes Back.  But even they might consider this film s use of music heavy-handed. The score by the chic French electronic band M83 keeps thudding away; Kosinski lathers it on as if in a panic about holding our interest. In one chase scene the pounding stops just long enough for Jack to ask his passenger,  You OK?  The audience is not OK. It s an art crime that a film so pretty to watch is such hell on the ears.",JHS_Doc2_Oblivion,JHS,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion
182,JHS_Doc3_Oblivion,"It takes more than an hour for Oblivion to become whatever it is the filmmakers think it s supposed to be. But when that whatever arrives (and even before it does) the movie works as an experience that glorifies the megaplex ideal. I watched it in a very good IMAX theater in suburban Philadelphia that, like all IMAX theaters, had a guardrail sitting at the bottom of the screen. It seemed to be there expressly to prevent you from entering one of Tom Cruise s pores. Fully overwhelmed in IMAX might be the only way to watch this movie. It s been shot with a crispness that elevates the heart rate. Projected at that scale, you want to leave your seat and explore this postnuclear Earth, to walk the film s sands and marvel at the manner in which the geological table has been so fantastically upended that Manhattan erodes beneath dunes and decays at the base of canyons. (The year is 2073.) Oblivion oscillates between sites that are way up high and locations that are way down low, between the astral dark of outer space and the flashlit dankness of long-abandoned caves. Even at IMAX scale it remains thrillingly impossible to detect whether the orb-like drones that accompany Jack Harper, the wistful repairman Cruise plays, have true tactility or whether they re just projections from a hard drive. The drones perform surveillance, they re armed to the teeth, and their resemblance to eyeballs is a clever formal manifestation of their function, which is to hunt and exterminate aliens for an ominous entity called the Tet, whose twangy operations commander, Sally, is played by a scratchy video uplink of Melissa Leo. The orbs have a rapport with Jack that gives you that Blade Runner replicant feeling about him. They break; he fixes them. When Jack and, by extension, the orbs happen upon a tiny survivalist civilization of human rebels   they re the  aliens,  and they re called Scavs   the orbs descend and instigate a fantastic firefight. Tremendous care has gone into making you believe that the orbs are whizzing around, flying into beams, and machine-gunning everyone. No matter its actual provenance, this ruined and depopulated Earth often feels breathtakingly real. But there s too much time to realize that what Oblivion cares about most is how good it looks. The director and cowriter Joseph Kosinski is a trained architect and visual-effects designer who wrote the graphic novel that became this movie. His expertise is in vastness and scale. He knows how to fill the camera frame and can orchestrate chaos and elaborate movement so that your ability to follow it is simple and your nervous system s response to its intensity is involuntary. His meticulousness is as painstaking as it was in Tron: Legacy, another grand optical illusion that kept confusing commercial vanity with philosophical wonder. There he made light something you want to lick and wear and put inside you. Oblivion is something you want to be inside of. Upon entry, you d have plenty of room to notice how hollow it is. Kosinski devotes the first hour to setting up Jack s workaday life. He lives atop a single-unit tower on Earth and wakes up with his English assistant and maybe-girlfriend, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough)   because this is also a Tom Cruise movie, the studio is almost contractually obligated to let him do this waking shirtlessly. Jack hops into his high-tech jet craft and sets out to repair drones. He visits a cabin from his pre-apocalypse life. He s nearly captured by mysterious forces far underground in what looks a lot like the New York Public Library. He discovers a woman (Olga Kurylenko) in NASA gear who could be his remnant wife and he is discovered by the Scavs, a race of impossibly chic renegades (so much strategically placed rubber! So many paramilitary knits!) whose leader is Morgan Freeman, an actor who s never needed to look cool. But in a cape and a pair of steampunk sunglasses, he now looks like he s waiting to make the Mothership Connection. The Scavs need Jack to help them strike back against the Tet, and poor Jack has no idea what to do. There are three problems with this setup. The first is that it takes too long to get to striking back. Watching Jack and Victoria pass the time, with her communicating with Sally and him roving for drones, is not as interesting as Kosinski believes. You need soulfulness for these sorts of longueurs, not math or circuitry. The second is that the business with Mrs. Harper is confusing more than it is intriguing: The Tet has wiped Jack s memory; but what he does remember of her and of Manhattan is generic placeholder stuff, like the photo that comes with a picture frame. This, of course, leads to the third problem: Kosinski might have heightened senses of sound and vision, but he s got no feel for interesting people. The ominous humanness the drones achieve   along with the repeated sight of the iconic coin-ooperated viewfinder on the observation deck of the now-trashed Empire State Building   is the most interesting surprise in this movie. This is science fiction with state-of-the-art production and sound design, smart if absurdly fashionable costumes, boundless cinematography, and, eventually, Morgan Freeman. But for all the time and care and money that went into the physical details, it s astonishing so little ostensible attention was paid to writing an equally well-realized movie. Kosinksi is a filmmaker of the Christopher Nolan mold   a pop-art engineer. They re both shallow and anti-psychological, but Nolan has a rippling shallowness; he can skim a rock across the surface of a puddle. He can do a lot with superficiality and genericness. Kosinski doesn t appear to be up to anything. The use of drones that hunt in caves for people who are rumored to be aliens doesn t have enough development to achieve the full weight of allegory. The Tet is a giant game piece that s been designed in a way that resembles the old Viacom logo and shares a name with a Vietnamese holiday   and the deadly Vietcong military campaign that happened on that day. But it has a woman s voice and opens and closes crypto-vaginally. But only for Cruise, which must be a metaphor for something. (The movie does some other comical flirting with misogyny, too.) Cruise is his reliable self. His determination to give us our money s worth might represent the most intense and intensely ridiculous professional commitment in the history of the movies. It s hard not to love a man who loves us as much as Cruise does. He just has no chemistry with anyone else. Kurylenko is a beauty, but she brings with her a Bond-girlishness that has little to do with Cruise (she s currently being better used opposite Ben Affleck in Terrence Malick s To the Wonder). And in IMAX, you fear that, in the Hollywood constellation, her exoticness might be a redundancy   that she might be Catherine Zeta-Cotillard. More important is that Cruise is not the sort of star who can keep you rapt just bobbing around ruins and being a kind of average. This might be where the Charlton Hestons and Will Smiths of the world have him beat. Going less than 15 miles an hour diminishes Cruise s power. At this point, it no longer makes sense for him to keep making science fiction movies, anyway. He still looks naturally 30. He is science fiction. The arrivals of Mrs. Harper and the Scavs threaten to take the movie somewhere interesting. For one thing, Victoria frigidly freaks out into a way that takes full advantage of Riseborough s insinuating attentiveness. But then the characters begin doubling, and time seems to fold in on itself only so that the audience can go home in a state of satisfied confusion instead of scratching its head in bewildered misery. Kosinski deploys the most banal emblems. At one point, two characters stare at Andrew Wyeth s Christina s World   the painting in which a young woman sits at the bottom of a hillock and gazes, with her back to us, at a distant house   and one says the painting reminds her of home. What does she mean? It s like staring at a glass of water and saying it reminds you of being wet. That kind of flatfooted cultural imagination pervades the whole movie. Jack goes to that cabin and puts on a Yankees cap, which, in some corners of the universe, might signify the opposite of humanity. Later, at the cabin, Mrs. Harper puts on a record intended to mean a lot to Jack: It s  A Whiter Shade of Pale,  which has shown up in so many movies and commercials that it no longer means anything to us. Oblivion is so much like and influenced by so many other movies that it doesn t top or transcend   The Matrix, I Am Legend, Planet of the Apes, Star Wars, Aliens, Vertigo, Cloud Atlas, Inception, An Affair to Remember. Kosinski rejects the wondrous foreboding of 2001 or WALL-E. Oblivion sells the bogus upside of doom. There s also a desert sequence that bring back sleepy memories of last year s John Carter and how this could have been Jack Harper, but Kosinski really does have a talent for hypnotizing you with production. This is what John Carter could have been, and yet Oblivion could have been so much more. Kosinski doesn t build a new world. He s just reupholstered a bunch of old ones.",JHS_Doc3_Oblivion,JHS,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion
183,JHS_Doc4_Oblivion,"Earth, 2077. Sixty years earlier, alien invaders had blown up our moon, and an intergalactic battle ensued.  We won the war but lost the planet,  says Jack Harper (Tom Cruise), a kind of grease-monkey pilot whose job is to repair the drones that monitor desolate Earth while the rest of humanity lives in a remote space station. His coworker and assigned girlfriend Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) directs Jack s flying sorties over the wreckage of Manhattan, which may literally be a no-man s land. Yet as he lies in bed with Victoria, Jack has visions of another, mysterious woman (Olga Kurylenko), from his fantasies or his past.  I know you, but we ve never met. I m with you and I don t know your name. I know I m dreaming, but it feels like more that. It feels like a memory. How can that be?  And how is it that science-fiction films imagine the worst for our future while steeped in love-loss for our past? Perhaps because the genre blossomed, as literature and then cinema, in the late 1940s   the time of the Cold War and the first nuclear age   when our world s two great powers played a deadly game of mutually assured destruction, and when fearing the prospect of human extinction was not paranoia, just common sense. It s no wonder that any time before the Bomb seemed Edenic to sci-fi writers, readers and movigoers; any time after might spell The End. The same warm ache of nostalgia envelops the Jack of 2077, the hero of Joseph Kosinski s oh-so-serious Oblivion, for the pre-invasion Earth of 2017. He stands at the top of the Empire State Building, most of it covered in sand and rubble, wanders through the caverns of the New York Public Library on 42nd Street (only eight blocks away from King Kong s final perch but miraculously not buried) and patrols Yankee Stadium, scene of the very last World Series. He saves old books, a catcher s mitt and baseball and some LPs from the 1960s and  70s; Procol Harum keeps playing on his internal iTunes. Fixating on the 1948 Andrew Wyeth painting Christina s World, and on his dream girl, Jack finds a verdant interior life in this wasteland by mixing memory and desire. His poetic guide, though, is not Eliot but Macaulay, whose famous couplet in The Lays of Ancient Rome    And how can man die better than facing fearful odds, / For the ashes of his fathers, and the temples of his Gods     haunts Jack like a long-ago pop tune or a distant battle cry. Oblivion must be the only science-fiction film that borrows substantially from I Am Legend, WALL-E and Sleepless in Seattle   itself a remake of 1957 s An Affair to Remember, which was a remake of 1939 s Love Affair. In fact, everything in this movie keeps looking backward. Victoria warns Jack that  Our job is to not remember. Remember?  That s the cue for this company man with a rebellious streak to find his future in the past, to decide if he s fishing for  memory or waking up inside of a dream. Jack must attend to the dual meaning of  oblivion :  nothing  and  forgetfulness.  If we ve misplaced our memories, we ve lost ourselves. The movie s trailer and poster have alerted viewers that Jack and Victoria are not alone on Earth. Morgan Freeman briefly emerges from the underworld as a Zeus-Hades insurgent, sporting sunglasses and chomping on a cigar. (Where d he find that   in a subterranean smoke shop?) Melissa Leo, with a fake-syrupy Southern accent, is seen on Riseborough s screen as a mid-level operative back at Mission Control. And Kurylenko, also in theaters now as Ben Affleck s whirling wife in Terrence Malick s To the Wonder, eventually shows up in person when Jack rescues her from a shot-down spaceship on which she had taken a long cryogenic nap. (No surprise: she looks great.) But Oblivion is still so underpopulated that. when Jack requires a suitable rival for a bare-knuckles fight, it s a clone of himself. Kosinski, the 3-D graphics whiz who has a Master s degree in architecture from Columbia University, made his feature-film debut with the 2010 Tron: Legacy (a sequel-remake that also hopscotches through time). Oblivion shows that Kosinski certainly has an eye for spiffy shapes   the sleek watchtower, the collapsible metallic grandeur of Jack s aircraft, the platoon of drones with one glowering red eye and the frowny face of a Pac-man goblin  amid a ravishingly barren landscape. Indeed, the juggling of opposites is this director s game: to make an artistic statement while indulging his star s need to be a Top Gun aerial ace, a moto-bike demon and an old-fashioned romantic swain. Cruise nearly carries it off. At 50, with a few becoming facial creases but also looking cryogenically preserved, he is still the boyish action star, a perpetual-motion machine who s been told No so many times he s stopped listening and leaped into the enthralling unknown. The extreme closeups that find only generic worry in Riseborough s face are kind to Cruise; he instinctively knows how to communicate to an audience through a possibly thoughtful stare. (We haven t seen the old-young smiling Tom on the big screen for ages; he s taken Will Smith s lead and traded in his trademark grin for a world-weary grimace.) After playing the dessicated Stacee Jaxx in Rock of Ages, and the hobo sleuth in Jack Reacher, Cruise completes his Jack trilogy as Harper, spelunking inside the crevices of his memory or fantasy. The exigencies of Cruise s participation demand fights and flights. We get one pretty cool space dogfight, as Jack plays bumper cars with a flotilla of enemy aircraft, and one lame one that s way too reminiscent of, and less thrilling than, the climactic chase in the original Star Wars. Rule for sci-fi directors: No more aerial Indy 500-style battles in narrow canyons. But the biggest collision in Oblivion   one Kosinski may not have intended   is between the feverish action scenes and the slowness, we might say torpor, of the rest of the film. For all the shouting and swooning, characters don t connect; and by the end, when all the clones and drones are accounted for, science-fiction entropy has given way to audience ennui. Six minutes or 60 years after seeing the movie, viewers are unlikely to remember it. In space, Jack hopes, someone may hear you dream. But in a movie theater, no one will see you yawn.",JHS_Doc4_Oblivion,JHS,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion

185,JHS_Doc6_Oblivion,"Squirming through the Tom Cruise sci-fi vehicle Oblivion, I flashed back to Notting Hill, in which Julia Roberts plays a superstar visiting London to promote some deadly outer-space epic with white-on-white sets and a sleep-inducing hum. Oblivion is like that movie-within-a-movie: Everything in it feels 100 percent inauthentic. That vibe, as it happens, turns out to be intentional. But when the humans arrive, it s still a narcotic. The pity is that the film is about the war to liberate the human spirit from alien soul-snuffing exploiters and that Cruise is supposed to be our last best hope. In the long opening voice-over, his character, Jack (not Reacher), explains that  Scavengers  obliterated humankind: They blew up the moon and Nature did the rest. Humans beat the invaders back and then took off en masse to colonize a moon of Saturn, Titan. But a few people stayed behind to harvest the remaining resources and watch out for leftover  Scavs.  Jack is teamed with a Brit named Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), who sits in a giant mushroomlike flight tower reading data from  hydro rigs  and lethal drones. He flies around doing repairs and calling in those drones whenever there are signs of saboteurs. He also tells us that his memory has been wiped so that he won t spill any beans if grabbed by Scavs. Director Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy) thinks big   big white impersonal settings on a big barren landscape under a big fractured moon with one big segment broken off and simply hanging, suspended in orbit, with a trail of little pieces floating around. But the sets just sit there. The first half-hour is Jack talking to Victoria on his headset, Jack fixing rigs, and Jack having sex with the eager-beaver Victoria. (Wow, does she want him.) They talk longingly of their imminent departure for Titan. Victoria speaks to an administrator on a screen called Sally (Melissa Leo). These scenes exert a strange fascination: They re so conscientiously neutral, so droningly dull that they almost pass for Stanley Kubrick like. But Jack shares our boredom. He feels dislocated. He has visions of himself atop the Empire State Building with another woman   someone more compelling than his vaguely robotic partner. Someone played by Olga Kurylenko, this year s comely avatar of spirituality. When Jack finds a crashed spaceship with human passengers (including Olga) in suspended animation and a drone flies in and starts blasting them, he s flummoxed. Drones are supposed to kill Scavs, not humans! And certainly not Olga! Eventually, Jack is captured by beings who look like humans (but you never know), led by Morgan Freeman, who puffs happily on a cigar   and you would, too, if you had to do as little for a paycheck this size. He says he was intrigued when Jack found a book with a poem by Macaulay in which three Romans sacrifice themselves to save their city. That s when things get murky. I eventually figured out Oblivion, but not while watching it. While watching it, I said,  What? What?  over the din of the explosions. It was Wikipedia s Oblivion entry that spelled out what was happening in the final flashback. And some but not all of my questions were answered on an IMDb board in which posters argued over whether the problem was our lack of attention spans or atrocious screenwriting. I have honed my attention span on three-hour Romanian pictures and the oeuvre of Tarkovsky and Tarr. My attention span is dandy. Was Cruise trying to beat out fellow Scientologist John Travolta for the honor of starring in the dumbest sci-fi epic ever? Thank heavens, he lost   nothing will ever be as shatteringly inane as the L. Ron Hubbard based Battlefield Earth. But joining forces with the director of Tron: Legacy was like checking  d  on the form that said,  I want my space movies more (a) incoherent, (b) plodding, (c) migraine-inducing, or (d) all of the above.  Oblivion spins the same kind of paranoid futuristic fantasy as Battlefield Earth, in which a man must learn the true nature of his identity: that his body is but a temporary vessel, his soul immortal. Only then can he take on an evil empire of plundering anti-individualists from an unnamed planet that sounds like Xenu. Cruise was on a roll for a while with Magnolia and his two Spielberg pictures   his acting was grounded. But he must be shedding brain cells like wives. After all of these years, he still indicates rather than feels, signaling thought by wrinkling his brow and squinting real hard and looking like a caveman encountering fire for the first time. He looks less like mankind s savior than like a harbinger of devolution   the last stage before we re back at lungfish.",JHS_Doc6_Oblivion,JHS,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion
186,JHS_Doc7_Oblivion,"Science fiction is always more about the present, and even the past, than it is about the future, which by definition we don t know anything about. That s certainly true of  Oblivion,  the sly, surprising and visually magnificent Tom Cruise vehicle that has forced me   and many other people, I suspect   to revise my first opinion of director Joseph Kosinski. In fact, on some bizarre level  Oblivion  feels like a more grown-up and vastly improved version of Kosinski s murky and ludicrous  TRON: Legacy,  a movie I compared to sticking your head into a barrel of ink full of fluorescent glow-sticks. Like that movie,  Oblivion  incorporates all sorts of themes, ideas and images from science-fiction cinema of the last several decades, including  Blade Runner,   The Matrix,   Total Recall,   2001: A Space Odyssey  and Andrei Tarkovsky s  Solaris,  among others. It explores nearly the same territory of loss, loneliness and rediscovery, but the philosophical veneer and the reverent design aesthetic fit a whole lot better when the whole story doesn t take place inside a 1980s video game. I m sure some people will see  Oblivion  as another Philip K. Dick rehash -- to be clear, it's not based on any of his material -- but to my mind Kosinski and co-writers Karl Gajdusek and Michael Arndt have synthesized all these influences into a witty and elegant post-apocalyptic parable that s well suited to our age of asymmetrical warfare and even asymmetrical reality. (One could indeed steer a discussion of  Oblivion  toward a discussion of the limits of political knowledge and global understanding   but not before you ve seen the movie.) We begin on, or just above, the surface of an abandoned and nearly dead planet, which happens to be our beloved third rock from the sun. It s the 2070s, and Jack (Cruise), our hero, explains in an opening voice-over that some years earlier the human race fought a total war against an alien race known as the Scavs. These invaders had first blown up the Moon   and indeed we can see it, a horizontal streak of rubble across the sky -- wreaking havoc with the tides and immensely destructive changes in the climate. While the Scav invasion was eventually repelled, the victory required the use of most of Earth s nuclear arsenal, leaving most of the planet uninhabitable. Most surviving humans have apparently been airlifted to a gigantic triangular spacecraft called the Tet, where they await evacuation to Titan, Saturn s largest moon, to begin a new civilization. Jack and Victoria (the chilly, leggy Andrea Riseborough), who s both his co-worker and his sexual partner, are technicians posted to a sleek, chic sky-pod that doubles as command center and living quarters   think Le Corbusier plus a 1979 layout from Architectural Digest plus Playboy magazine   mounted on a pole a few hundred meters above the Earth s surface. They re only there on a short-term assignment, mostly to monitor and repair the drones who hunt down bands of surviving Scavs and protect the giant nuclear reactors that suck up seawater and send power to the Tet. Victoria and Jack both know they ve had their previous memories wiped, so that if they re captured by the Scavs they can t reveal any important operating info about the Tet. But Jack has started having peculiar dreams and fragments of memory, seemingly from a prewar Earth society he isn t old enough to remember. So we know from the very first scene that something s wrong with this picture. But Kosinski takes his time with this resplendent vision of massive desolation and isolated luxury, slowly building an atmosphere of menace, uncertainty and even sadness. Even aspects of the film that seem arbitrary or poorly thought-out (why does Victoria get dolled up in skirt and heels to man a communications console?) come into focus eventually. As Jack patrols the awe-inspiring and sometimes heartbreaking landscape of a devastated planet   which recalls the  Planet of the Apes  movies, to be sure, but also Stephen Vincent Ben t s classic short story  By the Waters of Babylon     Oblivion  veers awfully close to the contemplative mode, especially for a Hollywood spectacle that reportedly cost more than $100 million. I mean that as high praise, and Claudio Miranda s photography and the magnificent retro-moderne production design of Darren Gilford are well worth contemplation. But it s likely some viewers will become impatient for the plot to kick into gear and the action scenes to cut loose. In due course, they do   but there s a limited amount I can tell you about that. Adapting his own graphic novel (originally written with Arvid Nelson), Kosinski handles the flow of information in  Oblivion  with confidence. We realize from the outset that Jack s dreams and memories reflect some underlying reality, and that he and Victoria don t understand the whole story of the Tet and the Scavs and the war. And it s obvious that Sally (Melissa Leo), the chatty-bossy hardass Southern belle who talks to them from the Tet, knows a great deal more than she s telling them. Still, even after Jack rescues Julia (Olga Kurylenko), the lone survivor of a crashed spacecraft whose crew has been in suspended animation for decades, and learns some surprising facts about her mission, you still won t put it all together. Since every poster for this movie has Morgan Freeman in it, I m probably OK saying that he and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (of  Game of Thrones ) show up as the leaders of a renegade band of humans   and that they and Julia aren t the only living people Jack finds on the planet. If a lot of the second half of  Oblivion  is fairly standard action cinema   a guy and a girl, on the run and looking for answers   their setting and situation is always visually striking. Whatever you make of Tom Cruise as a person or personality, he has a sharp eye for material and understands his own limits; in the last couple of years he s homed in on playing the iconic Troubled Guy Who Knows Too Much. This is at least the third strong Cruise performance in a row, after  Mission: Impossible   Ghost Protocol  and  Jack Reacher  (hell, let s throw in  Knight and Day,  even though it wasn t a hit). Is it possible or plausible that the metaphorical, David vs. Goliath level of  Oblivion  will strike some deep cultural and political chord, the way the Wachowskis did in 1999 with the first  Matrix ? Not really   that layer of the movie is in there, for those who yearn for it, but  Oblivion  is a much cooler movie, temperature-wise, not bursting with ideas in quite the same way and much more a visual tribute to the world of Tarkovsky and R.W. Fassbinder.  Oblivion  is a technical triumph rather than a philosophical breakthrough, demonstrating how beautifully digital effects can be blended with real people and real sets, demonstrating that neither Tom Cruise nor the 1970s will ever die, and announcing the unexpected arrival of a major science-fiction director.",JHS_Doc7_Oblivion,JHS,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion
187,JHS_Doc8_Oblivion,"These days it seems rare to encounter a big sci-fi movie that s not a remake, a sequel, a prequel or an adaptation of a well-known property (whether a novel, a comic book or even a toy). The new Tom Cruise film  Oblivion  is an exception: This story of a solitary drone repairman on a devastated future Earth grew out of director Joseph Kosinski s ( Tron: Legacy ) own unpublished graphic novel. According to a number of lukewarm reviews, however, the film s originality is undercut by its derivativeness, as it borrows liberally from the sci-fi canon. In one of the more positive reviews, The Times  Kenneth Turan calls  Oblivion  a  throwback to the days when on-screen science fiction was about speculative ideas rather than selling toys to tots. But, he adds,   Oblivion  is not perfect. Its dystopian story makes no apologies for its familiarity, echoing such films as  The Planet of the Apes,   The Matrix,   2001' and even  Wall-E.   The film does benefit, Turan says, from Kosinski s  sleekly futuristic  visuals and a solid performance from Cruise,  essential in bringing conviction and credibility to this made-up world.  Claudia Puig of USA Today agrees that   Oblivion  is a slick spectacle  and  Cruise s performance as Jack Harper is the best of the lot.  On the other hand,  The plot s muddled internal logic leaves some substantial holes,  and the film is  startlingly derivative as Kosinski   draws from a grab bag of sci-fi predecessors, including  Wall-E,   Total Recall,   Planet of the Apes  and  The Matrix.   Ultimately, Puig says,  neither the sci-fi or the vague political commentary are involving.  The New York Times  Manohla Dargis writes,  The problem with  Oblivion    is that it s been stitched together from bits and pieces that evoke numerous other, far better far-out tales and ideas, conceits and characters from the likes of Philip K. Dick, the Wachowskis, J.G. Ballard and Duncan Jones.   No matter how hard Mr. Cruise squares his jaw or flings his body over and against the scenery, and despite the presence of Morgan Freeman, Olga Kurylenko and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who trickle into the story to aid in Jack s journey,  Oblivion  never transcends its inspirations to become anything other than a thin copy.  The Chicago Tribune s Michael Phillips says,  The movie s not bad for a while, but it s made of spare parts from a lot of other movies, among them  Total Recall,   2001: A Space Odyssey,  the  2001' riff  Moon,  a certain recent play by Caryl Churchill (can t say; spoiler) and a few others.  Writing for CNN, Tom Charity calls the film  glossy, derivative, ambitious and fatally underpowered.  He continues:  if you poured all the most memorable sci-fi films from the past half century into a blender, from  2001: A Space Odyssey  and the original  Planet of the Apes  all the way down to last year s  Prometheus,  you would probably wind up with something very similar and equally synthetic   though quite possibly more exciting.  Similarly, Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly writes,  I would describe the movie as a mash-up of  The Matrix,   Blade Runner,  and  Planet of the Apes,  but that makes it sound better than it is.  The film is  stylishly directed,  Nashawaty says, but in the end,  all the eye candy in the world can t mask the sensation that you ve seen this all before   and done better. Too bad the movie s script wasn t given the same attention as its sleek, brave-new-world look.  In other words, according to critics,  Oblivion  is never greater than the sum of its parts.",JHS_Doc8_Oblivion,JHS,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion
188,JHS_Doc9_Oblivion," Oblivion  looks marvelous, in the deliciously dystopian way of so many post-apocalyptic films. It s set in 2077, after alien invaders called Scavengers (or  Scavs ) have laid waste to our moon, leading to cataclysmic floods and earthquakes that have ravaged Earth. The film features gorgeous CGI shots of such broken, half-buried landmarks as the Washington Monument and the Empire State Building, whose observation deck can now be accessed by walking onto it from a mountain of rubble. It s the kind of film that s perfect for the Imax format in which some theaters are offering it. Just be warned that this means it s also very, very loud. One joker at a preview screening shouted,  Volume!  as the film was barely getting under way, to much laughter. He wasn t complaining that it was too quiet. It ought to look good. The movie, by director Joseph Kosinski ( Tron: Legacy ), is said to be based on a graphic novel by Kosinski and comic book writer Arvid Nelson. Although that book was never published   and probably never will be   the mock-up of the story drew the attention of star Tom Cruise, along with not one, but two, studios. Disney, which originally had the rights, ultimately gave them up to Universal, which made the film. It s an engrossing, if complicated and twisty, story, with plentiful sci-fi action and a provocative subtext about the nature of the human soul. At times, however, the balance between those two things feels off. Some of the fight sequences, which involve robotic flying  drones  mounted with guns, go on a bit longer than is strictly necessary. Cruise plays Jack Harper, a futuristic maintenance man whose dangerous job consists of repairing the drones that patrol Earth, an unpopulated wasteland where giant  hydro rigs  convert seawater into energy to be used by what s left of the human race, which has relocated to a colony on one of Saturn s moons. Although we ve won the war against the Scavs, there are still some left, and they like to sabotage the hydro rigs and the drones almost as much as they enjoy trying to kill Jack. He and his partner/lover, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), who provides backup from a command center in the clouds, have their work cut out for them, but it s more routine than glamorous.  We re the mop-up crew,  Jack says. All is not as it appears, however. That scenario, as laid out by Jack in voice-over narration, soon starts to show cracks. The Scavs  terrorist-style activities pick up, and a spacecraft loaded with humans in suspended animation crash-lands on Earth, drawn by an electronic beacon emanating from the surface. It s suddenly as if the order of Jack s world is turned upside down, including his understanding of who the good guys and the bad guys are. Even Jack and Victoria s boss, Sally (Melissa Leo), who supervises their work from an orbiting satellite called the Tet, starts to seem not quite so maternal as she did at the beginning of the film. More important, Jack starts to question his own identity; indeed, the very nature of identity itself. It s worth noting that, although Jack and Victoria underwent mandatory  memory wipes  that erased everything they knew before starting these jobs, Jack is plagued by strange dreams of a pre-war Earth   a time when he wouldn t even have been born   and of a beautiful but mysterious woman (Olga Kurylenko). The film s big reveal is satisfying but requires some mental effort. This is not a movie during which you should fall asleep. Fortunately, there s not much chance of that.  Oblivion  is fast-paced and exciting. As for the elephant in the room, it must be said that going to a Tom Cruise movie these days is more complicated than it used to be. The real-world baggage that this sometimes kooky tabloid staple brings to the screen is, for many, harder to ignore than it is with other movie stars, with the possible exception of Lindsay Lohan. That said, Cruise makes for a fine and even appealing action hero, perhaps because his character is someone without an apparent past. It s as if  Oblivion  is inviting us to undergo our own memory wipes before seeing the film. If you re able to forgive and forget,  Oblivion  isn t a bad place to start loving Tom Cruise all over again.",JHS_Doc9_Oblivion,JHS,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion

170,JGS_Doc1_LegallyBlonde,"Clueless and Dick gave the dumb-blonde tradition (think Sandra Dee) new life in the Nineties, showing some sharp social and political comedy gleaming out at the roots. Legally Blonde isn't nearly as smart -- no talons underneath this Lee Press-On Nails production -- but it still makes for a giggly good time. Witherspoon plays sorority girl Elle Woods, recently dumped by her slick, eyes-on-the-Oval-Office boyfriend for being  Marilyn  material, and not the Jackie O. he needs to ascend to office. Undaunted, Elle applies (and is admitted) to Harvard Law School in order to impress her ex, who's also enrolled there. Of course, the powerfully pink Elle doesn't fit in with all those Harvard stiffnecks -- she's quickly dubbed Malibu Barbie by her classmates -- but her ingenuity and intuition land her a coveted internship at a law firm. There, she's called upon to solve a murder involving a fitness queen and former Delta Nu sister. When material is as intentionally ridiculous as this, there's a certain tacit suspension of disbelief. Moviegoers are allowed, even required, to turn off their bullshit radars: no squabbling over plot contrivances (of which Legally Blonde has many) or with characters who are simply caricatures of real life (with whom Legally Blonde is teeming). But even with that cushion, the film is still sloppily executed. The script, while loaded with some hearty laughs, simply takes jokes one step too far, like someone needling an elbow to your side, saying,  Get it?  The camerawork is unstirring, and first-time feature director Robert Luketic uses Southern California to stand in for Boston that, while very nice to look at, is lazily incongruous with Boston's actual changing seasons. (One dead giveaway: Elle looks out a window at some pretty [fake] snow falling -- no doubt concocted on an L.A. soundstage -- that is quickly followed by a lovely exterior shot of  Cambridge  in which the foliage shows barely a hint of fall's changing colors, and not a lick of snow to be had.) Nitpicky? Maybe. But the most criminal element of Legally Blonde is how underused the fine supporting cast is. The kookily comic Selma Blair (as a Harvard priss) is reduced to a drab, sulky, mulchlike thing. And Luke Wilson, looking more and more like Deputy Dawg, is wasted in another second-banana, boy-toy gig, following similar turns in Charlie's Angels and Dog Park. Legally Blonde gives him little to do than mug aw-shucks-like (to his credit, his  aw-shucks  could rival an early Jimmy Stewart in its earnest affability). So, with so much wrong how could Legally Blonde still come off meringue-pie right? That honor goes entirely to the priceless twitter and tart of Reese Witherspoon. She makes a throwaway character terrifically likable, and transforms a 90-minute, pretty dumb dumb-blonde joke into an hour and a half set for a comedienne coming into herself, further refining the snap-crackle-and-pop timing she first showed off in Alexander Payne's brilliant Election. Legally Blonde may toss Witherspoon a mighty slim bone to work with, but somewhere in that chirpy half-pint frame dwell some meaty comic chops. Goldie Hawn may have found her successor.",JGS_Doc1_LegallyBlonde,JGS,Comedy,Positive,Legally Blonde
171,JGS_Doc2_LegallyBlonde,"It's the story of a sorority girl from Bel-Air who dresses in pink, wears Prada and goes to Harvard Law School. She goes because her boyfriend is there, and she wants him back. Reese Witherspoon plays Elle Woods, the focus of this culture-clash comedy, which contrasts the values of Harvard Law with those of a Southern California rich girl. The rich girl wins, hands down. ""Legally Blonde"" is on the side of glitz, tinsel and surface, but fortunately, Witherspoon is so innately likable that the film goes along pleasantly enough. It's pleasant, yes. Funny, no. Director Robert Luketic, in his feature debut, establishes Elle as a type. He saturates the screen with hot pinks and pastels and sees to it that the sun is always shining on her. But screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith do little with the type; nor do they find ways to develop her as a character. Elle remains a one-note joke, and while the joke provides a few laughs, it loses effectiveness. This is no ""Clueless,"" despite the Southern California heroine. ""Clueless"" was, first of all, funny. It was also something of a moral journey. Watching it, we understood that its heroine needed to learn something, to grow. This contrasts starkly with ""Legally Blonde,"" whose complacent acceptance of Elle as a moral exemplar limits the screenwriters' ability to write jokes and renders the movie lightweight. Elle talks like a chipper imbecile, but the movie assures us so often that Elle is brilliant that we start to wonder if it's protesting too much, and why. Invited to a Halloween party with students who regard her as a bimbo, Elle shows up in a Playboy bunny outfit, unwittingly presenting herself as the physical embodiment of their assumptions about her. Not very smart. Humor requires that comedian and audience share common values, but the values at work in ""Legally Blonde"" -- based on the book by Amanda Brown -- are,at times, bizarre. In one scene, students talk about how they spent their summer vacation. One ""dewormed orphans"" in Somalia, and another started the organization Lesbians Against Drunk Driving. The audience is expected not only to smile at their earnestness but also to regard their idealism as phony and self-deluding, a compensation for their dullness. At the same time, we're expected to see Elle -- who got into law school with an expensively produced admissions video -- as deserving of a Harvard education and of the power and privilege that will go with it. This is where it really pays to stop thinking about ""Legally Blonde,"" the film that dares to ask the question: Can a young woman overcome the burdens of wealth, privilege and beauty in her quest for fabulous power? It really does take gall -- or is it just obliviousness? -- to make an underdog out of a girl who lives ""across the street from Aaron Spelling."" Witherspoon's sunniness makes it all palatable, or at least possible. She doesn't get to do much, but she does it onscreen for one whole movie, and she does it well. Actually, ""Legally Blonde"" benefits enormously from smart casting across the board, from the students and the bit players to the professors -- particularly Holland Taylor, a female John Houseman. Luke Wilson, as a young attorney, once again shows himself to be an appealing, low-key leading man. Likewise, newcomer Matthew Davis shines as Warner, the boyfriend who breaks Elle's heart. And Selma Blair, as Warner's girlfriend, Vivian, almost steals the movie from Witherspoon in the early going. Blair plays her role with a smoldering contempt for Elle as an upstart and a lamebrain. Vivian knows that she deserves to be at Harvard and that Elle has no business there. It's easy to understand her point of view.",JGS_Doc2_LegallyBlonde,JGS,Comedy,Positive,Legally Blonde
172,JGS_Doc3_LegallyBlonde,"""Legally Blonde"" a fluffy new fish-out-of-water, believe-in-yourself romantic comedy, includes one line that made me and some of my dyspeptic colleagues laugh giddily and helplessly. It's a throwaway bit of repartee, which I wouldn't give away even if the mildly vulgar punch line were suitable here. But then again I might, since the movie doesn't offer enough occasions for real spontaneous laughter to justify the cost of a full-price ticket. The script, written by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kristen Smith and based on a book by Amanda Brown, is the usual midlevel commercial comedy mishmash: a clear, easily digested and wildly implausible concept accessorized with hit-or-miss bits of physical and verbal humor, a fizz of light love trouble and a barrage of huggy, uplifting moments at the end. For every moment like the unquoted line, there is a piece of business like the ""bend and snap"" musical number in which the clients of a nail shop jiggle and shake, supposedly demonstrating a sure-fire way to snag a man's attention. If the laugh-inducing moments manage to outnumber the cringe-inducing ones, it's mainly because the director, Robert Luketic, hands this overstuffed Louis Vuitton suitcase of a movie to Reese Witherspoon, a sharp, quick-witted Doris Day for our drab age of screen comedy. Ms. Witherspoon plays Elle Woods, a perky sorority sister who resides in a cloud of pink fluff at Delta Nu at California University in Los Angeles. (Viewers who had no social life in the mid-90's may wonder, as I did, if this is the same C.U. that Brandon Walsh and the gang on ""Beverly Hills 90210"" attended after graduating from West Beverly High.) Elle's perfect world is shattered when her preppy boyfriend, Warner (Matthew Davis), bound for Harvard Law School, dumps her on the night she had expected him to propose. He needs a mate with more substance ""if I'm going to be a senator by the time I'm 30,"" he explains. ""I need to marry a Jackie, not a Marilyn."" Elle may be a squeaky-voiced shopaholic bombshell, but she's no dummy. Determined to travel to Cambridge to win back her undeserving man, she gains admittance to Harvard. There she discovers a student body of pale-faced grinds in dark clothes who hold her blondness and her taste in clothes against her and a faculty of imperious professors with patrician accents. But our heroine, who graduated from C.U. with a 4.0 average in fashion merchandising, turns out to have a steel-trap legal mind, lots of common sense and a good heart that draws her to a good-hearted young lawyer (Luke Wilson) and a lovelorn manicurist (Jennifer Coolidge). Really, Elle -- not to mention Ms. Witherspoon -- is smarter than the movie, which doesn't quite know what to do with her, mocking her ditzy rich-girl cluelessness at one moment and admiring her moxie the next. The character as written is incoherent, but Ms. Witherspoon has the reflexes to make Elle both appealing and ridiculous. It's funny -- in that slightly queasy, un-P.C. Doris Day kind of way -- to watch her suffer tearful humiliations, and also funny to watch her recover her dignity and tell off the snobs and hypocrites who have underestimated or maligned her. Among these are, in addition to Warner, a pompous law professor (Victor Garber) and Warner's new fianc e, a snooty Ivy League ice queen who, because she is played by the graceful, fine-boned Selma Blair, cannot be all bad. Virtue is rewarded, meanness gets its comeuppance and Elle, after a courtroom triumph too complicated and haphazardly staged to go into here, delivers the commencement address to the Harvard Law School class of 2004. ""You must always have faith in yourself,"" she concludes, surely the first time anyone has uttered such a notion in a Hollywood movie.",JGS_Doc3_LegallyBlonde,JGS,Comedy,Positive,Legally Blonde
173,JGS_Doc4_LegallyBlonde,"Although this film has a script that doesn't set it apart from its predecessors like Clueless, it thankfully has the radiant presence of Reese Witherspoon to hold the film up. Legally Blonde has all the usual elements of a teenie-bopper flick and reese's performance is comparable to Alicia Silverstone in Clueless or Larisa Oleynik in 10 Things I Hate About You (which, interestingly, have the same writers). But Reese's performance has something more. She's really the film's ""tent-pole"" in that without her performance, the film would just be another teen flick like Road Trip or (heaven forbid!) Can't Hardly Wait. Here's the basic plot: when a blonde sorority queen is dumped by her boyfriend, she decides to follow him to law school to get him back and, once there, learns she has more legal savvy than she ever imagined. (taken from the IMDB) What's fun about this movie though is that it tries to go beyond the traditional teen flick with its location and selection of characters. It's like the filmmakers took a teen movie to college and tried to dress it up a little. Of course, that doesn't mean that all the other elements of the film did not come from a cookie cutter formula. You've got the cute star that's in trouble, and needs to use the ingenuity she never knew she had to get out of her predicament (Reese Witherspoon). You've got the dreamy boyfriend who isn't all he's cracked up to be (named ""Warner,"" played by Matthew Davis), the guy the heroine really should be after (""Emmett"" played by Luke Wilson), and the jealous girlfriend (""Vivian"" played by Selma Blair) . . . each element necessary for a teen flick. But even though I knew I'd seen this situation before (teen girl must get teen guy back), the fun approach taken to the whole ""blonde and dumb"" idea made me not care that the film was pretty shallow in spots and mostly filled with fluff. Because that fluff was fun. And Legally Blonde doesn't apologize for it's fluff. It revels in it. There's nothing worse than a teen flick that tries to take itself too seriously while trying to keep in the whole ""teens are funny so we must put them in movies"" idea. (like the worst movie of 1998: Can't Hardly Wait) This film's refusal to verge into the There's Something About Mary (i.e.: stupid comedy) was a plus as well. The film quite possibly could have gone off the deep end with the kind of humor only 5 year old boys laugh at, but it tries to stay away from that, presenting the audience with, instead, a fun time at the movies. And that's really what's kind of appealing about this film. You can see it and not expect to get a heavy-handed dose about some moralistic nonsense that the director feels you need to learn. And you don't get bored with juvenile humor and toilet gags like in an Eddie Murphy film. It's just a feel good movie with a kind message and a fun delivery. The message, by the way is ""be yourself."" Of course, if you think about it too much, it starts feeling like an ABC after-school special. Remember those ""when teens are in trouble: the lame story"" flicks that were lame even when you were the right age to watch them. Like 10 years old? Legally Blonde gives you a wee dose of ""you can do it"" without drowning you in the message. That's not to say the message isn't pretty clear. And in one of my only criticisms on the film, I would have to say that the ending went on just a little bit too long. Right before the credits, when all the students are graduating, the camera takes several shots of the main characters in the movie and puts a few words up on the screen about the outcome for that character. And this is fine. But after you get four or five of these little post-scripts, the film goes on for about another 30 seconds showing the audience a bunch of shots of the students, the faculty, and Reese. It's like the movie was stretched just a few minutes too long. That's not to say that the scene shouldn't be in the movie, it is after all, the ending, but there's just so much the audience needs of all the characters smiling blissfully in their success (or failure, as with the boyfriend). But all in all, this is a small complaint. In my only other complaint on the film, I'd have to say that even with the film's ability to look seriousness in the face and laugh at it, I felt that sometimes the humor was sometimes one-dimensional and not unique enough to set the film apart from other cookie-cutter flicks. The film almost denies itself that fun attitude by trying to be two things at once: a movie that's more than a teen flick, but also a movie that's an exact replica of a teen flick. Most of this paradox is on the back burner for me though, because I was just heartily impressed with Reese Witherspoon's performance. She plays a very endearing character whose attempts to help the people around her make her infinitely likeable. And the ensemble cast that joins her also gives the film a warm and fuzzy feeling. Which is all I really expected from the flick. In an interesting marketing ploy, the advertisers for this film partnered with a major hair salon chain to give out free blonde dye jobs about a week before the movie came out. This is a clear example that the filmmakers actually celebrate the art of being a blonde, rather than insulting it, like in most films. This was a fun change. Even though I'm not blonde, I still think it was a fun way of looking at the whole blonde stereotype. This film is definitely a fun time at the movies and is the flick to see if you want to take a break from the daily grind, but don't want to be inundated with fart jokes.",JGS_Doc4_LegallyBlonde,JGS,Comedy,Positive,Legally Blonde
174,JGS_Doc5_LegallyBlonde,"Ohmygod, you guys. I saw the BEST movie the other day. It was a-DOR-able. It's called ""Legally Blonde,"" and it's about this blonde sorority girl who becomes a lawyer and saves the day. (Of course. How could she not?) The movie is a lot like 1995's ""Clueless,"" which was also totally cute, in that it has a brain and a heart. And like its heroine, it's a lot smarter than it looks. Hopefully, it'll do more for Reese Witherspoon's career than ""Clueless"" did for Alicia Silverstone's. (Hull-o? Anyone remember ""Excess Baggage""?) Witherspoon plays the fabulously dressed and perfectly coifed Elle Woods: president of the Delta Nu sorority, Miss June in the campus calendar, AND she has a 4.0 grade point average. OK, so her major is, like, fashion merchandising. The girl is an expert on varying shades of pink. Elle thinks her gorgeous boyfriend, Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis), is going to pop the question over a special dinner, but he dumps her instead, telling her that his dreams of being a politician demand that he have a more substantial mate - whatever THAT means. ""If I'm going to be a senator by the time I'm 30, I need to stop (messing) around,"" Warner tells Elle as she cries in her champagne. One day at the salon, she gets the BEST idea - she'll show Warner she can be all serious and stuff by following him to Harvard Law School! She studies super hard for the law school entrance exam, which her best friends (Jessica Cauffiel and Alanna Ubach) TOTALLY don't understand. And the video she makes to go with her application is hys-TER-ical. She had a Coppola direct it, and she appears dressed in an array of sequined bikinis, spouting legal terms as well as the latest ""Days of Our Lives"" developments. Her dad doesn't see the point. ""Law school is for people who are boring and ugly and serious, and you, button, are none of those things,"" he tells her, an ever-present martini in hand. But she gets in! She totally doesn't fit in at first, especially toting her a-DOR-able Chihuahua everywhere she goes, dressed in a matching outfit. And she's nothing like those uptight East Coast students - especially Vivian Kensington (Selma Blair, who co-starred with Witherspoon in the 1999 guilty pleasure ""Cruel Intentions"") that horrible blue-blooded snob Warner is dating. But her keen intuition, unbeatable enthusiasm and impeccable sense of style see her through. She even helps out on a murder trial. How cool is THAT? (OK, so the movie does drag a bit here, but you can't have everything, you know?) Witherspoon showed in 1999's ""Election"" how complete she can make a character, how she can turn somebody annoying into a sympathetic figure you want to cheer for. Elle isn't nearly as obnoxious as overachieving Tracy Flick in ""Election,"" but she is interminably perky, which would be hard to tolerate on anyone else. Witherspoon appears in nearly every frame of the movie, and she positively sparkles. ""Legally Blonde"" is the feature film debut of director Robert Luketic, and he did SUCH an awesome job! Screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz (a blond former sorority girl who took fashion merchandising classes) and Kirsten Smith give her great things to say, and they inject so many cute details. Her resume is pink - and scented. ""I think it gives it a little something extra,"" she explains to a law professor, smiling. And when she picks up the cordless phone, it's covered in fluffy pink fur. As a young lawyer working with Elle, Luke Wilson doesn't get to do much but play the straight man, which is too bad because he was so good in ""Bottle Rocket"" and in small roles in ""Rushmore"" and ""My Dog Skip."" Jennifer Coolidge, though, is way better here as a frumpy, insecure manicurist than in recent roles in ""Pootie Tang"" and ""Down to Earth"" - maybe because she has better material to work with, DUH. You don't have to have a law degree to figure THAT out.",JGS_Doc5_LegallyBlonde,JGS,Comedy,Positive,Legally Blonde
175,JGS_Doc6_LegallyBlonde,"Back in her early teens, Reese Witherspoon proved herself a terrific actress in her big-screen debut, Man in the Moon, in 1991. Since then, she's done first-rate work in critical hits like Pleasantville, cult faves like Freeway and Election and underrated gems like Best Laid Plans. So how is it she now finds herself stuck in a tepid, by-the-numbers vehicle like Legally Blonde? Let's start with the title: Legally Blonde is yet another pun based on the similarity between blonde and blind, in the grand tradition of Blond Ambition and Blonde Fury. Yet, while unoriginal, it manages to add a soup on of distastefulness to this well-worn gag by being the first to riff on a phrase referring to actual sightlessness. We do not slouch from bad taste...if it's at least in the service of something really, really clever. (Springtime for Hitler leaps to mind.) But in this case, sad to say, the title is a good sampling of the wit level of the film as a whole. Witherspoon plays Elle Woods, a spoiled, brain-dead sorority bimbo from the Delta Nu chapter at ""CULA."" (The portrayal of this thinly disguised Southern California campus' student body should be grounds for a class-action suit on behalf of the hardworking kids over in Westwood.) Elle thinks her boyfriend, Warner (Matthew Davis of Tigerland and Pearl Harbor), is about to pop the big question before heading off to Harvard Law School, but she's living in a fool's paradise. Instead, Warner breaks up with her, explaining that while he loves her, she just wouldn't be an acceptable wife for the East Coast establishment lifestyle his parents have chosen for him. (His brother has just gotten engaged to a Vanderbilt, a match that in the film's view must obviously be loveless, since, gosh, Ms. Vanderbilt has committed the horrible sin of being homely.) But Elle, like countless other lovelorn airheads before her, has pluck (and apparently limitless money and unbelievable luck), so she decides to get into Harvard Law herself and show that snooty ol' Warner that she can be everything he's looking for. Clearly this is not high realism we're dealing with, as Elle proceeds to do everything so totally wrong in the application process that the admissions committee is inexplicably impressed and lets her in on the grounds of ""diversity."" (Let us briefly pause to consider the fact that Elle seems to be applying at the end of her senior year in order to start school that fall. They could have at least attempted some lame explanation for that.) Next thing ya know, there's Elle and Warner both as first-year students at Harvard Law, where our heroine quickly embarrasses herself by dressing and acting exactly like the absurd ditz that she is. You'd think that someone who was an honors graduate of CULA's Fashion Marketing B.A. program might know that heels and flouncy pink outfits are not really de rigueur on Ivy League campuses, but not our Elle. All of which gives lots of ammunition to Warner's spiteful, snobby new fianc e, Vivian (Selma Blair, who also appeared with Witherspoon in Cruel Intentions). You know where this is heading. Through a remarkable series of coincidences, Elle finds herself working as an intern in the defense of an accused murderer, whom she just happens to know and whom, being her cultural twin, she can relate to better than any of the other lawyers can. And eventually, somehow, the specialized knowledge she has about fashion, makeup and hair care will end up saving the day. The final big courtroom scene demands comparison to the climax of My Cousin Vinny, another moron-shows-that-book-knowledge-isn't-everything legal epic. Vinny was not a great film, but Marisa Tomei's big revelation testimony was a genuinely exciting, invigorating, funny scene. The equivalent sequence in Legally Blonde has almost no impact: It isn't set up as well, and it flies by so fast that it makes the abrupt final confrontations in the Perry Mason TV show seem positively leisurely. (There is also the weird notion that one male character's having a boyfriend makes it impossible that he might also have a female lover. In the world of Legally Blonde, bisexuality doesn't exist.) Making his feature debut, director Robert Luketic is never able to overcome the basic flaws that underlie the entire concept. That is, in the manner of Mike Nichols' Working Girl -- which was surely the model for this -- Elle is supposed to be an essentially good soul without a trace of snobbery, who is smarter under the surface than she has ever cared to find out. But unlike Melanie Griffith's Tess, who was being held back by her economic background, Elle is a rich kid who has been held back by her own loathsome choices, someone whose actions early on do betray dismissive, superior attitudes based on the shallowest of criteria. Witherspoon is an inherently likable enough presence to nearly pull this off. (That likability is why she can get away with playing characters we should hate, like the violent, foulmouthed girl in Freeway.) But the muddiness of the basic concept and the thinness of its execution eventually defeat even her talents.",JGS_Doc6_LegallyBlonde,JGS,Comedy,Negative,Legally Blonde
176,JGS_Doc7_LegallyBlonde,"Legally Blonde is, of course, a pun on ""legally blind,"" and that's a pretty good place to start in assessing this movie, which seems to perceive its lead character as, at best, a wispy blur. Sometimes it doesn't see her at all, even though she's right there in front of us, in stiletto pumps and wide pink lapels. Watching the movie got me thinking about another old phrase, ""vanity project,"" which usually described a play or film so obviously centered around a single performance that the star's desire for attention was the project's sole raison d' tre: think Billy Crystal in Mr. Saturday Night, Jodie Foster in Nell, or Bette Midler in For the Boys. Legally Blonde, if it had more presumptions to substance, might be called a ""vanity project"" for star Reese Witherspoon, and yet the term would have to be ironic, because the character of Elle Woods is both its reason for being and its central flaw. No one knows who she is. One person Elle isn't, try as everyone may, is Cher Horowitz, the insouciant, deceptively sharp Valley Girl brought so vividly to life by Amy Heckerling and Alicia Silverstone in Clueless. Cher is such a distinct, well-drawn character that she almost topples the rest of Clueless, particularly toward the end, when it becomes evident that the other characters and indeed the entire scenario aren't nearly as specific or as fully alive as she is. Would that Legally Blonde had that problem. Here is how far the newer movie gets, hoping lightning will strike twice: Reese-As-Elle duplicates Cher's big saucer eyes, her insolent, lippy pout, her fondness for improbably furry phones and other way-stylized accessories. She lives in Cher's neck of the woods, as a sorority president at fictional C.U.L.A., she's all over the tropical-colored ensembles, and she's got a cute, upwardly mobile boyfriend. Well, Cher never actually dated anyone like Warner (Matthew Davis), a smarmy graduating senior who's headed to Harvard Law. And, for that matter, Reese-as-Elle doesn't have him for long either. The movie's first sequence, which promises more fun than it ever afterward delivers, finds Elle primping for what she thinks is a wedding proposal date, only to find herself dumped and mascara-streaked, walking home from a high-powered restaurant. ""Get in the car,"" Warner pleads, as Reese-as-Elle dejectedly drags herself home, though she proudly refuses, citing her need to separate herself, her integrity, etc. ""You'll ruin your shoes,"" he reminds her. She hops in. It is not clear if Elle is superficial, or if we are to take her as refreshingly, unneurotically honest about taking care of things she likes, such as her shoes. Certainly the rest of the movie doesn't clear this up. And yes, I can hear you bristling, and yes, I realize that Legally Blonde is not a movie aiming for psychological realism. I do not expect that Reese Witherspoon ""inhabit"" this character, or that she do sense memory exercises and know what Elle would have for breakfast, or what her greatest fear might be. However: the rest of the movie follows Reese-as-Elle to Harvard, where she is determined to prove herself worthy of Warner's love. (He has dumped her because he feels she will not be an asset in impressing voters during future political campaigns.) The fact that Elle scores triumphantly on the LSATs implies that she actually is smart, and that Warner underestimates her. The fact that she sends the Harvard admissions committee a tape of herself in a bikini, sweet-talking them from a whirlpool, suggests that her virtues lie elsewhere than her intellect, even though it's clear throughout that she's a perfectly nice girl who is certainly overqualified for the smug Warner. Then she gets to Harvard and says nothing but stupid things. Then a professor, played by Victor Garber (who wished he'd built Rose a better ship in Titanic), sees an intellectual spark in Elle that he doesn't see in others, so maybe she's a brain after all; he hires her as an intern. Then, she spends most of the time in their board meetings talking about Delta Nu social history. Back and forth, back and forth, the movie wobbles among three perspectives about Elle: that she is way smarter than anyone thinks, and they don't notice because they are superficial; that she is not a genius but has sincerity and common sense, which are better than intelligence; and that she lacks both an IQ and a basic understanding of human behavior and communication, but that's okay, because it's just important that people be nice. In other words, she is either Alicia Silverstone in Clueless, Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, or Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, albeit with better hair. These are not difficult choices: any of these characterizations is fairly easy to accomplish, and once established, any number of enjoyable movies has taken off from their foundations. But Legally Blonde just can't make up its mind; in fact, it doesn't seem aware that it's obligated to have a mind about anything. First-time director Robert Luketic almost seems to enjoy tinkering with a pattern that was never broken, making all of the contrary decisions that can turn what is essentially cut-and-dried into a movie that has to scramble to stay coherent. A subplot about sexual propositioning gets thrown in with the same ""Why not?"" aplomb as a sudden choreographed routine led by Reese-as-Elle inside her favorite manicure salon (sort of like when all those women started dancing to Holly Hunter's lead in Living Out Loud). The one character who is nice to Elle in her New England environs, a manicurist named Paulette and played by Best in Show's riotous Jennifer Coolidge, is cruelly lit and costumed to look as shopworn as possible. By contrast, the one character to which the film allows itself to be utterly unsympathetic Warner's new fianc e, Vivian (Selma Blair) is incongruously allowed a change of heart, because really, it's not fair to make a character despicable just because she's brunette and wears headbands. Vivian's benighted brunetteness is just the first of many sad gusts that air-bubble movies like Legally Blonde eventually start coasting along to their irrelevant finish. Others include: 1) People with foreign accents are funny, as are gays; 2) If you think brunette is bad, having curly brunette hair is way worse; and, 3) Just when you've learned the lesson that a girl shouldn't have to define herself against some dumb man, we are assured in an inevitable final scene that she may now safely define herself against some kind-of-nice man. Jesus, people. If John Waters had been around to direct this thing, it might have had a shot. As is, the film wants to be both John Hughes and John Waters, failing to understand that the twain shall never meet. What saves Legally Blonde and makes it disappointingly mediocre instead of annoyingly coy and offensive is that Reese-as-Elle whom, by the way, Reese brings off with some charm is not required to Learn a Very Valuable Lesson, nor is Legally Blonde at any point suggestive that it is secretly a Very Important Film. It lacks that ounce of pretension, to quote Dolly Parton in Steel Magnolias, that can make a real pound of manure: for negative comparison from this year alone, see the so-sure-it's-hip The Mexican or the so-sure-it's-progressive The Brothers. Legally Blonde may not know what it's doing half the time, but it at least seems reconciled to its own silliness. And it does contain one fantastic retort, which I don't mind reproducing, because then you don't have to see the movie: when Elle, through massive cyclones of legalese, wins back Paulette's dog from her estranged husband, the young lawyer chirps, ""He's still scratching his head!"", to which Paulette answers, ""Yeah, must be a nice vacation for his balls."" Or maybe you had to be there. In any case, it pales by comparison to the best retort I heard about the movie. When Elle, victorious (surprise!), exits through the courtroom doors, and Luketic grandiosely dissolves her into a blinding field of white light, my friend Amanda sharply inquired, ""Did she just die?"" In one respect, at least, I hope she did, since I doubt the world is ready for Legally Blonder. Unless John Waters isn't busy.",JGS_Doc7_LegallyBlonde,JGS,Comedy,Negative,Legally Blonde

Her utopian microcosm is shattered when her dimpled frat boy love interest Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis) dumps her on the very night she thinks he is going to propose. As it turns out, Warner, who is leaving to study law at Harvard University, wants to marry someone a little brainier who will help bolster his image when he runs for public office. So Elle decides to apply to Harvard Law School and groom herself to become a career politician's wife in hopes of winning him back. She sends HLS a video essay and, clad in a pink bikini floating in her pool on an air mattress, details the reasons why they should consider her application. For whatever ludicrous reason, this works, and Elle packs her bags and pet Chihuahua and heads for the Cambridge dorms. But rather than win her popularity, her high maintenance looks ostracize her from Harvard's academic overachievers. And just when things could not get any worse, she finds out Warner has reunited with his prep school sweetie Vivian (Selma Blair). Articulate and magnetic, Witherspoon salvages this film from its painfully wafer thin and predictable plot. She makes shoddy dialogue entertaining and lame one-liners seem sharp. She also adds some dimension to her bimbo character Elle, demonstrating both her smart and flaky side. Unfortunately, the script calls for her SoCal ditzy persona to prevail over the one with substance. Her dark-haired nemesis Blair perfectly acts the part of Warner's bitchy, blue-blooded girlfriend. She turns her stiff, pearl-clad character into a more likable and distinctive one. These two rivals definitely steal the show. Too bad the same cannot be said for Davis, who gives a bland and forgettable performance as Elle's boyfriend Warner. Of course it doesn't help that the script left him with no redeemable qualities whatsoever. Jennifer Coolidge is funny enough as the tacky manicurist who befriends Elle, but why on earth were Jessica Cauffiel and Alanna Ubach cast as her sorority sidekicks? They look more like 30-year-old beauty school dropouts than a couple of college students. As talented as Witherspoon is, her abilities can only detract so much from such an ill-conceived story line where things never seem to add up. In an early scene, for example, Elle is in her dorm room applying nail polish, a hair-color kit from Herbal Essences clearly visible on her desk. It's hard to believe the girl who grew up across the street from Aaron Spelling would color her hair over the bathroom sink and actually paint her own nails. The props and costumes are elaborate and pink, giving the film a campy, bubble-gum feel, but it's presented inconsistently. The ending comes together a little too easily when Elle solves a high profile case thanks to her in-depth knowledge of hair perms. To make things cheerier, the characters' futures are summed up at the bottom of the screen. Not surprisingly, the heroes succeed and the villains get their just desserts. Elle, who spend most of the film lamenting the hardships of being a blonde and beautiful object, learns that she really can get by just by being perky!

But you can't say the same thing about its star, Reese Witherspoon: Her sophisticated-pixie brilliance practically makes the movie, and her easy, confident, curvaceous carriage doesn't hurt, either -- she's the thinking guy's cupcake, maybe because her mind is just as supple as her curves. When, as Beverly Hills-bred sorority girl Elle Woods, she shows up for her first day at Harvard Law School in a trim-fitting ensemble of pink pearlized leather, the only appropriate response is a heart-shaped sigh. If it's possible to play the essence of a perfume cloud -- an '80s classic like Yves St. Laurent's ""Opium,"" let's say -- Witherspoon does it in ""Legally Blonde."" When we first meet Reese's blond glamour-cutie Elle Woods it's the end of her senior year in college, and she's eagerly awaiting the ring and marriage proposal that she's sure her handsome, dull boyfriend Warner (Matthew Davis) is about to deliver. He doesn't come through: He's on his way to law school, and he's hoping for a career in politics. ""If I'm going to be a senator, I need to marry a Jackie, not a Marilyn,"" he explains matter-of-factly, delivering the line more to Elle's plunging neckline than to her face. First heartbroken, then determined, Elle decides that the best way to get Warner back is to get into law school herself. She has a 4.0 grade point average -- so what if it's in fashion merchandising? She puts on a sequined bikini for her admissions video, and somehow the old codgers at Harvard decide she might just be a complementary addition to their hallowed halls. When she arrives on campus, though, she realizes that no one takes her seriously because of the way she looks, least of all the haughty brunet prep Vivian Kensington (played by the marvelous Selma Blair), who, much to Elle's horror, has stolen Warner away over the summer. That means war: Elle sets out to prove her snooty classmates wrong and get her boyfriend back. The opening scenes of ""Legally Blonde"" (directed by Robert Luketic, making his feature debut) vibrate with a bubble-gum pink glow, and their cartoonishness is exhilarating. We see Elle in her sorority house, surrounded by a gaggle of giggling sisters, getting ready for her big date with Warner: None of these women are exactly rocket scientists, but Luketic doesn't hurl cheap jokes at them so much as bounce gags off them with a gentle ping. When it comes to humor, Luketic has a nice touch. He knows how to frame individual jokes so they're like little jewels. There's one particularly brilliant one-liner delivered by the always-funny Jennifer Coolidge (perhaps best remembered as Stiffler's mom in ""American Pie"") as Paulette, a friend the depressed Elle makes at a beauty parlor far outside the tweedy, upper-crusty confines of Harvard Square. I won't give it away here, but Coolidge delivers the joke with such offhanded insouciance that it seems to take a quick whirl around the movie theater before it swings back to zonk you. It's like a trick bullet, and it's killer. The movie ambles along amiably enough, and there's a heartbeat of intelligence pulsing beneath Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith's script (adapted from a novel by Amanda Brown). ""Legally Blonde"" shows a fair amount of perceptiveness about class issues. Even though Elle has as much money as her Harvard classmates (or more), with her love for flashy, ultrafashionable outfits and candy-colored manicures, she fits in better with the working-class girls she meets at the beauty parlor. And the movie isn't afraid to send up the drabness of Ivy League academia -- that of Harvard, in particular. Anybody who's ever spent 30 minutes in Cambridge's Harvard Square will instantly recognize the ""I'm smart and possibly very rich, but I'm still going to wear this pilly poncho around campus as a symbol of my earnestness and rejection of bourgeois values"" look of the students in ""Legally Blonde."" They're cartoons, of course, just as Elle is a cartoon, but that's what makes ""Legally Blonde"" fun. The bad news is, the movie starts heading nowhere after the first half-hour, and careers and flounders badly until it gets there. Too many superb actors -- in particular, Holland Taylor, as a tough-nuts Harvard professor, and Victor Garber, as the professor who first picks up on glimmers of Elle's intelligence -- are wasted. There are numerous subthreads in the story that are simply left hanging, undeveloped. And Luke Wilson, so unassumingly funny in ""Home Fries"" and ""Charlie's Angels,"" supposedly plays Elle's love interest here, but we don't get to see the romance unfold. But even after it becomes clear that ""Legally Blonde"" is headed nowhere fast, there's always Witherspoon and her winsome Chihuahua Bruiser. The two are inseparable, and even wear matching Tiffany heart necklaces. Witherspoon, with that acorn-shaped Kewpie doll face, has always been a charmer. But the real key to her appeal is that inside, she's tough as old boots, and here, as well as in pictures like ""Freeway"" and ""Election,"" she's not afraid to show it. Witherspoon plays Elle with a squinty determination that's both devilishly funny and endearing. She delineates Elle's character beautifully just in the way she takes notes on her first day of class: Eyes round and alert, mouth set in a hard hyphen of concentration, she occasionally turns her attention to her heart-shaped note pad, where she scribbles away with a fluffy pink feather pen. Witherspoon telegraphs Elle's sense of justice and outrage with just enough of a broad twang: ""Whoever said orange was the 'new pink' was seriously disturbed."" If Witherspoon could be summed up as a color, she'd be the new pink. I doubt she'll ever be anything as garish and unbecoming as orange.",JGS_Doc9_LegallyBlonde,JGS,Comedy,Negative,Legally Blonde
179,JGS_Doc10_LegallyBlonde,"In another era, this film would have been called  Tammy Goes to Law School,  and the role of Elle Woods, well-played here by Reese Witherspoon, would certainly have gone to Debbie Reynolds or Sandra Dee. For this is a mild, somewhat sugary romantic comedy about a young woman with a perky personality who chases the man of her dreams to Harvard Law School only to discover she prefers the law to her knucklehead ex-boyfriend. Predictable, cutesy and surprisingly short on genuine humor, Legally Blonde gets by thanks to the magnetic presence of Witherspoon. The MGM pic should open well, but whether this Blonde has the shapely legs to sustain a long theatrical run in the heat of summer is doubtful. The film could have a modest success in video and cable markets. The perfunctory, implausible setup has Elle, a postfeminist girl with only marriage on her mind after graduation from a Los Angeles university, jilted by longtime beau Warner Harrington III (Matthew Davis). Determined to get elected to the U.S. Senate by age 30, this rich kid on his way to Harvard Law School can t afford the burden of a blond airhead for a wife. Only Elle, while blond, is no airhead. The movie swiftly establishes her as a smart woman but one whose priorities place clothing and nail and hair design far above, say, education or world events. (When a classmate claims to have spent the last two years in Bosnia, Elle remarks that that would explain her hairdo.) Against all logic, Elle immediately gets accepted into Harvard Law School, too   boy, that was easy. This sets up a cultural clash as Elle s signature pink   worn by her and her Chihuahua, Moonie   fails to jibe with the navy-blue blazer world of law school. Clothing certainly means everything in this movie as the filmmakers display a strong bias for blue-collar duds and exuberant flash over upper-class sartorial conservatism. Eager to get the movie out of classrooms and libraries, the second half plunges into an absurd storyline that has these first-year law students ditch their books to help a professor defend a woman charged with murder. Young Australian filmmaker Robert Luketic, directing his first feature and perhaps a little out of his depth, plays much of the comedy too broadly. But this undoubtedly springs from desperation as Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith s screenplay lacks any real humor. In Sandra Dee s time, Hollywood could portray innocence with a charming straightforwardness. Nowadays, the strain shows. Unwilling to give their heroine the bad habits and social faux pas of the titular character in Bridget Jones s Diary   to which this movie bears a passing resemblance   the filmmakers are baffled how to wring humor out of Elle s milk-and-cookies personality. Instead they take tepid potshots at characters  social attitudes, preppy snobbery, spineless behavior and male chauvinism. Several actors do register despite the superficial characterizations in the writing. Selma Blair has a strong presence as Elle s rival for Warner s affections, coming on as a bitch initially, then softening into feminine solidarity with the heroine. Luke Wilson makes an easygoing love interest for Elle, while Victor Garber and Holland Taylor command their classrooms as law professors. Jennifer Coolidge has her moments in the cliche of a  blousy  beautician desperate for male companionship. Technical credits are pro, especially in costume and set design. It would appear, though, that virtually none of the movie, other than a few overhead shots, was filmed anywhere near Harvard s campus.",JGS_Doc10_LegallyBlonde,JGS,Comedy,Negative,Legally Blonde
50,CYQ_Doc1_PitchBlack,"If you ever wondered what it might feel like to be inside a spaceship cracking apart during a violent crash landing, Pitch Black gives you the experience bright and early. The camera jiggles around spasmodically, the actors shout unintelligible gibberish at each other, the sound hammers us. Unfortunately, this describes too much of the rest of the movie, too, without a crash landing as an excuse. Pitch Black is yet another insecure hissy fit of a movie   a thriller without enough confidence in itself or its characters to calm down for two seconds and let the actors speak to each other like human beings. Movies like this copy the who-goes-there thrills of Alien and John Carpenter s The Thing without those films  grubby, everyday, human-scaled group dynamics. Here, the spaceship in question is carrying a motley crew mostly headed for someplace called  New Mecca ; in addition to the expected Muslims (led by Keith David, of The Thing), there s a geologist, an antiques collector, a morphine-addicted cop, a teenage boy who s not what he seems, and a serial killer. This all smacks of gimmickry   these aren t people, they re conflict units. In Alien and The Thing, the people confined together were allowed personalities which could then flare up. The only people in Pitch Black with anything resembling a personality are the serial killer, Riddick (Vin Diesel), and the ship s pilot, Fry (Radha Mitchell), whose soft features juxtapose nicely with her tough nature. Mostly, the people wander around on the parched, godforsaken rock they ve landed on, squabbling over how to escape, while gradually being picked off by slithering monsters who thrive on darkness. Of course, this planet has three suns and thus no darkness, but wouldn t you just know a total eclipse happens to be approaching? Pitch Black does have an imaginative look. Whenever the characters step outside into the alien air, cinematographer David Eggby (Mad Max) bleaches out everything, which makes sense: These are alien suns whose light is passing through an alien atmosphere, so of course things will look different. And I liked how Riddick, whose eyes have been doctored to allow him to see in the dark, emerges as the unlikely hero who alone can see the ravenous monsters. The Riddick s-eye view of the beasts is a neat touch of psychedelia. Problem is, you may wish you could see through Riddick s eyes all the time. Pitch Black, like so many other horror movies in recent years, is too often so dimly lit that you can t tell what s going on. Yes, the latter half unfolds during an eclipse, but a film can be dark and still be visible (perfect example: Carpenter s Halloween). The expensive, computer-generated creatures lurk around in the dark, revealed to us only in teasing flashes   perhaps for the best, considering that what we do see looks heavily indebted to H.R. Giger s Alien/Species designs. And the editing, as usual, is far too jangled; if you don t like a shot, wait two seconds and it ll change. I always chuckle at these movies, because the characters are just food delivery; you wonder what the creatures would do for sustenance without the occasional crash landing. (Here, they cannibalize each other too.) How about an alien movie where human flesh turns out to be poisonous to aliens? Then the conflict would be about who in the group should sacrifice himself so that the aliens could eat him, get poisoned, and die. The movie would be short, but at least it d be different.",CYQ_Doc1_PitchBlack,CYQ,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch Black
51,CYQ_Doc2_PitchBlack,"Practitioner of guilty pleasure B-movies such as 1996 s underrated alien invasion yarn The Arrival director David Twohy made Pitch Black in 2000, and it has since earned a cult following. The last film produced by PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, the production was completed for $23 million, and it more than doubled its returns at the worldwide box office. Its modest performance nonetheless announced the arrival of Vin Diesel s action hero stardom; before this and Boiler Room (released on the same day as Pitch Black), Diesel s notable credits consisted of only a small supporting role in Steven Spielberg s Saving Private Ryan (1998) and voicework on Brad Bird s animated gem The Iron Giant (1999). Twohy s movie didn t make Diesel a household name, but it s something both he and his fans have returned to over the years. Many discovered Pitch Black on home video, while Diesel later teamed with Twohy to continue the adventures of the movie s anti-hero, Riddick. Jim and Ken Wheat wrote the screenplay along with Twohy, and the result derives influence from every notable sci-fi classic of the last fifty years. The movie opens with a spacecraft moving steadily through the blackness of space, recalling those iconic shots from Kubrick s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and later Star Wars (1977). Space debris penetrates the hull, and the craft begins to descend into the atmosphere of a nearby planet. With the captain killed in the chaos, pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) considers jettisoning some forty passengers in cryo-sleep so she might survive. She doesn t, and in the ensuing crash, less than a dozen make it. Among the survivors are the Muslim Imam (Keith David), the would-be cop Johns (Cole Hauser), a boy named Jack (Rhiana Griffith), the antiquities dealer Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald), and a detained killer named Richard B. Riddick (Diesel). Stranded on a desert planet that has three suns and perpetual sunlight, the survivors pool their resources and head out into the surrounding nothingness to search for water. But the search becomes secondary after the escape of Riddick, a killer whose murderous ways are confirmed by Johns and never denied in Riddick s monosyllabic retorts. Still, we know he s the hero because he s the one narrating. He s eventually caught after one of the survivors mysteriously dies, although he insists he s not responsible.  All you people are so scared of me.  Diesel s character rumbles.  Most days, I d take that as a compliment. But it ain t me you gotta worry about now.  Indeed, traveling with Riddick as their captive, they come upon a leftover science camp in which they find no signs of human life but they do find large, carnivorous, nocturnal batlike creatures that remain hidden in a web of underground tunnels. Worse, as the camp s former geologists learned, they re about to witness a planetary eclipse that only occurs every 22 years and lasts nearly a month, meaning the dark-dwelling creatures can finally emerge from their slumber to feed. This nonsensical but otherwise intriguing idea comes with plenty of scientific questions, such as how do these creatures survive a 22-year hibernation period? In his review, Roger Ebert questions how such constant volcanic warmth from three suns would allow animals to survive on the planet at all. These questions are unavoidable but pointless for the material, as the setup is primarily a thorny series of potboiler circumstances designed to give the characters something to argue about. And what works best about Pitch Black are the characters they re actually interesting, or at least the actors are. The always reliable Mitchell was little-known in 2000, this being the first of her many B-movie appearances from Silent Hill to Rogue. Hauser swaggers in his brash arrogance, his villainous bounty hunter almost as hateful as his high-school bully roles from School Ties and Dazed and Confused. David is always solid in a genre movie supporter (see John Carpenter s The Thing or They Live), and Griffith s character comes with an unexpected surprise. Pitch Black isn t just a battle between baddies: Riddick vs. Aliens. Twohy and the Wheats make clear nods to Alien as their characters relate to one another while vile monsters take them down one-by-one. Mitchell s character arc is a less compelling version of Sigourney Weaver s Ripley; she s a conflicted and involving character we care about. Still, this is Diesel s show. Following other nihilistic anti-heroes such as Escape from New York s Snake Plissken, the muscle-bound Riddick is always smarter, tougher, and badassier that anyone else onscreen. Of course, his larger-than-life character isn t as evil as Johns suggests; instead, he s the kind of incorrigible anti-hero who only exists in comic books and post-apocalyptic fiction. This human-franchise-in-the-making comes equipped with blades and goggles to protect his see-in-the-dark eyes a feature Riddick opted for after his sentence in an underground prison, and which comes in handy once the eclipse beckons hordes of hissing creatures. Even the boy Jack thinks Riddick is immediately cool and, charmingly, adopts Riddick s trademarked goggles and tough guy attitude for the remainder of the movie. But no matter how many better movies Pitch Black borrows from, this entertaining little sci-fi/horror exercise is just good enough to keep its audience diverted for its runtime. Twohy has some impressive visuals in his bag, especially after the lights go out and the humans begin scrambling for a light source. Lame are the grayed alien POV images and Riddick s purple night vision shots, both perspectives rendered using cheap-looking CGI. The alien creatures also look silly, the special FX having dated badly since the movie s release. But then, this isn t a movie about spatial science, aliens, or even the ever-increasing body count. Pitch Black is about how Twohy makes stereotypical characters come alive, in part because of his effective casting, and in part because he takes his time setting up the effective thrills. Another filmmaker wouldn t have waited an hour to shut off the lights and start the killing. Twohy bides his time, develops his cast, and then unleashes hell upon them. Brainless though it may be, it s the kind of guilty pleasure at which Twohy specializes.",CYQ_Doc2_PitchBlack,CYQ,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pitch Black
52,CYQ_Doc3_PitchBlack,"Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel) can t seem to remain unconscious in cryosleep like the other 40 or more civilians and officers resting stationarily in their chambers aboard a space transport. He s the only prisoner of the group, which prompts him to contemplate the many opportunities for escape that may present themselves over the course of the 41-week journey. When a meteor shower causes excessive damage, causing the crew to be automatically awoken prematurely, Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) inherits a command position after learning that Captain Tom Mitchell has perished. And then a tumultuous crash-landing plunges them all into darkness. With the back half of the ship torn away, it s obvious that the desert planet (boasting three suns) on which they stumbled will be their new home for some time. William Johns (Cole Hauser) is in charge of Riddick, who poses a conundrum, as he d previously broken out of a maximum-security prison. Blindfolded and gagged, Riddick is additionally chained to a beam; but it s not enough to hold the man forever. A handful of survivors scour the wreckage, gather usable supplies, and hope to locate water   but they have more pressing things to worry about as well, such as the ravenous indigenous life. The sets are instantly amusing, though they re obscured by a precise color scheme that turns the imagery black-and-white with hints of various tints. Shadowy locales are bluish, while sun-scorched sand dunes are yellow; other colors are virtually nonexistent. If it didn t feel as if utilized to hide mediocre special effects, the palette might have been more effective. Distorted images, slow-motion in unnecessary moments, repeated camera angles, and rapid cuts also generate visual curiosities, which numb the effectiveness of the cinematography and action-oriented violence. Nevertheless, the exploration of the planet holds additional intrigue, particularly as the unprepared passengers investigate abandoned outposts and encounter other inhabitants.  All you people are so scared of me. Most days I take that as a compliment. But it ain t me you gotta worry about now.   Pitch Black  isn t smart sci-fi; instead, it s boilerplate survival horror, preoccupied with death, destruction, and monsters. Likewise, it s the type of thriller that employs a muscular hero and capable female sidekicks with obligatorily bared midriffs. There s also a curious subplot about idolizing Riddick s notoriety, with two teenaged survivors emulating his dress and demeanor   which doesn t quite fit with the rest of the action. Fortunately, this leads to a couple of surprises (chiefly in the order of demises), which proves a certain level of storytelling bravery from writer/director David Twohy. The dependence on CG antagonists, however, is a pity, as they doesn t hold up nearly as well as practical models (plus, inconsistencies abound with the designs, principally when the aliens swarm in the millions yet attack in small groups, perhaps a dozen at a time). This is true of the bloodshed, too, whose creativity suffers from unconvincing executions. The suspense fares better, especially when the characters are hunted down one by one in the inky confines of spaceship corridors or underground tunnels by toothy creatures that fear light. Riddick isn t the most innovative protagonist for a job like this, but his persona is macho enough to take the place of a more recognizable he-man (like a Stallone or Schwarzenegger). As for the supporting cast, they re given a dash of humor, credible cursing, and plenty of panicky infighting, generating a group dynamic that is reminiscent of  Aliens  or  The Thing  (Keith David has a role here, coincidentally)   just without a supremely satisfying conclusion.",CYQ_Doc3_PitchBlack,CYQ,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pitch Black
53,CYQ_Doc4_PitchBlack,"To mark it s 20th Anniversary, Pitch Black has been given the 4K remaster treatment by Arrow Video. The first film to feature Vin Diesel in his breakout role of anti-hero Richard B. Riddick, revisiting Pitch Black now Diesel has become as big a star as he is, it s quite refreshing to see how humble the beginnings are for both Diesel s breakout role and the character of Riddick (well, relatively to monster-fighting sci-fi movies). Sure, it may be another in a long line of Alien knock-offs, but at least it s a fun one! The film introduces Riddick aboard a passenger spacecraft on his way to prison, escorted by bounty hunter Johns (Cole Hauser) along with a crew of commercial passengers. When the craft is struck by shards of a comet, it crash lands on a planet with three suns, an impending eclipse, and an eerily abandoned mining facility. When the passengers discover that they re not alone on the planet s surface and are being hunted by a vicious race of aliens who only come out in the dark, they have to trust in the mysterious Riddick, whose enhanced eyesight may be the only key to their survival.  As far as  things that go bump in the night  concepts go, Pitch Black certainly has a doozy. Sure, it s convenient that the convict in chains has the one ability that should prove incredibly useful against creatures that only come out in the dark, but it only adds to the B-movie/John Carpenter-esque spirit of the whole enterprise. This is a fairly low budget sci-fi horror, and it gets decent mileage out of its premise, even if it does take a bit too long for the sun to go down. The opening act is where the film is at its weakest, setting up cliched characters as cannon fodder whilst it sets the stage for carnage to commence, all of which takes a little too long to let rip. The film is distinct in its aesthetic in these moments, with the three suns leading to three very different styles of lighting. As interesting a creative idea as this is, some of the cinematography can be quite harsh to look at, but it does demonstrate a desire to be a little different and have some visual identity that feels more unique, all the while making good use of its Australian Outback locations to develop a convincing alien world. When it comes to the action, director David Twohy clearly has a lot of fun with teasing his creatures in the shadows, which is often for the best as the early 00 s CGI never particularly looks convincing enough when they are revealed in full. The film is at its best when it s either combining practical and visual effects, or when it is throwing its characters out into the darkness with only a few flames and lamps to keep them safe. The creature designs may look a little like pale versions of the bugs in Starship Troopers, but there s enough menace to them to make the strolls out in the dark tense enough to keep you hooked. The most striking element of Pitch Black always was and remains Vin Diesel s performance as Riddick. It is quite surprising to revisit it in the wake of all that he has achieved with both this franchise and the box-office behemoth that is the Fast and Furious series. Riddick is undoubtedly a more interesting character than Diesel s Dominic Toretto, and he s also much more fun to be around. Pitch Black is always at its best when the film pulls Riddick more into focus, delivering little tantalising pieces of information about his past, while Diesel brings a great deal of wit and charisma to the character. It is a film that reminds you why this guy became a movie star. Pitch Black has never won too many points for originality, as it does hit the beats you d expect of a B-movie of its kind, with its pacing also coming in a bit too slack from time to time (this disc offers both the theatrical and director s cut, which features a couple more dialogue scenes that don t really need to be there). You can probably guess who is going to make it out alive from very early on, and it does often feel like it s trying to over-stretch its limited budget and capabilities at points. But it is fun to see how much of this still works as a character introduction to Riddick and as an early marker for Diesel s rising star. As knockoffs of its kind go, it s one of the more distinct. There s still a lot of fun to have with Pitch Black, and with the Arrow 4K upgrade, the darkness has never looked better.",CYQ_Doc4_PitchBlack,CYQ,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pitch Black
54,CYQ_Doc5_PitchBlack,"WHAT'S IT ABOUT? A passenger spaceship is hit by a rogue asteroid or comet and is forced to make a crash landing on a strange, barren planet that has three suns. The survivors include one crew member, a Muslim pilgrim and his family, an eccentric traveler, a couple of other passengers (i.e. alien food), a cop, and a prisoner named Riddick. All have their own dark secrets and hidden pasts. The survivors soon discover an abandoned geologic research station nearby. All of the scientists are gone, and we quickly find out why. Bizarre, bat-like nocturnal creatures live under the ground in the dark. They seem to be very hungry, too, and the scientists were their last meal. Take a creature from Aliens, mix it with a bat, a panther, and a hammerhead shark and you have these critters. There are also smaller, faster flying versions, too. The survivors realize they must stick together if they will make it off the planet, however most all of them are selfish in their own way. The motto of the group seems to be 'Let's stick together, because when the monsters come I only have to run faster than you to get away!' Can they make it out alive? They must transport some power cells to a small spacecraft at the outpost in order to get off the planet. But (and there's always a 'but') a rare eclipse of the three suns takes place and the planet becomes dark. The creatures then come out in force and the race to get away is on. Only light keeps the creatures at bay, but how long will that last? THE GOOD: Truthfully, I enjoyed this film. I wanted a good popcorn flick with cool effects and a lot of action, and that's what I got. The plot is not particularly deep, but for what it sets out to do, it does well. The cast was well chosen. Vin Diesel was excellent as the prisoner Riddick. He s tough, he's mean, and he's definitely no good guy, but you begin to like him nevertheless. Diesel played the part very well and I'd definitely like to see him play this character again. I think he'd be great in other action flicks. The rest of the cast did good jobs as well. The special effects weren't ground breaking caliber, but they were still good. The ship crash had some excellent moments and there is one particular scene where the creatures take flight at the beginning of the eclipse that is memorable. A really beautiful shot as clouds of the creatures swarm in the sky with the eclipse as a background. To make the planet a little more otherworldly, colored filters were used to give everything a different hue as if there was an alien sun and sky. I didn t like the effect at first, but in the end it did help make the terrain a bit less earth-like. I also liked some of the clever shots at the beginning when Riddick gets away and is stalking the survivors. Definitely one of the funnier parts of the film. Though this film borrows from Aliens, it is a little taste of what I hoped one of the Aliens sequels would have been. I always wanted Ripley and the Marines to go to the Alien homeworld, and I couldn't help but think this is a little bit of what that would have been like. (They did in the Dark Horse comics, but that s another story.) In any case, I was in the mood for this movie, so I enjoyed it. THE BAD: I didn't care for some of the filming techniques. Occasionally, the camera would shake all over the place. As Mr. Cranky once said in a review, it seemed as if the camera was strapped to a chimp to film the scene. All it did was make what was going on more confusing, and left me scratching my head as to what happened. Fights should be beautifully choreographed and appreciated, while this effect just seemed to cover everything up. There were also random slow motion shots that seemed to me to serve no purpose, and every once in a while the frame would be squashed and distorted for some sort of artsy effect. The story seemed to take its natural course, however, that unfortunately led to a rather anti-climactic ending. I was hoping for some big money shot and a slam bang finish, but it didn't happen. Maybe if the film had a bigger budget we would have seen more, but that wasn't to be. There were also some statements about God in the film. The Muslim keeps reaffirming his faith even though all these bad things happen to him, and Riddick ridicules him for his belief. I kept thinking by the end some statement would be made on faith one way or another, whether it be Riddick finding his faith or the Muslim losing his, but neither happened. Seemed like a missed opportunity.",CYQ_Doc5_PitchBlack,CYQ,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pitch Black
55,CYQ_Doc6_PitchBlack,"Science fiction is often described as ""a genre of ideas"". Science fiction films, on the other hand, speak against this definition. Ideas behind those films are often not particularly original or in any connection with common sense. It is in the way they are presented that make for the quality in science fiction films. PITCH BLACK, 2000 science fiction written and directed by David Twohy, is good example. The plot is set in distant future when a passenger space ship gets hit by meteorites and makes emergency landing on the surface of an unknown desert planet with three suns in the sky. Only a handful of people have survived the crash and Fry (played by Radha Mitchell), pilot who volunteers to become group's leader, has to deal with two problems   lack of water and Riddick (played by Vin Diesel), convicted murderer who was being taken to prison by his guard Johns (played by Cole Hauser) and who took the crash as an opportunity for escape. While Johns tries to talk other survivors in tracking him down, Fry discovers apparently abandoned human colony with conspicuously preserved space ship that could fly after minimal repair. Fry and others will soon discover the reason why there aren't any colonists   a total eclipse, which happens every 22 years, leaves the planet in complete darkness and brings some forms of the local fauna from the underground. The creatures can't stand the light but the darkness allows them brief opportunity to enjoy some exotic food on the surface. After its premiere PITCH BLACK was hailed as the new ALIEN, a SF horror classic in the same category with Ridley Scott's masterpiece. Although such praise wasn't justified, PITCH BLACK deserves to be recommended as a solid piece of genre entertainment. Twohy managed to overcome relatively low budget with ingenuity and good use of Australian locations. But the most important factor is human   Twohy learned a lot from Scott's film. The script allows audience to start caring for the characters and action scenes even allow for some minor glimpses into future world, which is in a way distant reflection of our own, with all of gender, race, religious, social and other differences. There are some interesting plot twists and many characters aren't what they are supposed to be. The acting is, of course, very good. Vin Diesel is very effective in almost iconic role of a ""cool"" but lovable rouge, while Radha Mitchell does nice job as Ripley-like pilot. Keith David, however, steals the show in the role of Muslim pilgrim. The major problem for PITCH BLACK is in this science fiction film, like so many recent Hollywood examples of the genre, not taking ""science"" very seriously. Too many elements of the plot are too convenient to bear serious scrutiny. Most of them deal with the bizarre ecology of the planet that is hard to reconcile with fauna described in the film. On the other hand, those who don't care much about little details are going to be entertained by superb acting, excellent action scenes and credible drama. At least for a while, PITCH BLACK brightened the prospects for all those who like quality science fiction in Hollywood.",CYQ_Doc6_PitchBlack,CYQ,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pitch Black
56,CYQ_Doc7_PitchBlack,"Is it an active contempt for the audience, I have to wonder, that propels a movie like Pitch Black through production, or is it mere laziness on the part of the filmmakers combined with the unspoken assumption   generally an accurate one   that moviegoers will watch just about anything with spaceships and lots of gore? Did some executive, considering greenlighting this script, chuckle evilly to himself while calculating precisely how insulting a movie he could produce and still have a decent opening weekend? Or was everyone so gung-ho on making a stylish sci-fi flick that it never occurred to anyone how nonsensical and even amoral the whole thing was?  Aliens meets The Fugitive meets Con Air,  is probably how writer David N. Twohy pitched his script. (Also credited as writers are Jim and Ken Wheat, which simply screams of fanboy brothers who wrote and, god knows how, managed to sell a spec script that had to be even more horrendous than what s onscreen, if the more experienced Twohy had to rewrite it.) Twohy   who actually did write The Fugitive, with Jeb Stuart   is also responsible for writing and directing another piece of junk science fiction, The Arrival, which is at least enjoyable on a Mystery Science Theater level. With Pitch Black, though, he descends to a new level of awfulness, in which even the film s highly derivative nature cannot make for campy fun. Pitch Black is not good clean bad fun   it is an insidious offense to any even halfway-demanding movie fan. Pitch Black starts out, if not exactly promising, then at least momentarily gripping. A commercial freight and passenger ship, traveling through deep space, encounters a meteor storm   the small projectiles that rip through the ship are enough to do it serious damage, as well as kill the captain as he sleeps in his cryo chamber. The pilot, Fry (Radha Mitchell), awakened by the ship to deal with the emergency, finds her ship already burning up as it screams through the atmosphere of a planet. In an intense, protracted sequence, the ship breaks up as Fry fights for control of it and manages to guide it to a not entirely disastrous crash landing on the planet s surface. It s the kind of sequence at the end of which you find yourself breathing a sigh of relief along with the characters. But Pitch Black immediately thereafter starts a long slide downhill that doesn t stop until the end credits roll. Only a handful of the ship s passengers have survived, including Johns (Cole Hauser: Good Will Hunting), a law-enforcement type, and his prisoner, Riddick (Vin Diesel: The Iron Giant, Saving Private Ryan), a thoroughly psychotic multiple murderer who, natch, has escaped his industrial-strength restraints in the crash. Besides Fry, there s also a Muslim imam (Keith David: Armageddon, Volcano) and several of his young sons, a teenage boy, and sundry others. The planet, a seemingly lifeless, endless desert under brutal assault by three suns, fortunately has an atmosphere entirely breathable by humans. The unlikeliness of humans landing by chance on a planet capable of sustaining them is typical of the kind of disregard for reality science-fiction films display, and it could be forgiven if that disregard didn t get much worse. There are, our little band discovers rather unpleasantly, nasty creatures living underground, big, flying things with huge teeth that look like a cross between bats and H.R. Giger s aliens. And they have a taste for human blood. My question is, Why? Why would these creatures be the least bit interested in humans? Predators and their prey develop in symbiosis, and humans and the aliens are products of entirely separate lines of evolution. Okay: I m getting too egghead. I ll ask a simpler question: What do these things live on when there are no humans around, which is most of the time? This planet has no ecology to speak of   these creatures are the only living things around. There is nothing for them to eat. Nothing. It makes no sense. Okay   still too intellectual. I shouldn t be thinking this much about what s meant to be a check-your-brain-at-the-door flick. But how much brainlessness are we meant to endure? After the discovery of the hungry creatures, Pitch Black becomes a standard  and then there were none  sci-fi horror flick. But it relies entirely on characters doing stupid, illogical things for no reason other than, if they didn t, there d be no story. Did I mention that there s almost always one sun in the sky of this planet? There is no night   except once every 22 years, when an eclipse blots out the suns. (Earth years? This planet s years? The concepts are used interchangeably, which, again, makes no sense   the chances of this planet and Earth having years of the same length are next to nil.) Fry discovers this when the group stumbles across a long-abandoned camp obviously used by a geological survey team, where Fry finds a model of this planetary system. It s vitally important for them to know how long the dark will last   they have no power to make artificial lights, and those creatures come out at night   but does Fry or anyone else advance the model along its track to see how long before the suns come up again? Of course not. When one of the Muslim kids goes missing, the first place it is suggested they look for him is in a building where they have to blast through the locks to get in. Now, the audience knows that the kid found a way inside, but if the characters in the film didn t know about that other way in, and thought the place was inaccessible, why would they look there first for him? How do they think the kid got in? I could go on and on with the list of character idiocies, but the truly offensive thing about Pitch Black is the fact that Riddick   remember, the psycho killer?   is the hero here. This is a man who obviously enjoys threatening everyone around him. He is not someone who committed a murder, say, in self-defense or even inadvertently in commission of another crime, like a robbery, and that s why he was in custody. This is a man who gets off on the fear he instills in the rest of the movie s characters. And his menacing is played for laughs. He taunts Johns, thrusting a gun in the other man s face, and cracks a catchphrase-style joke. When the teenage passenger starts to emulate Riddick, shaving his head like Riddick s and sporting the same sunglasses, this is meant to be an appropriate, and humorous, homage to a killer. And lest we be tempted to try to find something to soften Riddick as a character, to try to make him more palatable, Pitch Black s posters and advertising remind us to  Fight Evil with Evil.  And this is the character we re supposed to cheer on. I can t remember when this kind of positioning of a character in a film made me this angry. If Pitch Black has anything going for it, apart from the opener, it s that it s beautifully shot, at least in the scenes before the suns go down. Sure, it looks like one long Nike commercial, and no, a blue sun would no more make everything take on a bluish tinge than our yellow sun makes everything look yellow, but so what? It looks cool. So, in the words of The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy s Zaphod Beeblebrox, Pitch Black gets ten out of ten for style , but minus several million for good taste.",CYQ_Doc7_PitchBlack,CYQ,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch Black
57,CYQ_Doc8_PitchBlack,"No other movie opening thrills me more than a vast ship in interstellar space. The modern visual rules for these shots were set by Stanley Kubrick's ""2001,"" which used a detailed model moving slowly instead of a cheesy model moving fast. Kubrick had the good sense to know that sound does not travel in space, but ""Star Wars,"" with its deep bass rumbles, demonstrated that it certainly should. And then in the ""Alien"" and ""Star Trek"" pictures and in countless others, gigantic space cruisers aimed majestically at the stars, and I felt an inner delight that has its origins in those long-ago days when I devoured pulp space opera by Robert Heinlein and such forgotten masters as Murray Leinster and Eric Frank Russell. My state of mind is best captured by a pulp mag that was defunct even before I started reading science fiction: ""Thrilling Wonder Stories,"" without doubt the best title in the history of magazines. I hope for strange and amazing adventures. Sometimes I am gratified. More often I am disappointed. ""Pitch Black,"" which begins in deep space and ends with a manhunt on a desert planet, falls somewhere in between: clever, done with skill, yet lacking in the cerebral imagination of the best science fiction. How sad it is that humans travel countless light years away from Earth, only to find themselves inhabiting the same tired generic conventions. The movie begins during an interstellar mission, with the crew and a dangerous prisoner all in cryo-sleep. The ship collides with a cluster of rock fragments, which penetrate the hull like BBs through cellophane. The captain and several other sleepers are terminally perforated, and Fry (Radha Mitchell) assumes command. The ship crash-lands on a planet that circles somehow within a three-star system, where at least one sun never seems to set, and the surviving crew members have to fight it out with the vicious and cunning prisoner Riddick (Vin Diesel). You may remember Diesel from ""Saving Private Ryan,"" where he was the hard-bitten Pvt. Caparzo. He looks like a mean customer, and he is. He shares no fellow feeling with the other survivors, expresses no responsibility to them, does not consider himself in the same boat and thinks only of escaping. Oh, and his eyes have a remarkable quality: He can see in the dark. Not a very useful ability on a planet with three suns and no night, right? (Hollow laugh.) What disappointed me about ""Pitch Black,"" directed by David Twohy, is that it didn't do more with its alien world, and less with its recycled human conflicts. I feel underwhelmed when humans land on another world and are so quickly reduced to jumping out from behind rocks at one another and playing hostage games. ""Pitch Black"" does have a nice look, all bleached blues and desert sands. And there are some promising story elements, one of which I am about to discuss, so you might want to set this review aside if you plan to see the movie. The spoiler commences: Yes, night does fall on the planet, every once in a long while when all three suns are in eclipse. I am not sure what complex geometries of space and trajectory are necessary for a planet to exist in a three-star system and somehow manage to maintain any continuity of climate and temperature, but never mind: What is maybe more difficult to accept is that it would develop a life form that appears only in the dark. Since sunlight is the source of heat and energy, Darwinian principles would seem severely challenged by the task of evolving living things that hibernate for 22 years between eclipses. How does a thing that lives in the dark evolve in a planet where it is almost always daytime? This is not the kind of question you're supposed to ask about ""Pitch Black,"" but I'd rather have the answer than any 45 minutes of this movie. The story also poses the problem (less challenging from a Darwinian view, to be sure) of whether the Diesel character will cooperate with his species mates or behave entirely like a selfish gene. Whether this happens or not I leave it to you to discover. By the end of the movie, however, I was wondering if the trip had been necessary; most of the plot could be ported into a Western or a swashbuckler with little alteration. For Twohy, it's a step backward from ""The Arrival"" (1996), one of the smartest recent science-fiction films--one that really does develop suspense out of challenging ideas of alien conduct (space visitors are secretly warming the Earth to their comfort zone). My suggestion for his next film: an expedition to the seas beneath the ice of Io, where volcanic warmth may have allowed life to occur. Consider the physical properties of a life form that evolves under the tiny gravity of such a moon. It could be amorphous, tenuous and enormous. In sailing a stellar sub through the seas of Io, you might be navigating not toward life, but through it. What would a human crew do in such a situation? Not get into fights and start chasing one another through the sub, I hope.",CYQ_Doc8_PitchBlack,CYQ,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch Black
58,CYQ_Doc9_PitchBlack,"When a spaceship crash-lands on a planet of three suns that is plagued by darkness as a solar eclipse hits, the survivors must fight the nocturnal batlike alien creatures. These aliens avoid the light and strike when it s dark. The survivors include a dangerous murderer serving a life sentence in maximum security, Riddick (Diesel), who has surgically implanted eyes that shine enabling him to have night vision. He also has awesome muscles that are pumped for action. He wore specially fitted contact lenses to give him that shine job look. The survivors include: Riddick, who is in chains as he is being transported to another prison; the cruel guard, Johns (Cole Hauser), who it turns out has a few flaws in his personality   which include a morphine habit; and, the spacecraft s landing pilot, Fry (Radha Mitchell), who becomes the captain when it s discovered that the captain s throat had been slashed. These two leaders of the plan to get off the dark planet, Johns and Fry, argue all the time, and trust among the survivors becomes the issue. Fry had her moment of cowardice when landing the plane, as she almost panicked and pulled the cord to eject the passengers. This is something Johns uses against her. The other survivors include: a preachy Muslim imam, a holy man, talking up a storm about God; a prissy English antiquities dealer whose wine collection is used as lighting fuel to get them off this darkened wasteland. And a boy called Jack who turns out to be a girl named Jackie, as discovered through the efforts of Riddick s nose for sniffing out female hormones. This sci-fi formula action flick is noteworthy for its splendid cinematography, as it was filmed in the Australian Outback, and also for its innovative editing cuts. The story line left me gasping for more light and the acting left me in the dark searching for one line of dialogue that wasn t shrill or trite. No actor was provided with a challenging part, but Diesel uses his powerfully muscular presence and deep baritone voice to dominate his scenes. He comes to say one-liners such as:  They did not know who they were f*cking with!  He says this to the dead aliens after he puts them out of their misery, but he might as well have spoken it to a sleeping audience. The writer/director David Twohy (The Arrival) tries to bring some intelligence to the story, but the script is too shallow and predictable. The characters ranged from a shrill Radha to a cartoonlike Diesel. It is easy to root for the aliens to possibly, against all odds for such formulaic films, pick off all the survivors of the spacecraft. But three do survive and, in my opinion, that s three too many! This film didn t have a clue about what point it wanted to make. It was particularly unclear how good or bad they wanted to portray Diesel s character, as he kept changing from bad to good guy at every alien sighting. By the film s end I had an empty feeling, knowing I saw another special effect sci-fi film that couldn t bring on a story.",CYQ_Doc9_PitchBlack,CYQ,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch Black
59,CYQ_Doc10_PitchBlack,"CRITTER COMBAT lives, but it doesn't thrive. In David Twohy's new movie, ""Pitch Black,"" a dozen humans crash-land on a distant planet and re-fight the old cinematic battle of Them (big bugs, biotech hybrids, etc.) vs. Us. In Twohy's very slight variation on the ""Aliens""/""Starship Troopers"" theme, two antisocial people, a docking pilot and a homicidal prisoner, are rehabilitated by the tribulations of survival on a desert planet. It's a world that has three suns and, living underground, there's a host of Brancusi-like pterodactyls with steel heads and rubbery bods. A bounty hunter, a Moslem cleric and his young pilgrims, a female geologist, a girl unpersuasively disguised as a boy, and a wine collector (who must die for his stuffy connoisseurship) round out the group of castaways. The arid landscape is of a blinding intensity during the seemingly interminable day. And the predators, like many demonic figures, fear such light and hide out until nightfall. But there's a catch: With three suns chugging away, the only relief from the overwhelming blaze is an eclipse that takes place every 22 years. Coincidentally, the occurrence of that spectacular phenomenon, which will release the flying reptiles, is imminent. How, you may wonder, does the vast horde of night gobblers survive for so long without food? Well, the monsters eat any life form they can get their claws on and their voracity extends to cannibalism! But back to the moral lesson. The pilot, Fry (actress Radha Mitchell), flirted with the idea of dumping the cryogenically preserved passengers during the break-up of her space vehicle, but she's humbled by the subsequent human suffering and repents. Her ultimate conflict is with the unconvincingly redeemed murderer, upon whom the group has to rely because of his artificially enhanced night vision. This kind of sight is a tool granted to a few of those who live in the darkness of prison. The Hollywood industry - a great term for a place that just grinds out products instead of movies - is aware that its audience doesn't want to see anything new or different, so it offers titles like this, whose contents and intentions are reassuringly familiar. The screaming masses may very well respond to the excessive number of ""boo! cuts,"" shots that begin as revelations of something scary, then end as something harmless; the sudden cranking of the volume that makes us jump, even if we're just watching a cow chew on its cud; the overwhelming physical force of big eating machines counteracted by comparatively twerpy martial arts maneuvers; and barbaric, nihilistic heroes who are in no way admirable. (As to the last, when the soundtrack strings weep and we're asked to feel so much for a man who refuses to feel, we become pawns in an act of sentimental decadence.) Sadly, ""Pitch Black"" was directed by the man who made the best science fiction movie of 1996, ""The Arrival."" It's buttressed by interesting exobiological details, the thrill of scientific discovery, and the threat of an alien conspiracy that operates within NASA. But ""The Arrival"" was about an extraterrestrial menace that descends upon our home planet. It's a movie in which the everyday world is infiltrated by a cosmic Other , an encounter that produces marvelously surreal effects. Maybe it's time for Twohy to come back down to Earth.",CYQ_Doc10_PitchBlack,CYQ,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch Black
190,IHR_Doc1_DragMeToHell,"Drag Me to Hell might be the victim of unfair expectations, or just plain incorrect assumptions. This might partially be down to the advertising campaign, which could lead audiences to believing this is purely serious horror, when in fact it is pulp silliness in the vein of the old EC comics, and fully aware of it. Sam Raimi, for whom the childhood experience of reading those pulp tales served as an inspiration for his now-legendary ""Evil Dead"" movies, and hence gave him his career, has made his most fun and entertaining film since Army of Darkness, and probably his best since then as well (although I do need to see A Simple Plan again) in Drag Me to Hell, which feels like it could be an adaptation of one of those horror tales. Hopefully audiences will be expecting something along the lines of Evil Dead mixed with its sequels when they go in, or they could leave disappointed. Unless you're scared by old women and supernatural mumbo jumbo, unless you're a superstitious person, Drag Me to Hell probably won't be giving you any nightmares. Then again, I'm not scared by anything really. Still, one can't help but feel that this sort of thing (if done seriously) doesn't belong in today's age of rationality and would work only in the 50's, or maybe even then would be too late to really pack a punch. That's why this is, like the Evil Dead movies, a cartoon. It is one cartoony horror set-piece after the other, more often than not with an overt comedic edge, and always, always with its tongue firmly in cheek. The characters are well-realized enough for the movie to be endurable, and well-played too (Justin Long is perfect for the role regardless of how limited his range is and I can't imagine anyone but Lohman playing this particular role), but Raimi doesn't really care about them. He cares more about piling on the pulp gross-outs, resorting here to all sorts of unsavory things (including embalming fluid gushing out of a corpse into Lohman's mouth, one of a multitude of things Raimi takes pleasure in introducing to that particular orifice of Lohman's body), but not much blood at all. It isn't needed either, the PG-13 rating may sound like a limitation but it's hard to imagine this movie with much more gore, although there are a few things that happen off-screen that I would have LOVED to see on-screen, but that might be because I'm a horribly sick person. Utilizing an active, expressive camera akin to the sort of thing we saw in the Evil Dead movies, Raimi stages these ridiculous scenes with gusto and passion. This is not going to terrify many people, but it is absolutely terrific at being what it sets out to be- a live action EC comic. As long as you go in expecting that, you'll probably leave satisfied. I'd like to leave you with the wise words of AV Club critic Scott Tobias: He wants viewers to jump out of their chairs, to laugh and scream and cheer, and to nudge each other over the transcendent ridiculousness of what they're witnessing. This is junk film-making at its finest.",IHR_Doc1_DragMeToHell,IHR,Horror,Positive,Drag me to hell
191,IHR_Doc2_DragMeToHell,"From the intense opening scene to the stellar and shocking finale, Sam Raimi has officially returned to the horror genre with vigor and spark in the year's best horror film so far. Starring Alison Lohman in the leading role (Ellen Page was originally cast as the lead but dropped out of the project early in production), Drag Me to Hell feels like much more than your average, predictable horror popcorn flick. It's filled with plenty of twists and turns and, like any good ride, a satisfying conclusion. And the PG-13 rating? Forget about it! You hardly notice that little factor because of how immersed you become in the story. Also starring are Justin Long, David Paymer, and Lorna Raver.  Christine (Lohman), a loan officer at a bank with a lovely boyfriend (Long), is being considered for a promotion. Jumping at the opportunity, she comes across an old gypsy woman (Raver) who requests a third extension on her house. Her boss (Paymer) tells her it's a tough decision, and its her call, so she refuses the woman's payment. Absolutely infuriated, the woman stalks Christine after work and bestows her with a supernatural curse, one which she has only three days to overcome before the spirits drag her to hell.  Lucky enough to have won tickets to a pre-screening of the film, I had heard nothing but great things about it. I was hoping for the best, but I wasn't sure how the comedy and horror would mix together. Much to my surprise, the horror and comedy in Drag Me to Hell are that rare perfect mix of perfection that one craves in horror movies. If too funny, they can go overboard, but not this one. In fact, I don't think I've seen quite a proper mixture since Raimi's own Evil Dead II.  Perhaps the most shocking thing about the movie is how well it's made technically. It had all sorts of interesting shots and the real work of a master filmmaker. Having both written and directed the film, Sam Raimi more than proves his worth to the horror genre despite his long absence since Army of Darkness. In ways, this is also a sort of revival of what people with think of PG-13 horror movies. Drag Me to Hell is one of the most intense, scary horror films in quite some time, despite the PG-13 rating which many tag as already crap.  Drag Me to Hell is full of its epic shocks, and the less you go in knowing about it the better. I could go on for hours about the movie and spoil everything there is to know, but that would truly ruin some of its appeal. Which is certainly not to say that it is lost after a first viewing, just that it's an experience unlike any other going into this movie watching virtually no clips and reading very little about it. It becomes a truly rewarding experience.  Mrs. Ganush is one truly phenomenal villain that provides plenty of scares. Lorna Raver infuses the role with an enthusiasm - an terror - that is rarely seen in big-screen baddies. She has more personality than The Ring's Samara for sure. Clay's character provides a much-needed balance between the goofy and the horrific, and helps make the film's heroine, Christine, all the more believable. It was an interesting twist to see Justin Long in a horror film, despite the nature of his role. I believed his performance and the sincerity of his character. Lohman had a lot resting on her shoulders with this movie, and she totally pulled it off with flying colors. Nobody plays the terrified, but headstrong and determined female lead better than Lohman, and she proves her worth over and over again in this movie. She totally has a career ahead of her.  Overall, Drag Me to Hell did more than just impress me nonstop. It was a masterpiece of a horror movie, with unrivaled intensity, scares, and one killer of an ending. More often now, horror directors/writers seem to have such a difficult time ending their movies properly. This one has an ending which snugly solidifies the movie as an early contender for best horror film of the year. Don't miss Drag Me to Hell... you will never look at handkerchiefs the same way!",IHR_Doc2_DragMeToHell,IHR,Horror,Positive,Drag me to hell
192,IHR_Doc3_DragMeToHell,"Sam Raimi is known as one of the best horror directors around in recent years: but he had left the genre to do some small projects like the Spider-man trilogy. He returns with a story idea that he wrote with his brother wrote 10 years before filming it. He also set out to get his production company Ghost House back on track after a very unsuccessful run. Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) was a young woman and loans officer at a local branch of a bank. She has a simple ambition to become the assistant manager but has to compete with the new employee Stu (Reggie Lee). She is a kind-hearted woman, in a long term relationship with Clay (Justin Long), a psychology lecturer at a local university. Christine is told to make some touch decisions if she wants to get the job. She refuses to give an old woman, Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver) an extension on her loan: a decision she regards because Ganush places a curse on the young woman. Christine ends up being haunted by a demon and she has only three days to save her soul from being taken to hell for all eternity. With the help of Clay and an Indian psychic, Rham Jas (Dileep Rao) Christine does everything she can to break the curse. With the horror genre you get a number of different types: serious like Let the Right One In, 28 Days Later, the Exorcist; slashers, e.g. Halloween, Friday the 13th; gorno like Hostel, Saw; comedy, e.g. Shaun of the Dead. And of course you can also sub-divide into types like Supernatural, monster-based, psychological, realistic, etc With the best horror films there is often deeper message behind the story and often focuses on great characters. Raimi obviously knows about putting a compelling protagonist in his film and the audience will care about Christine, a decent person who ends up having to explore her dark side so that she can save her soul. Christine extremely well played by Lohman who shows she is a competent actress, playing the lost young woman who has to toughen up quickly. She is joined by a decent cast, Rao and Raver were of particular note. Raimi did not set out to make the film too serious. There is not much of message except showing someone's dark survival instincts, but trying to retains some good and don't upset gypsies. Does not treat the film too seriously with violence moments of slapstick, like Christine using a stapler as a weapon and dropping a anvil on top of Ganush with the eyes popping out like in a cartoon. Raimi deliberately makes Ganush an over the top stereotype and very entertaining, you would have to be of a very sensitive disposition to be offended. Also, there is nothing funny and more surreal then a talking goat. Raimi also knows how to create an effective creepy atmosphere, using shadows to show demon was very well done. With his experience with Spider-man Raimi uses a lot of CGI in the film. Admittedly I am a traditionalist, CGI should only be used when there is no other alternative: but Raimi is skilled to make keep the film engaging and it allows him to use to do some extraordinary things. Raimi also mixed slapstick level violence and some gross out with more realistic style which at times effective, other times, not so fitting. Raimi was even able to fit in a few one liners, particularly with Christine nearing the end of the film. Raimi also shows his skill with a few clever camera and editing tricks, like when Christine was in a rainstorm and it turns into her being in the shower, which were nice touches. Plot wises the film was a little like Paranormal Activity: but it was a lot better then that poor excuse for a film. The main reason being that there was a real threat to the main character of the film to make you actually care about her and the events of the film. The demon was actually a creepy being, not a minor nuisance. Raimi shows that a horror film can be violence but does not have to be meaningless or violent just for the sake of it. Raimi gets the balance just right and the body court is surprising low in this film. But whilst Drag Me to Hell is a good film this is really a film for fans of the horror genre. Outsiders properly won't be won over.",IHR_Doc3_DragMeToHell,IHR,Horror,Positive,Drag me to hell
193,IHR_Doc4_DragMeToHell,"Drag Me To Hell, Sam Raimi's first non-Spiderman film since 2000, was released in my city more than a week ago, on 21 August 2009, but just yesterday I finally had the chance to check it out on the big screen (last weekend was very hectic). I'm glad, my introduction to the non-Spiderman Raimi was fantastic and yes, even thought I own since more than a year ago Raimi's first feature film, The Evil Dead, on DVD I only can say that from him I have seen nothing more aside of this, the 3 Spider-man films and some parts of both Darkman and Army of Darknessshame on me, I f****** know! But I promise to myself that I will finally see The Evil Dead during this week (and Army of Darkness and Darkman as soon as possible), but well before that happens let's add some more words to this IMDb comment of Drag Me To Hell Sam Raimi's film (he also wrote it together with his brother Ivan Raimi) opens in a typical way: we have the case that will be similar to the one that our main character will have to deal with, of course it happens many years before and of course it will be always be present in the course of the film to finally make the direct connection with our main character. And is Alison Lohman who plays this main character (thank god Ellen Juno Page dropped out the film!), she is the lovely Christine Brown and she is really great. Of course Christine will be the one dealing with the not quite normal stuff that of course would be just freaking unbelievable for almost everybody, and boy is she going to suffer. And she is basically alone, I mean sure her boyfriend (played by Justin Long) is there supporting her but is just her thing, certainly she will have to believe in well in f****** anything, the words of a psychic will be as believable as ever for her! Like I said, Drag Me To Hell is typical, is a simple film that works just about fine with the normal plot of having our main character cursed, suffering and of course seeking for help, for the way to give herself, and us, a happy ending. And it works just about fine for those touches, for those really cool touches and for those really good and enjoyable performances by its entire cast. Justin Long, Lorna Raver, Dileep Rao, Reggie Lee, Adriana Barraza deserves a mention since they all are truly great, delivering lots of fun and memorable moments. Starting with a really cool and intense fight between the two main women of the story (Christine and, Lorna Raver's character, Sylvia Ganush) the film is full of ingenious parts, is of course full of scenes that will make your girlfriend jump off her seat and make expressions of disgust. The film is conventional in many ways of course but Raimi's touches are really terrific, those scenes that are simply funny and, mostly, those that are fun because of being sort of over the top are enough to make of this worth watching material. For example, the stuff with the cat of the protagonist: sure the ""hey kitty kitty"" is funny, and of course ultimately scary, but the ""I don't want your cat, you dirty pork queen!"" with the cat being returned to its owner is just f****** cool, just f****** fun time at the movies. Or the stuff with the boss of Christine (played by David Paymer), I mean the bloody problem of Christine, that is first scary and embarrassing for Christine, second f****** cool and fun with the boss soaked of blood and third just plain hilarious with the boss just worried for not having blood in his mouth. It's crazy time at the movies, with a crazy and vengeful old lady, an annoying fly (loved when it touches the camera), psychics that for once are not full of s***, a poor but ultimately insane goat and a poor young womanI just had a truly great time watching Raimi's latest work.",IHR_Doc4_DragMeToHell,IHR,Horror,Positive,Drag me to hell
194,IHR_Doc5_DragMeToHell,"Known to many for making the block-buster ""Spiderman"" series, Sam Raimi began in his career in 1981 with a wonderful little gem called ""The Evil Dead."" The 1981 horror classic featured everything a good horror movie is supposed to be: scary, gory, at times weirdly funny, and entertaining. When I saw ""The Evil Dead,"" I wondered if Raimi would ever return to horror again. 2009's ""Drag Me To Hell"" is the answer that was given. Raimi has finally gotten a chance to leave the ""Spiderman"" franchise and actually do something that old fans would remember him by. There's only three words to describe ""Drag Me To Hell"" and those words are: A PERFECT MOVIE! Alison Lohman stars as Christine Brown, a woman who is living a happy life with her boyfriend Clay, and she has a great job at the bank. But when an old gypsy woman, Sylvia Ganush, comes to Christine, begging for another extension on her mortgage payment, Christine is faced with a challenging decision. Will she impress her boss and win the assistant manager position or will she help Mrs. Ganush out and never be able to make tough decisions? Christine goes for the first choice. Bad mistake, because Mrs. Ganush puts a curse on Christine. It is the curse of the Lamia, a furious demon that tortures its victims for three days until it finally drags you to hell to burn for eternity. Can Christine be able to find a way to stop the curse before it's too late? Despite its PG-13 rating, ""Drag Me To Hell"" is a superior horror film with nonstop scares, gratuitous gross-out moments, a very dark sense of humor, and it's fun to watch. Raimi doesn't just put Christine through hell, but he does it with the audience too. I was jumping in my seat so many times, talking to the screen, and I actually felt my adrenaline pumping, stuff that hasn't happened to me in a long time in a horror movie. It makes you remember classic horror film rules: If a disgusting gypsy woman with bad dentures, a blind eye, leper fingernails and endless phlegm coming out of her mouth needs your help, you don't ignore her. You help that woman out! There are plenty of slashers and haunted house movies, but there aren't so many people getting cursed. Raimi's horrific story is just a little bit formulaic, but he takes it and makes it his own. Gypsy curses have never been this violent or scary. The cast obviously had a good time making the movie because their performances are awesome. I really enjoyed watching Alison Lohman play Christine. I haven't watched a lot of her movies, but this one shows that she's very underrated and deserves bigger roles. Great job, Lohman! Justin Long has starred in another very popular horror movie called ""Jeepers Creepers."" He is also very good here as Christine's boyfriend Clay, the dude who is always telling her that everything is okay and nothing is coming for her. Hah! Welcome back to horror, Mr. Long. David Paymer is very funny as Christine's boss. Dileep Rao makes a very good psychic as Rham Jas. And Lorna Raver shines as Ganush. Raimi has created the most disgusting gypsy ever. Sam Raimi directs ""Drag Me To Hell"" with such energy and love for the genre. This is the guy who obviously always loved horror movies. He never holds back on scares and gross-outs. And the effects here are remarkable. Thank God Raimi has returned to horror. Peter Travers has called ""Drag Me To Hell"" ""horror movie heaven,"" which it very well is. You'll completely forget that it's rated PG-13 and you'll have a fantastic time jumping in your seat, screaming, and laughing. ""Drag Me To Hell"" stands as one of 2009's best horror movies in line with ""My Bloody Valentine 3D,"" ""The Last House on the Left"" and ""Friday the 13th."" Now, let's see what ""Sorority Row"" and ""Jennifer's Body"" can do.",IHR_Doc5_DragMeToHell,IHR,Horror,Positive,Drag me to hell
195,IHR_Doc6_DragMeToHell,"Firstly I HAVE to give this film a 1/10 to get the ratings down. I just got back from the cinema after watching this crap and I expected the IMDb rating to be 5 or lower. Imagine my surprise when it has 8/10! This film is all too predictable. Think of Stephen King's Thinner meets The Haunting In Connecticut. I walk into the cinema and there is NO ONE else there. The film starts with some Mexican boy being possessed and I thought the film was going to be one of those spoof horror-comedies when I saw over-the-top creepy shadow hands crawling over the ceiling. He gets dragged off to hell because he was cursed by a gypsy whose necklace he stole. Some Mexican woman looks on and promises to get revenge on the spirit that did it. When that scene finished we're taken to the life of Christine Brown, a loan officer for Wilshire Pacific Bank. She's after a promotion to position of Assistant Manager but so is her rival - the Asian Company Agent from Prison Break season 2. She's day dreaming when some old gypsy woman starts asking her if the bank could give her more time on a mortgage repayment she missed. Christine, wanting to impress the boss, says no and so the gypsy then begs her, lunges at her and is then dragged out kicking and screaming. To be honest I thought that was simply horrible and I thought immediately that she deserved what happens but then we cut to a spooky underground car park (a setting used far too much for suspense and cheap scares) where the gypsy is waiting in Christine's car. Now here is the only time in the film where I WAS surprised. I thought the gypsy would curse her like in Thinner but instead starts attacking her with great strength and agility and it was quite funny to watch. One bit that was funny was when the gypsy's false teeth smash and she tries biting Christine with gums. Anyway, the whole fight seemed pointless as all she did was take a button from Christine's coat, curse it and give it back and THEN the predictability starts. Christine and her boyfriend drive home where she starts getting creeped out with noises and seeing scary things with sharp teeth. Before she goes home she sees an Indian fortune teller who just happens to know EVERYTHING about the curse and was luckily just next to her boyfriend's parked car. He says she's cursed and makes no attempt to help her. After a half hour of miscellaneous scares and going to see the gypsy to retract the curse again just like in Thinner (I KNEW the old bag would be dead), she sees Indian man again. He says make a sacrifice so she kills her pet cat instead of finding a stray and I KNEW it wouldn't work. Meanwhile at work, she has a nose bleed so intense that she sprays blood everywhere and no one phones a doctor or anything. They just do nothing while she runs away. So back she goes to Indian man who says he knows this woman and you know what's coming: a standard Hollywood scary exorcism scene done by the Mexican woman from the first scene in the film (what a coincidence). Here we're told that to remove the demon, Indian man, Christine, Mexican woman and another Mexican man have to hold hands, summon the demon and transfer it to a goat. Kill the goat and it's over. The goat starts to talk when it's possessed but of course the plan doesn't go ahead properly and the Mexican man gets bitten and is possessed. Mexican woman chants and the spirit is gone but Mexican woman dies for no reason. Indian man puts the cursed button in an envelope and says to give it to someone else and THEY will be dragged off to hell instead. She lies to her boyfriend saying it's all over and drops the envelope in the car and picks it up again. She ponders giving it to the Asian man from Prison Break but can't so back to Indian man again who says to give it to the gypsy's corpse. So over she goes to the cemetery, digs up the corpse and puts it in her mouth. Next scene, she's all happy and I KNEW it wasn't a happy end. When she dropped the envelope in the car she mixed it with another envelope with a coin in it so she never got rid of it. She's dragged to hell while boyfriend watches and cries and it's over. Predictable standard horror. If gypsies can curse people so easily, they should be ruling the world. Why didn't she use those powers to make payments or whatever? It makes no sense. Why this has such a high rating I don't know. It relies on shock scares too much with the plot being too ridiculous. The Indian man was ridiculous. Why didn't he just say give the button back to the gypsy or take her to the exorcist in the first place?",IHR_Doc6_DragMeToHell,IHR,Horror,Negative,Drag me to hell
196,IHR_Doc7_DragMeToHell,"On the way to the theater, I tell my buddy ""This has an 8.0 on IMDb, it MUST be good!"" Ummm...No. I've seen better movies on a 3-D View-Master! OK, so the movie begins with the main character, aptly played by the wet-dream-inducing Alison Lohman, getting a cursed placed on her by an old lady who's about to get evicted from her home unless the bank helps her out. Every clich  in the book is thrown at you to get you on the side of Alison, a bank employee who decided to help throw the old lady on the street for the benefit of the bank. (The film-makers resort in their attempt to show remorse towards Alison...to showing the old lady having terrible hygiene, her contempt towards Alison, disgusting habits, and emptying the bank candies into her purse). The old lady, by the way, apparently has ""powers"" the rest of us don't, like the ability to place a deadly curse on others, having super-human strength and tremendous dexterity while fighting, and having the knowledge that Alison could potentially have helped her personally (although she wasn't near the conversation Alison had with the bank manager). The curse described by the old lady then begins happening to Alison. She goes to a palm-reader (a guy who has a knack for not mentioning extremely important things until it's nearly too late) and he tells her that she is cursed. I cannot overstate the stupidity of this palm-reading character (played by Dileep Rao). If there ever was a ""Professor for the Occult"" at your local University, this character would be it! He informs Alison that she would be tormented by a demon for 3 days...then the demon would come for her and drag her to hell. Alison asks Dileep if there is anything that can be done. He says ""Well, you can attempt an animal sacrifice that might appease the demon"". (I thought the word ""might"" wasn't very reassuring for a person in the midst of a fight from hell!) Anyway, Alison doesn't pick up a stray cat or one destined for the back room of her local animal shelter...no, she uses her own precious kitty for the slaughter! After murdering her kitten, she thinks everything is now fine, as a day or so goes by without incident. As the 3-day-clock is ticking down, she gets terrorized by the demon again, goes back to Dileep and proceeds to verbally beat him like a rented mule. Dileep then (AND FINALLY I MIGHT ADD) says ""Well...I know this special lady who does exorcists and can drive the demon out...but it's costly, $10,000, and you need the money tonight."" ** Note, I yelled out in the theater: ""Could you mail that suggestion back to 2 days ago when I originally asked about what can be done?!"" -- the crowd began laughing hysterically! ** Anyway, her boyfriend (played by Justin Long's mangina) gets wind that she needs the 10K and gives it to Dileep on her behalf. I'd like to quickly add this eye-rolling sequence. Alison decides to show up at the old lady daughter's creepy mansion of a house to ask for forgiveness and to tell the old hag that she would help her get the house back. The daughter answers the door and tells her to leave...then oddly lets her in after a rude verbal tongue-thrashing. Alison walks into the house...it's very quiet...she is led through some rooms, down some stairs...then asks ""Where is she?""...and her host says ""Right around the corner""....she turns the corner, and get this, A PARTY IS ENSUING! People drinking, eating, talking...a scene inconsistent with a house that looked as if it hadn't had a visitor in years...and with not many cars parked out in front as Alison walked up...and knowing you hadn't heard a sound the entire time Alison was walking through the house! The scene ends with you finding out that this is actually a gathering for the old lady's funeral. How do you find this out? Alison, not paying attention to where she's walking in an odd house full of strangers, trips over the old lady's casket, making her fall out of the casket and on top of Alison, where the old lady pukes embalming gel all over her face. Wow. You can't make this stuff up. Back to story. Dileep then takes Alison to his psychic friends house. This lady was the most clich  of all the chock-full-of-clich  people in the movie. She was fully equipped with mood-rings, the ugliest new-age jewelry possible, candles galore and items from the occult (one item on her s ance table, I noticed, was a dated and dusty jar that was completely empty...oohhhh, scary!). I won't spoil things here, other to say that the exorcism doesn't go well and there's a talking goat. (Yes). After things go badly, and Alison feels she is destined for Hell, Dileep offers up one more piece of advice that would have been best said 2 days ago. (This guy is the king of yesterday's news!) Dileep, amazingly enough, tells her that she can simply give the curse away as a gift...but the recipient would go through the same hell she is and would be dragged to hell themselves in 3 days! Much to my surprise...NOT!...She can't possibly think of ANYONE who she can gift this curse to! She sees an old creaky man...yes!...Oh, his wife shows up, nevermind. She calls her rival at work...she could kill 2 birds with 1 stone by gifting him the curse...Nah, he's too sad now, nevermind! So she decides to, again, get this, go to the graveyard and dig up the body of the old lady so she can shove the gift down her throat! Wow. I told my buddy ""She should give it to George W Bush!"" But, seriously, she couldn't have visited a prison and gave it to a rapist or murderer? That would have required logic I guess...something this movie lacks badly.",IHR_Doc7_DragMeToHell,IHR,Horror,Negative,Drag me to hell
197,IHR_Doc8_DragMeToHell,"Is this the best story line Hollywood can come up with? A gypsy curse? Is that supposed to be original in some way? Why is it that gypsies always have the power to kill people and curse people to death but can't seem to pay their bills on time or go to the dentist? This movie made me realize that Sam Raimi is one of the worst directors of all time. He's made one half-decent movie, The Evil Dead. The other two in the Evil Dead series were totally stupid, with a couple of funny lines that caught on in the cult film world. Evil Dead 3 was total garbage. People want to make the Evil Dead series more than what it is, which is just plain bad. Spiderman sucked as well. Anyway, back to this piece of crap. So this gypsy lady with a very fake accent can't pay her bills, even though she has a clan of relatives who appear later on at her house having a party. Her false teeth fall out, but when she goes to put them back in, you can see the actress's REAL TEETH right before the cut. Then, after stealing a bowl of candy, she begs for a break on her loan even though she's already proved herself to be a deadbeat and an actress with a really terrible fake accent. So who's fault is that? The loan officer, of course. And she deserves to die for doing the right thing! And this is basically the outline for this horrible pathetic excuse for a horror movie. Then, the Mexican lady wants a shot at the demon. She's been waiting to confront it for many many years. It's been her life long goal to confront the demon that is now after the loan officer. She will risk her life to get this demon, and wants to be paid 10,000 dollars to do it! What? If she wanted the demon so bad why not do it for free? This sets up the totally stupid and done a thousand times holding hands around a table and then the floating dancing guy during comedic music (evil dead crap.) So that doesn't work and suddenly the Indian guy tells her to give the button to someone else. Why NOW? Why not when he first found out about the stupid button curse did he not reveal this tidbit of info and save a few lives in the process? And what happened during the nose bleed scene? When blood shoots 30 feet out someone's nose, coating the room and a few people in blood, do you call an ambulance or act like the person had a paper cut? Oh, let's not forget the constant shooting of various liquids into the loan officer's mouth. Constantly. THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE MOVIE! Plus the inserting of an arm and some eyeballs into her mouth as well. What kind of perverted weirdo directed this movie? How does it end? Well, the loan officer, who is dating that ass-head 14 year old PROFESSOR who drives a PRIUS (the liberals got that right) gets dragged to hell after buying a new coat. Why did she need that coat so bad? I'm sick of thinking about this pile of crap. Do not watch.",IHR_Doc8_DragMeToHell,IHR,Horror,Negative,Drag me to hell
198,IHR_Doc9_DragMeToHell,"I am not the kind of guy that throws around *1's too easily, really. This is probably the only title I ever rated this low, although there are probably worse movies out there (some of which I've already seen but appreciated the irony or at least the will to create something worth watching)  This movie however was borderline the most boring excuse of a movie I have ever watched. Period.  But I try not to be too biased reviewing this movie. Let's think about it objectively.  Story: An old gypsy woman asks a loan officer for a 3rd extension on her house and the soulless bitch refused, so naturally the old hag curses the Blondie - a demon will haunt her until he finally ""drags her to hell"". Her boyfriend does the horror-clich  ""ghost don't exist"" routine but follows her to a guy with a fake foreign accent spiritual-whatever who fake looks at his watch, like ""oh, look at the time!"" and when he turns to leave he subtly tells her, like ""oh, by the way, you are f***ed"". Then nothing happened, a little haunting, a little spitting blood, a little haunting, at a dinner she looses her mind over it, little haunting until she arrives at the final showdown with the spiritual-whatever and another spiritual-whatever-women with her son or I don't know. As you can guess, at the first quarter of the movie I wasn't too interested into the movie anymore. It was probably after the scene where the old gypsy women spewed CGI-spit on the ""protagonist"" at her own funeral. In the end she has to dig up the grave of the gypsy women and fight against the powerful corpse in the hole to find out her boyfriend found the button. Oh yes, the button which the gypsy women took from the Blondie and cursed it. Well, all said and done the women falls on the rail-tracks in a station and gets ""dragged to hell"".  The effects: Bad bad bad CGI. It wasn't bad enough to be entertaining again, it was more like ""Anaconda""-style-CGI, back when they actually tried to make it look cool. It was ridiculous.  The characters and the acting: No likable characters, the protagonist keeps insisting she wasn't a bad person and kept blaming it on her manager when he said it was her decision to give the gypsy women an extension or not. The boyfriend is a bad sitcom-actor who really felt out of place. The spiritual-guy has never done a first-aid-curse in his life, which I thought was weird.  The conclusion: I get the irony, or at least I hope they tried to make it a comedy. Then I would at least honor the try. But I didn't laugh and I wasn't scared and the movie did NOT ""drag me into it"" like a movie is supposed to do. In fact I started writing on my phone and calling people what they are up to so I can do something to get my mind off of this garbage.

199,IHR_Doc10_DragMeToHell,"Going in to the movies to see this I really didn't know what to expect. I had seen MySpace ads around as well as a commercial I barely glimpsed at. Still like a typical horror movie I went in expecting greatness, despite being disappointed 9/10 times. Now, prior to going in I was unaware the man who made this also did the Evil Dead series. In all fairness I loved those movies as a kid when my dad showed me them on VHS. They were scary and weird so it was still enjoyable despite the oddness. Drag me to Hell on the other hand, well I seriously considered leaving the theater. If you want to simply jump throughout the movie you're in luck, it uses about 20 or so clich  suspense moments to get you scared. Now, I've watched plenty of horror movies in my day so disliking the movie had nothing to do with disliking ""gross"" things- but the amount of goo in this movie was just unnecessary and only there for the sake of being gross. While I now understand the comical-horror scenes in this movie (As I'm now aware of the creator) for newcomers to the maker, or just casual moviegoers in general it doesn't make sense to be in there. If we come for a scary movie we don't expect to see Looney-Tune situations. Laughter amidst a horror movie may be a nice break and all, but it just makes the movie look silly, low budget, badly written, and not serious considering the rest of the movies mood. The acting for this was mixed, it was either over the top and unneeded or just awkward. Later we meet the Boyfriend's parents who are clearly wealthy. While they went for a ""smug rich people"" act it just seemed like acting of a cheap television show. Personally I found the music and sounds to be terrible in this movie, I apologize if this is coming off as a rant but I'll explain. Drag me to Hell is LOUD, extremely so; in the suspense scenes people were covering their ears due to the loud pitch. Musically it was just inappropriate, during one particular horror scene they chose a Jazz-like bass rift. CGI in the movie was decent, nothing award-winning but it worked despite certain scenes looking as if they were from the 1987 Evil Dead film. The style mirrored that of ""My Bloody Valentine"" where everything appeared ready for 3D (assuming you didn't see that in 3D) On paper, the plot is good. Or at least it started good, though realistically its just your typical ""Somethings going to possess you and haunt you, we need to do an old ritual to end it"" film (See also: The Eye, The Unborn, Etc.) To sum things up, I wasted my time and money by seeing this movie. While I would like to appreciate it as the ""Comeback of a great horror director"" I just refuse to call it anything more than a cult hit. Don't see this movie, its a jumbled mess of random acts thrown together to create suspense just for the sake of doing so.",IHR_Doc10_DragMeToHell,IHR,Horror,Negative,Drag me to hell
150,MBA_Doc1_Us," We re Americans.  That phrase, delivered in a deathless, deadpan drawl, echoes through the twists and turns of a movie whose very title slyly evokes the common abbreviation for United States. Having taken a scalpel to the covert racism of gliberal America in Get Out, writer-director Jordan Peele turns his gaze inward for this rip-roaring follow-up, which is fearsomely entertaining, consistently thought-provoking and occasionally bloody scary. A Twilight Zone mashup of Dostoevsky s The Double and Jack Finney s The Body Snatchers, spiced up once again by a wit reminiscent of vintage Ira Levin, it s a modern fable that locates our anxieties about outsiders in a guilty fear of ourselves. The result plays like a mirror-image riposte to the French-Romanian home-invasion horror Ils (Them), suggesting that, contrary to Sartre, hell is not other people; it is us.   There are thousands of miles of tunnels beneath the continental US,  declares the film s ominous opening statement.  Many have no known purpose at all.  This sets the unsettling scene for a 1986 prologue in which a young girl in a Thriller T-shirt wanders away from her parents at a Santa Cruz beach fairground. Entering the Vision Quest hall of mirrors, the child sees something terrifying and traumatising   or is it just her own reflection? Thirtysomething years later, the adult Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong o) returns to that same beach with her family: goofy husband Gabe (Winston Duke); argumentative teen daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph); and anxious son Jason (Evan Alex), who hides his face behind a monster mask.  Haunted by her childhood, Adelaide has  a hard time just talking , particularly in the company of the Tylers, the dysfunctional white family whom Gabe envies but the rest of his brood merely tolerate.  I don t feel like myself,  Adelaide insists, pleading to leave the summer home that is bringing back so many memories. But when a shadowy family arrive on the Wilsons  doorstep, it soon becomes clear that they can run, but they can t hide from themselves.  There are enjoyable arguments to be had regarding what Us is really  about . Is it a classic return-of-the-repressed tale in the manner of Jekyll and Hyde (everyone has a shadow, a dark side) or a broader parable about affluent society s parasitical relationship with a hidden underclass, like Wes Craven s underrated The People Under the Stairs? Crucially, Peele allows his audience to play it both ways   to decide for themselves what s so scary about these subterranean visions and the spectres they bring forth.  Slipping nimbly between the registers of domestic sitcom and sociopolitical shocker, Us takes time to establish its family dynamics before throwing the Wilsons (and us, the audience) to the wolves. It s time well spent, ensuring a deep emotional investment in the characters that keeps us tethered to them even as the narrative descends into madness. Throughout, the attention to small details gives the bigger picture clout   the bickering dinner-table conversations that concisely establish each character s strengths and weakness; the throwaway comments that cleverly set up a late-in-the-day revelation; the mimicked human gestures that creepily recall the satire of George Romero s Dawn of the Dead.  Mirror images are everywhere, from the symmetrical shape of the oversized scissors that are the intruders  weapon of choice (a nod to Kenneth Branagh s Dead Again?) to the numbers on a digital clock that recall a briefly glimpsed apocalyptic sign ( Jeremiah 11:11 ) and are almost inaudibly echoed in a TV sports commentary that burbles away in the background. When an irritable Zora insists that  there s fluoride in the water that the government uses to control our minds , her petulant words strike a distant chord, subliminally alerting viewers to an unfolding mystery. No wonder Adelaide feels threatened by the accelerating coincidences that suggest that her nemesis is  getting closer .  While Us is definitely an ensemble piece, special credit is due to Nyong o, who commands two pivotal roles with a conviction that is simultaneously engaging and alarming. Hats off, too, to choreographer and movement consultant Madeline Hollander for bringing a shiversome physicality to the shadow roles that recalls the creepiest moments from Hideo Nakata s Ringu.  Amplifying the underlying themes of Peele s script is Michael Abels s exhilarating score, which blends brooding polytonal drones with stabby strings, interspersed by inventive use of the human voice. A quasi-gothic choral Anthem evokes the chills of Jerry Goldsmith s Ave Satani from The Omen, while jukebox tracks by Luniz, Minnie Riperton and (most pointedly) NWA are strategically deployed to hilariously horrifying effect.",MBA_Doc1_Us,MBA,Horror,Positive,Us
151,MBA_Doc2_Us,"Expectations for Peele s follow-up were skewed accordingly. Yet any rumours that his sophomore outing, Us, is  just  a straight-ahead scare-fest seem exaggerated. Although it is foremost a highly entertaining and well-executed horror movie, Us is shot through with its own strain of social criticism. Here the subject is not race, but class, with the film introducing an underworld of voiceless doppelgangers armed with lethal scissors and clad in blood-red onesies that recall, all at once, prison uniforms, working class coveralls and, yes, Delirious-era Murphy.  The film opens on the Santa Cruz boardwalk circa 1986, where a father wins a prize (a baggy Thriller T-shirt, no less   here Peele lucks into his zeitgeistiness) for his young daughter. Ignored by her quarrelling parents, the child ambles into a hall of mirrors, where she meets another a girl, who appears to be her exact double. Cut to 30 years later, and the girl is now a married mother of two played by Lupita Nyong o, back in sunny Santa Cruz for a beach holiday with her own family. In a film abounding with imagery of doubles, mirrors, rhymes and reflections, it should be no surprise that history repeats itself, with Nyong o s young son wandering near the same carnival attraction, and baiting a clan of (almost) exact doubles of his entire family back to their beach house.  From here, Peele develops a genuinely thrilling, heart-in-the-throat-scary horror picture. The archly creepy doubles   called  the Tethered,  after the manner in which they are existentially bound to their above-ground versions, like shadows   are a monster worthy of the Universal logo that precedes the film s opening titles. Peele exhibits a mastery of his camera, of managing suspense, and of teasing (and rewarding) the intimation of violence. He s also an exceptionally talented director of actors. Nyong o s physicality in her dual role as both herself and her Tether is revelatory. (Also excellent: Winston Duke as her husband, whose manner suggests a burlier on-screen surrogate for Peele himself; and Tim Heidecker and Elisabeth Moss as their gaucher, more garishly wealthy friends.)  Nyong o s physicality in her dual role as both herself and her Tether is revelatory.  Peele possesses a distinct talent for handling horror and comedy simultaneously, such that jokes landing in the midst of sustained suspense and wanton violence feel both natural and cathartic. There are multiple scenes in which pitched screams descend into fits of laughter, which feels like as fine a trademark for writer/director/producer Peele as his recurring image of a single tear dripping down a face seized by abject terror.  Strangely, this sophomore effort feels like more of a proverbial  calling card picture  than Get Out. It s as if Peele, rattled by his own hype, is straining to show what he can do as a straight-ahead craftsman, absent all the talk of him being a generational talent with a gift for articulating the issues vexing America. The film s critique of classism   present not only in the central family s war against the Tethered, but their hostility toward Heidecker and Moss s family, with their Botox and smart-home and more souped-up holiday boat rental   is undercooked. In Get Out, the terror, the comedy, and the commentary all felt as if they were producing one another. With Us, it s as if Peele is struggling to find a contemporary issue onto which he can overlay his horror movie. (You can t spell  Us  without  U.S.,  and so on.)  Add to this the film s belaboured mise-en-sc ne, which telescopes its themes without anything in the way of subtlety. An opening sequence depicting an 80s-vintage home entertainment console adorned with VHS tapes of C.H.U.D., The Goonies, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and The Man With Two Brains (in which Steve Martin is telepathically linked with a separate brain), serve to twitchily wink at the film s notion of a bifurcated underworld/overworld structure. Such touches might dazzle in their initial density and deliberateness, but they re unlikely to generate much in the way of analysis outside of dopey  20 Things You Might Have Missed In Us  YouTube videos.  These are not the markers of a bad film   or a bad filmmaker   by any stretch. But where Get Out felt urgent and preternaturally confident, Us is the work of a gifted director who seems to be compensating for having less to say by overstating how he says it. Peele knows his horror movie canon well enough to realize that the best cheapo fright flicks are not only scary and fun, but shaggy enough to invite interpretation, instead of issuing preachy messaging about The State Of The World Today.  In place of the hushed voices of his debut (or of Murphy s inciting Delirious joke), you can almost hear Peele goading his audience with Us. It s less  get out  and more  get it? ",MBA_Doc2_Us,MBA,Horror,Positive,Us
152,MBA_Doc3_Us,"Jordan Peele defines his Oscar-winning film, Get Out, as a  social thriller,  and the first of five genre films he plans to make, telling Business Insider,  I ve been working on these premises about these different social demons, these innately human monsters that are woven into the fabric of how we think and how we interact, and each one of my movies is going to be about a different one of these social demons.  Exploiting more jump scares, action, and violence than Get Out, Us effectively expands on the previous film both generically and thematically, combining the zombie, apocalypse, and home-invasion subgenres to produce a socially conscious horror film.  Like many of the most enduring horror films, Peele taps into the return of the repressed. Us dares us to contemplate what lies beneath the  Find Yourself  hall of mirrors (literally represented by a beachside carnival attraction), both psychologically and spatially leading down a rabbit hole of possible interpretations. In the depths below the earth, Peele reveals a prison-like laboratory/dormitory, rendering a space that might be a national  sunken place  the hypnotized state that the protagonist of Get Out fears being sent into, in which the black body is paralyzed, expropriated, and stripped of agency while retaining a frightening consciousness of imprisonment. Us signals its intentions, and possibly a key influence, early on. Overhead shots reminiscent of Kubrick s The Shining introduce the Wilson family before the camera drops down to an image of togetherness: that ubiquitous decal of a stick-figure smiley-face nuclear family on their rear windshield. These figures, hand-in-hand, become a potent symbol in the film, representing much more than just the Wilsons.  We first encounter the family cruising through the mountains, blasting old-school rap ( I Got 5 on It ), heading to Santa Cruz for an annual beach vacation. Howard University grad dad Gabe (Winston Duke) whose glasses make him look like director Jordan Peele, and who is much more of a teddy bear here than as the intimidating M Baku in Black Panther is behind the wheel, surrounded by mother Adelaide (Lupita Nyong o), irritable teenager Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph), and slightly weird but sweetly vulnerable son, Jason (Evan Alex). The Wilsons arrive and meet up with friends and boozy neighbors Josh and Kitty Tyler (Tim Heidecker and Elisabeth Moss) and their mean-girl twin teens and, though the Tylers  new boat opens up a friendly economic rivalry, all signs indicate clear sailing ahead. Adelaide, however, has been haunted by a series of foreboding premonitions, which are soon validated. Later that evening, the power fails, and a family of eerie doppelg ngers, clad in red coveralls, suddenly appears at the Wilsons  vacation house.  Us turns out to be filled with doubles and twins, a gothic perennial of the uncanny that Peele taps into. The double has a long history on screen, with classics indebted to the trope s disquieting powers including not only The Shining and its twins but Vertigo as well. But mirroring is not the only tool that Peele employs to elicit chills in a movie dotted with allusions to both social and film history. The accumulation of carefully placed details, dialogue clues, and cultural references a Black Flag T-shirt nods toward rebellion and anarchy, a set of handcuffs not-so-discreetly toward slavery drives the narrative and provides viewers with pieces to puzzle over long after the lights come up. For horror aficionados, the golf club used as a weapon might bring to mind Michael Haneke s disturbing Funny Games, and a shot of black gloves may evoke a giallo predator. Scissors, a prominent motif in the film s advertising campaign, are a tried-and-true emblem of the genre (and another nod to doubling). Despite the allusions, the film is Peele s own intricately woven, thoughtfully layered, and terrifyingly fun to watch. God as evoked in Jeremiah 11:11, quoted in the movie is in the details.  There is another doubling at work between the genre twins of horror and the musical. Both require a suspension of disbelief and make narrative use of music and choreography. Music and dance are put to dazzling use during the film s climax, in which Nyong o performs a balletic Odette/Odile dance of violence and pursuit of self. All of the actors are terrific and are clearly relishing the challenge of articulating nuances of characterization as they transform over the course of the film into the doubles, who in turn stand in for us, the audience. Newcomer Madison Curry as young Adelaide is, in particular, a standout Peele s highlighting of girls and women as leaders instead of victims is bracing. Considering the nuances of enacting multiple selves made me wonder: are black actors, already burdened by a DuBoisian double consciousness, more versed in portraying layers of characterizations?  Us features beautiful cinematography by Mike Gioulakis, whose credits include the viral (in all the wrong ways) chiller It Follows, and who photographs black skin in rich and scary chiaroscuro, delineating the  real  characters from their doubles. The editing by Nicholas Monsour (a veteran of Key and Peele as well as the goofy gangsta kitten comedy Keanu) is a tour de force, and all the elements of the production work together to create an atmospheric menace that occupies a breathless two-thirds of the high-intensity 116-minute running time. Fortunately, regular doses of humor prevent the pace from becoming overwhelming.  The beginning of the film cryptically references the bizarre 1986 pre social media campaign Hands Across America, in which 6.5 million (North) Americans linked hands, from California to New York City, in a branded and symbolic effort to fight poverty and homelessness. The  80s were a frightening time in many ways, as the long hangover from the  60s gave way to Reagan s reactionary politics, the Chernobyl disaster, the Iran-Contra scandal, and the Christian Coalition. (Possibly in response, the era was also a heyday for the slasher flick.) In Us, that not-so-distant past is prologue, and the echoing image of paper dolls, hand in hand, becomes a major motif and a potent symbol of spatial, generational, and national trauma. Ultimately, the return of the repressed which Peele s film points to lies in the legacies of failed and facile social programs, passed down through the years the underlying horror haunting both the family in Us, and the U.S.",MBA_Doc3_Us,MBA,Horror,Positive,Us
153,MBA_Doc4_Us,"If Get Out wasn t scary enough for you, then Jordan Peele really wants to freak you out with Us.  Us is much more of a conventional horror movie, designed to make you jump in your seat, hold your breath for too long and stare down at your lap to hide from the terrors on screen.  In other words, it s more sensory experience than think-piece.  If Get Out fills us with an existential dread, Us fills us with just your regular kind of dread. The kind of dread that comes from having a lumbering red jumpsuit-decked version of yourself chase you down with some mighty sharp scissors.  Who needs a Ghostface Killer mask when the face the monster wears is the scariest one of all? Yours.  Simply structured in three acts, Us s cold open begins in the mid-80s. A young Adelaide (Madison Curry) is separated from her feuding parents on the Santa Cruz boardwalk.  Wearing a Michael Jackson  Thriller  T-shirt, Adelaide wanders into a deserted funhouse and becomes trapped in the mirror room when the power goes out.  What she sees in the maze of mirrors haunts her to the point that when as an adult (Lupita Nyong o), Adelaide is still deeply uncomfortable when she and her family   husband Gabe Wilson (Winston Duke), daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and son Jason (Evan Alex)   return to the beach during their summer holidays.  Sitting on the beach with their friends Kitty (Elisabeth Moss) and Josh (Tim Heidecker) and their twins (Cali Sheldon and Noelle Sheldon), Adelaide warns they must leave the beach before dark.  That night, back at their holiday house, a family that looks exactly like them, their malevolent doppelgangers, attacks the Wilsons.  The middle act of Us is the most effective, a classic home invasion slasher horror, except when the enemy is a twisted version of yourself, it cuts, literally, that much closer.  Here, Peele s prodigious skill as a director is on full display. These sequences are taut, tense and breathtakingly good.  Even when you re scared, you can t help but notice Peele s striking visuals   they really are beautiful to look at   whether it s the Wilsons walking in a row at the beach, stalked by their shadows on the sand, or a particularly vexing sequence in the final act that we wouldn t dare give away.  Peele is also a master of tone, balancing the horror with comedy, just like he did in Get Out. That is not an easy thing to master, and no one is doing it better than the former one-half of sketch duo Key & Peele.  Honestly, if you ve never seen Winston Duke on a boat before, you re missing out. Or, Elisabeth Moss with a lip gloss tube.  The four leads are crazy good in their dual roles, especially Nyong o who manages to create distinct but connected personalities between Adelaide and her doppelganger Red who skitters around like a cockroach.  The words  Oscar nomination  and  Nyong o  is being thrown about and it s not without merit.  Us is littered with  coincidences  and doubles as a constant reminder there s much more at play than the chase.  Peele has said Us is supposed to question  the fear of the other  and whether the real monsters are ourselves. It s like the funhouse mirrors at the beginning of the film, a potent visual symbol of our own self-image reflected but usually willfully ignored   distorted and grotesque.  Also layered into the movie are thoughts on social inequality, the haves and have-nots and the politics of envy.  The Wilsons are a comfortable, middle class African-American family, but they re not as well-off as their friends Kitty and Josh. At one point, Gabe looks on at Josh s new car with a tinge of green.  But their doppelgangers, called  the tethered , are stratified well below the Wilsons, so it s like we re stuck in this perpetual cycle of consumerism and want. Everyone wants something someone else has and that s part of the reckoning in Us.  The social commentary in Us is not as clear as Get Out, which had one strong central idea it ran with all the way through.  In Us, there are several ideas at play, and it doesn t always form a coherent whole   and the ending may turn everything on its head anyway.  Us is a movie you need to sit with for a while because your feelings and thoughts on it will morph with time and every subsequent conversation.  But it is indeed a worthy follow-up to Get Out, proof that Peele isn t a one-tricker, that he s capable of evolving his creativity and, most importantly, that he can give you one hell of an entertaining and thrilling ride.",MBA_Doc4_Us,MBA,Horror,Positive,Us
154,MBA_Doc5_Us,"After seeing Jordan Peele s new horror film, Us, I wondered if the director had created it as a warning to himself to resist the siren comforts of wealth, fame and his own id after the smashing reception he received for last year s Get Out. Forget the voiceless and pay the price, Us seems to be croaking at its audience.  Allow me to explain: Us is about a middle-class black family, the Wilsons, who go on vacation to California only to find themselves at the center of a revenge plot 30 years in the making. The father, Gabe (Winston Duke), is a big, corny teddy bear of a man who is overcome by an almost pathological need to keep up with the family frenemies, the Tylers. The Tylers, who are white, have a nicer car, a bigger boat and a more modern, better-equipped vacation house. Gabe, much to the chagrin of his wife, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong o), wants to go to the beach to hang out with Josh Tyler (Tim Heidecker) and compare boat notes. Adelaide wants to stay home and read instead of making small talk while Kitty Tyler (Elisabeth Moss) sips her mommy juice. It turns out Adelaide s nervousness is about way more than hanging out with a bickering white couple and their bratty twin daughters.  The Wilsons are soon visited by a family that is a twisted mirror of their own: a husband, a wife and two children, all clad in red jumpsuits and tan leather driving gloves on their right hands. Each of them is equipped with sharp brass shears that are useful for stabbing people and cutting the heads off of rabbits.  It turns out everyone, including the Tylers, have these red-clad doppelg ngers, who refer to themselves as  shadows.  The shadows live underground, tethered to the whims of their sun-basking counterparts. They are a permaclass of the unseen, unheard and unacknowledged, and none of them has the ability to speak   except Red, who communicates with a creaking, disturbed hollowness, as if an animal had chewed halfway through her vocal cords. When Adelaide enjoys a Christmas of gifts, merriment and a hearty dinner, her shadow is forced to dine on raw rabbit. When Adelaide gets married, has sex and gives birth to two children, so too does Red. The shadows are crude copies of humans who experience pain, torture, madness and imprisonment from all the things that give their doubles pleasure.  Sick of their fate, the shadows emerge to conduct a massive, blood-soaked untethering. There are harbingers of disaster everywhere in the film that all point to the same Bible verse, Jeremiah 11:11:  Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.   Us is a jagged allegory for the pitfalls of capitalism and the resentment that mounts when we pretend those whose labor we exploit for our happiness do not exist. As social commentary, it s not as razor-sharp as Get Out. But it still feels like an exceptional accomplishment, mainly because Peele created a role that is a worthy showcase of Nyong o s talent. In Us, Nyong o is the unforgettable two-faced queen come to warn us of what will happen when we keep our own brethren out of sight and out of mind. She makes Red s movements just as studied, precise and creepy as her voice. It is a virtuosic performance and wickedly fun. You get the sense that Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?-era Bette Davis would hate Nyong o if she were her awards season competition, before perhaps warming to her with grudging respect.  Peele has been explicit that Us is not a film about race, and yet it pulls off something that feels transcendent, both because of the unstudied blackness of its cast and because of Peele s commitment to smartening up a genre typically defined by gore, monsters, cheap scares, or all of the above. In the history of the Oscars, only six horror films (The Exorcist, Jaws, Black Swan, The Silence of the Lambs, The Sixth Sense and Get Out) have been nominated for best picture.  In both Get Out and Us, Peele builds on a tradition of black horror as social commentary and pushback against white stereotypes of blackness that extends as far back as Duane Jones  turn as Ben in Night of the Living Dead (1968). Ben, who is actually the hero of the film, ends up getting shot and tossed on a funeral pyre when white rescuers assume he s an enemy. This, after he s spent the movie saving a bunch of white people from marauding ghouls looking to eat live flesh.  Peele delights in playing with tropes and subverting them. In Get Out, the black protagonist actually gets to live. In Us, the white family is deemed inessential to the plot and gets offed by the second act. In Us, the clue to Adelaide s status as a misfit lay in her inability to snap on beat to a rapper s ode to the communal consumption of a dimebag. Later in the movie, that same song gets reinvented with heavy, spooky, sonorous strings, courtesy of composer Michael Abels, who also scored Get Out. He simultaneously celebrates the genre and critiques it. Peele offers something for everyone: winks and Easter eggs for fanboys who consume movies as though they re video games to be figured out, highbrow allegory for those who need more than an imaginary monster to keep them up at night, and now a fantastically twisted antihero played by an Academy Award-winning queen.  Furthermore, he broadens appreciation for the genre. Peele managed to get Oprah Winfrey (who is on record as someone who avoids scary movies) and plenty of others who are horror-averse to not only sit through Get Out but marvel at it and then see it again. He ll likely accomplish something similar with Us. Both are too zeitgeisty to miss.  In the context of horror history, in which films such as King Kong, The Spider and The Creature from the Black Lagoon used monsters as stand-ins for black people, Peele s success feels like a multilayered triumph. It wasn t that long ago that a thoughtful horror film by a black director was pooh-poohed by studio executives for being too ambitious. When Bill Gunn released Ganja & Hess in 1973, in which the need for blood functioned as a metaphor for drug addiction, it was a hit at the Cannes Film Festival. But American film executives were so turned off that it was recut and released as the hackneyed Blood Couple. If you wanted to see Ganja & Hess, it was nearly impossible. The Museum of Modern Art possesses the print.  Almost 50 years later, Peele is getting the recognition that bypassed directors such as Gunn, and he is slashing his own path through Hollywood with remakes of The Twilight Zone and Candyman. He s said repeatedly that Us is about how we are our own worst enemies. Maybe Peele is also thinking about how to avoid becoming his.",MBA_Doc5_Us,MBA,Horror,Positive,Us
155,MBA_Doc6_Us,"Writer-director Jordan Peele s debut feature  Get Out  was one of the most inventive horror movies in years, and so the expectations for his sophomore effort,  Us,  have been running sky-high. It too is a horror film with a light overlay of gallows humor, but it s a more ambitious work than  Get Out.  Despite some extraordinary sequences, it s also a lesser work.  The film opens in 1986 in an amusement park in the oceanside city of Santa Cruz, California. A young girl, Adelaide Wilson (Madeline Curry), wanders off from her parents and enters a seemingly deserted hall of mirrors where she encounters, to traumatizing effect, not only her own reflection but a doppelganger of herself.  Cut to the present day, and Adelaide (Lupita Nyong o) is living what appears to be a comfortably middle-class suburban life with her affable husband, Gabe (Winston Duke), and  two spunky children, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex). When Gabe proposes a summer vacation stayover in Santa Cruz, she balks at the bad memories but reluctantly goes along. Soon enough, bad stuff happens, leading to the film s first true explosion of horror: One night, outside the Wilsons  summer home, a family of red robe-wearing Wilson doppelgangers, clutching razor-sharp scissors, are silently massed in the driveway ready to attack.  As we soon see, the four actors are playing dual roles, themselves and their malevolent doubles. The home invasion is brutal, bloody, and unrelenting. Adelaide s double, who speaks in hoarse, spasmodic, guttural tones, is especially menacing. The murderousness continues as the Wilsons, seeking refuge in the nearby home of vacationing friends, played by Tim Heidecker and Elisabeth Moss, are aghast to discover that they also have been invaded by doppelgangers.  This is one of the few horror movies to feature an African-American family, and, especially given the racial-satirical slant of  Get Out,  we might expect the same slant here. However, Peele is going after bigger allegorical game. But what exactly is the allegory that Peele is pushing? In the 1986 prologue, he makes reference to the Hands Across America benefit event that was intended to raise millions for those who are hungry and homeless. The death-dealing doppelgangers in  Us,  who are soon proliferating everywhere, likewise hold hands. There are several references to a Bible passage in Jeremiah 11:11 with words  I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape.  White rabbits turn up.  Instead of specifically targeting racial animosities, Peele seems to be going after the doubleness of a society in which everyone has their dark side they refuse to acknowledge. Speaking recently to an audience at the South By Southwest film festival, as reported in the Los Angeles Times, he said as much:  On the broader strokes of things, this movie is about this country. And when I decided to write this movie, I was stricken with the fact that we are in a time when we fear the other, whether it is the mysterious invader that we think is going to come and kill us, take our jobs, or the faction that we don t live near that voted a different way than us. We re all about pointing the finger. And I wanted to suggest that maybe the monster we really need to look at has our face.   The problem is, the movie is so chockablock with horror tropes and fright-night symbolism that it often comes across as nothing more than a smorgasbord of scare effects. There s a deeper problem: Peele may think he is slamming all factions for not facing the beast within, but the way he goes after the Wilsons here is especially punitive. Their middle-classness is used against them. He sets a squadron of monsters on them for, it would appear, nothing more flagrant than indulging in materialism and social media. Are we supposed to think that the Wilsons  privilege is won at the expense of the poor and the forgotten? As an allegory, not to mention as a social construct, how does the situation in  Us    as in  United States,  get it?   reflect this country? Ambition in the horror genre can be a good thing, but the overreach in this movie detracts from both the horror and the ambition.  Having said that, Peele shows a marked advance in filmmaking skills here and, in her dual role, Nyong o is ferociously good. Coming as it does after Toni Collette in  Hereditary  and Emily Blunt in  A Quiet Place,  her performance would appear to officially herald a golden age for full-scale performances in a long-derided genre.  Talented as he is, I hope that Peele, who also is behind TV s upcoming  Twilight Zone  reboot, doesn t seek to position himself as the new M. Night Shyamalan, complete with gotcha effects and trapdoor finales. His satiric-horrific take on society, which sporadically breaks through  Us,  is a rare gift. Rarer, perhaps, than he himself realizes.",MBA_Doc6_Us,MBA,Horror,Negative,Us
156,MBA_Doc7_Us,"Get Out was one of the most talked-about and commonly dissected horror films of the decade and it thrust first-time director Jordan Peele firmly into the spotlight. Now, two years later, Peel has answered the  what s next?  question with Us, an uneven film that calls to mind a common pitfall in the movie industry often referred to as the Sophomore Slump. Despite an intriguing premise and a single great sequence, Us is a muddled affair that goes off the rails the more Peele tries to expand, explore, and explain his basic concept. It s often said that less is more in horror and, had Peele cut out a lion s share of the exposition in Us, it would have made for a more viscerally satisfying experience.  Following a creepy prologue set in a Santa Cruz amusement park circa 1986, Us jumps forward in time to  today.  A family of four   father Gabe (Winston Duke), mother Adelaide (Lupita Nyong o), daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph), and son Jason (Evan Alex)   are about to embark on the annual ritual of a summer vacation at the lake. Most of Us  first half-hour is devoted to establishing how normal the Wilsons are. When they arrive at the lake house, Zora complains that she can t get on-line. Gabe buys a cheap boat. Us gets the family-bonding details right; however, this being a horror film, as night follows day, so unpleasantness trails normalcy.  It begins during a power outage with a creepy quartet standing mutely at the end of the driveway, their intentions as hidden by darkness as their countenances. Adelaide is immediately worried but Gabe is more laid-back in his approach. However, when the strangers don t respond to his friendly challenges, he tells his wife to call the police and returns outside brandishing a bat. That s when the home invasion begins   a terrifically crafted 15-minute sequence in which intercutting shows the fate of each member of the Wilson family as the situation unfolds. There s some exposition included here as well   an explanation of why the invaders resemble the victims. They are the  shadows  and they have come with the intention of untethering themselves from their hosts. That can be accomplished only by using scissors. Peele makes sure we don t miss the haves-and-have-nots message here by hammering it home with little attempt at subtlety.  What are you?  asks the affluent black woman of her downtrodden shadow.  We re Americans,  she responds.  The creepiness factor alone keeps the first half of Us involving. Then things start going bonkers and not in a good way. Although never as whacked out as mother!, Us trends in that direction with some plot twists/developments that don t make sense. Logic be damned, however   this movie has metaphors. It s saying something. To make matters worse, Peele doesn t stick to the rules he establishes. After making it clear that the  shadows  are human, he violates that tenet almost immediately. Us embraces horror movie clich s (like the dead not staying dead and supposedly intelligent people doing stupid things) with glee   at times, this seems to be done tongue-in-cheek but not always. There s a fair amount of wit and humor (most of which is intentional) in the proceedings but, outside of the home invasion sequence, there s not enough tension or suspense. Whereas Get Out made viewers feel uncomfortable, the only discomfort emerging from Us is the realization of how little sense everything makes. Putting aside one feeble jump-scare, Peele doesn t seem interested or invested in frightening viewers. He s too busy preaching.  As was the case with Get Out, Peele has stayed away from Big Name Actors in casting Us. Instead, he has reached into the MCU and plucked out Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong o and Winston Duke, both of whom appeared in Black Panther. They re very good here with Nyong o focused on her character s emotional turmoil and Duke providing a portion of the film s comedic relief (along with a few one-liners that come out of the Schwarzenegger school of instant quotables). Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex, who represent the next generation, get their opportunities to wreak havoc.  If there s one thing that saves Us, it s that, even as the movie descends into a narrative morass from which it never escapes, there are many individual scenes that, taken in isolation, pack a punch. The problem is that, once assembled into the larger whole, it doesn t all work. One would have to be forgiving in the extreme to give Peele a pass by using the justification that all horror films are preposterous. Yes, many are, but not this nonsensical. Us is audacious, to be sure, but audacity isn t always a good thing.",MBA_Doc7_Us,MBA,Horror,Negative,Us
157,MBA_Doc8_Us,"It s not ordinary. But certainly not extraordinary. Jordan Peele s follow-up to the box-office-smash Get Out doesn t expand the boundaries of the horror genre like its predecessor or A Quiet Place did. It s almost a retreat into norms that bring to mind humorous horror flicks like Scary Movie, zombie thrillers akin to Dawn of the Dead and over-produced shockers like The Shining. Remember the small, indie feel of Get Out? It s gone. Vanished like a ghost.  The Wilsons, an upper-middle-class family in Northern California, have just settled into their lakeside vacation home. They have arrived, physically and symbolically. Thirtysomething-year-old dad, Gabe (Winston Duke, Black Panther), his tween daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and young son Jason (Evan Alex) all want to go to Santa Cruz Beach. It s got sand, sea, a boardwalk and an amusement park. What s not to like?   Mom, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong o, Twelve Years a Slave), is dead set against the visit. The thought brings back debilitating PTSD. Back in 1986, when she was a kid (Madison Curry) her parents (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Anna Diop) brought her to that same amusement park. She wandered off, got lost in an arcade called Vision Quest, and by the time they found her she was traumatized. So distressed, she couldn t speak and the couple sought therapy for her. A trip to Santa Cruz puts Adelaide in a cold sweat. But her family talks her into it and life is never the same afterwards.   For easy-to-please horror genre fans, who don t ask much from creepy movies, there are enough frights and shocks to satiate: Mirror-image intruders (aka The Tethered), scissors stabbing bodies, blunt force trauma, bodies falling off balconies, boating accidents, heads getting whacked with golf clubs  There are an abundance of thrills. The Wilson family is likable, modern, hip, African American and unapologetically class-conscious. The setting of Northern California and especially the beaches of Santa Cruz are quite inviting.   For discerning fans with a more sophisticated palate, Peele s script is using the doppelganger monsters as a metaphor. They represent the people left behind in the shadows, those who don t get a chance at the good life. The eerie folks from the netherworld who look like the protagonists become a weird head game that is an effective device, initially.  Credit Peele for a very creative and three-dimensional premise. The problem with his ambitious blueprint is that some viewers won t understand what he s after.   The dialogue is cool, especially Gabe s funny asides, but none of it is memorable. The main characters are likable, but not all that exceptional. Neither are their close friends the Tyler family, who act like empty-headed millennials. There is an initial shock when the Wilsons meet the family that trespasses on their property. The astonishment of them seeing themselves is icky at first, but that weird feeling subsides. Soon after, the footage drifts into very standard thriller aspects. Chase scenes, people handcuffed to furniture, combat on boats none of it stretches the imagination.   As action occurs, the cutting back-and-forth between scenes seems a bit clumsy. Sometimes it feels like you re watching a bunch of set pieces and not a group of bone-chilling kinetic sequences that flow with an electric energy. Peele s direction should get tighter, more desperate and exciting as the film progresses. Instead, it remains at a moderate tempo.   Editor Nicholas Monsour has experience with humorous movies (Keanu) and comic TV shows (Cobra Kai). His lack of a background in the horror or thriller genres is evidenced by his non-rhythmic pacing. Even as the film builds to its conclusion, the speed of action and length of scenes stays the same. No sense of real urgency arrives. Nada.  There are some plot holes: If Adelaide was so traumatized by Santa Cruz Beach, why does she go back?  And if she s going to return, and is really scared, why would she let her young son out of her sight? When you get to the end of the movie and figure out the game that is being played, her actions make even less sense. Sometimes the characters make irrational decisions and do stupid stuff.  The slow pacing leaves some dead time when the camera (Michael Gioulakis, Glass) languishes on the countryside and the musical score (Michael Abels, Get Out) blares with loud string music. That s when the film feels like the over-stuffed The Shining, heavy on the big buildup and shoddy on the action. The real people wear contemporary costumes that are fitting (costume design by Kym Barrett, The Matrix). The faux folks are stuck in dull red jumpsuits.  The film s prologue mentions thousands of tunnels that run underground in the U.S., like there is a dingy underworld. At the hands and imagination of production designer Ruth De Jong (Manchester by the Sea) the tunnels look like porcelain walls in a fancy spa lobby. The spaces off the halls look like poorly lit high school classrooms. Audiences expecting something dark and sinister like a decayed subway tunnel (e.g. the  L  line in New York City) won t find one.   The Wilsons are as all-American as the family on TV s Blackish, minus the biting humor. Racial issues are not brought up, it s not that kind of party. Lupita Nyong o is a vision as the two moms. Smooth skin, gorgeous lips. She s is earnest in a very complicated role, especially as Red the demon shadow. Winston Duke is amicable as the dad who has trouble defending his family. Duke plays the father like he s Jordan Peele s alter ego. Elisabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker as the heads of the Tyler household don t get a real chance to fly. The extras who play zombie-types in the tunnel couldn t frighten a flea.   A beach bum in Santa Cruz holds a sign that reads: Jeremiah 11:11. The verse proclaims:  Therefore, this is what the LORD says: I am going to bring calamity upon them, and they will not escape. Though they beg for mercy, I will not listen to their cries.    Us never reaches that over-the-edge crescendo into total mayhem that scares you to death and makes a good horror film a great one. ",MBA_Doc8_Us,MBA,Horror,Negative,Us
158,MBA_Doc9_Us,"Writer-director Jordan Peele s 2017 Get Out was a brash and intriguing debut, a picture that wrestled with the notion of whether or not America can ever be a post-racial society: Vital and spooky, it refused to hand over easy answers. With the ambitious home-invasion horror chiller Us, Peele goes even deeper into the conflicted territory of class and race and privilege; he also ponders the traits that make us most human. But this time, he s got so many ideas he can barely corral them, let alone connect them. He overthinks himself into a corner, and we re stuck there with him. Lupita Nyong o stars as Adelaide, who has overcome a traumatic childhood experience and now has a family of her own, including husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and two kids: graceful, well-adjusted Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and the slightly more awkward Jason (Evan Alex), who wears a wolfman mask pushed up on his head as a kind of security blanket. We meet the comfortably middle-class Wilson family as they re heading off on vacation to Santa Cruz, the site of Adelaide s childhood ordeal. On their first night away, they look out and see a family of four, mute and stony echoes of themselves, standing in the driveway. From there, Peele unspools a story of  shadow  people, long forced to live underground but now streaming to the Earth s surface to claim, violently, what they feel is rightfully theirs. The effectiveness of Us may depend on how little you know about it going in, so the spoiler-averse may wish to stop reading here. But it s impossible to address any of the movie s larger ideas without giving away key plot points: Before long, that shadow family has infiltrated the house, and now that we can get a good look, we see that each of them is a not-quite-right replica of a Wilson, dressed in a red jumpsuit and wielding a pair of menacing-looking shears. At one point a terrified Adelaide asks the other mother, a twin of herself but with vacant, crazy eyes and a demented smile,  What are you people?   We are Americans,  the lookalike responds, in a whispery growl. That s a bright, neon-lit Author s Message if ever there was one, though the idea of using a group of sunlight-deprived semi-zombies as a metaphorical element in a parable about class complacency isn t necessarily a bad one. Are you and your family doing great? Do you live in a nice place, drive an expensive car, and have plenty of food for everyone to eat? Be grateful for it. But be aware that there are others who, through no fault of their own, don t live at the same comfort level or are, in fact, barely surviving. (The Wilsons also have close friends, Josh and Kitty, played by Tim Heidecker and Elisabeth Moss, who have more money and nicer stuff than they do, a source of irritation for Gabe in particular, and another of the movie s threads about class consciousness in America.) But Peele doesn t always lay out his ideas clearly. Us isn t always fun to watch; there are stretches where it s plodding and dour. He s overly fond of heavy-duty references, including Biblical ones: A creepy dude holds a sign that reads Jeremiah 11:11. (If you don t know it outright, it s the one that goes,  Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them. ) The mood of Us is sometimes chilling, but even then, you re not always sure what, exactly, is chilling you. Maybe it s just the feeling of being trapped in an over-air-conditioned lecture hall, because there s a strain of preachiness running through the whole thing. One thing that s unquestionable: Peele is a dazzling visual stylist. (Peele s cinematographer is Mike Gioulakis, who also shot David Robert Mitchell s It Follows, as well as M. Night Shyamalan s Split and Glass.) The movie s opening, which details young Adelaide s nightmare it takes place in a ghoulish hall of mirrors on the Santa Cruz boardwalk is a mini-horror masterpiece by itself, an evocation of the outright weirdness of childhood rather than its wonder: As the girl wanders away from her parents, in an almost trancelike state, she clutches a candied apple so shiny it s like blood-red crystal ball and puts us in a trance, too. Yet the rest of Us is laden with metaphors, and they pile up so quickly that not even Peele can keep up with them. The movie repeatedly references Hands Across America, a 1986 benefit event in which some 6.5 million people joined hands along a route mapped out across the contiguous United States. (Many participants had donated $10 to reserve a space in the chain; the money was donated to local charities dedicated to fighting hunger and ending poverty.) In Us, the shadow people form a similar chain. But it s hard to know what Peele is trying to say with that image. Are the semi-zombies of Us just less fortunate versions of us? Are they actually us and we don t know it? Is their clumsy anger somehow superior to thought and reason? After all, it has unified them, while we aboveground humans are more divided than ever. How, in the end, are we supposed to feel about these shadow people, for so long deprived of basic human rights including daylight that they have become murderous clones? Sometimes great movies are ambiguous, but ambiguity resulting from unclear thinking makes nothing great. It s one thing for a movie to humble you by leaving you unsure about yourself and your place in the world; it s another for it to leave you wondering what, exactly, a filmmaker is trying to use his formidable verbal and visual vocabulary to say.",MBA_Doc9_Us,MBA,Horror,Negative,Us
159,MBA_Doc10_Us,"Writer-director Jordan Peele rose to fame as half of the comedy team Key and Peele and his breakout hit Get Out was as much satire as horror, not least in its clarity of purpose.  While the macabre underpinnings of the meet-the-parents premise took time to emerge, it was plain right away that Peele was making a statement about racism from an African-American perspective, mocking the hypocrisy of white liberals in particular.  Perhaps Peele wound up feeling Get Out was too neat and tidy for its own good   and too easily embraced by the very people he had set out to critique. His follow-up, Us, is similar in its allegorical approach, yet also a change of pace: murkier, harder to digest and less likely to be nominated for multiple Oscars.  Best to pause here if you don't want spoilers. The story follows an ordinary middle-class family   doofus dad Gabe (Winston Duke), high-strung mother Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) plus children Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex)   on holiday to Santa Cruz.  After dark, Gabe and Adelaide spy a second family of four lurking in their driveway, wearing baggy red jumpsuits and standing in a row with hands linked like living paper dolls.  Where these figures came from and why is a mystery, but their immediate, murderous aims are all too clear. The battle is on to survive through the night, with terror multiplying once it's discovered the newcomers are exact physical duplicates of their intended victims.  Dopplegangers, clones and shadow selves have been everywhere in popular culture for the past few years, yet Peele's use of the trope is initially puzzling. More is going on, evidently, than the stock suggestion that each of us has a hidden dark side.  For an unsettling few minutes it's possible to wonder if he's drawing on the worst kind of white supremacist fantasy for his own purposes, forcing the members of this black family to confront  themselves  as they might appear in the imagination of paranoid racists. But that doesn't seem to be it, quite, because Gabe and Adelaide's white friends Kitty and Josh (Elizabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker), who are staying nearby, turn out to have their own, equally vicious doubles.  If Us isn't about race in the clear-cut way that Get Out was, it also isn't not about race   especially since the mythology underlying the action proves to be centered on the concept of  tethering , a metaphor that all but explicitly harks back to the days of slavery.  In truth, Us strikes me as what scholars sometimes call an  incoherent text , at once over-specific and frustratingly vague. Clues are scattered throughout that ask us to look for some deep, hidden meaning   starting with the row of 1980s VHS tapes visible at the start of the film's prologue, from The Goonies to The Man With Two Brains.  Yet a good portion of the film functions in practice like the kind of stalk-and-slash thriller that has been made a zillion times before, often with more finesse.  Peele's main visual strategy is to place the camera slightly closer to the actors' faces than feels comfortable, while the wide-screen format leaves room for us to seek out suggestive details in the background. This is effective at points, but can easily feel clumsy and overbearing.  Likewise, the script shows little of the tonal control of Get Out. The touches of comic relief are often ill-judged, undermining whatever belief we might have in the reality of the story.  Not once but twice, the chief villain takes time out to deliver a lengthy monologue   less because this makes sense for the character than because Peele hasn't found a better way to explain what's going on.  And yet the film, for all its unevenness and confusion, cannot be dismissed. Something genuinely urgent seems to be happening, especially in the performances by Nyong'o and, to a lesser extent, Moss (whose role in The Handmaid's Tale is yet another reference point)  That there's room for more than one interpretation is no bad thing in itself. The notion of a long-suppressed force rising up from below might well resonate with many types of audiences, however they understand it and whether they welcome or fear the unrest to come.",MBA_Doc10_Us,MBA,Horror,Negative,Us
80,CBS_Doc1_MinorityReport,"Since my early teens I ve been stubbornly clinging to a copy of the October 1953 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction magazine, featuring the first installment of Isaac Asimov s The Caves of Steel, a mystery story set in a vast city of the future. I prize this particular issue not for anything inside but for the cover illustration by  Emsh,  the name future filmmaker Ed Emshwiller used to sign his artwork. In the foreground two transparent hands one revealing human bones, the other metal ones are shown in front of the vast reaches of an enclosed cityscape with pedestrians. This encouraged me to consider not only a future city but also how it might look to both a human and a robot detective.  No story, by Asimov or anyone else, could do as much for my imagination as that Emsh cover. The only thing that came close was a single sentence by Damon Knight in his review of Asimov s novel, which may have been what led me to the novel and that issue of Galaxy in the first place:  Asimov has turned a clear, ironic, and compassionate eye on every cranny of the City: the games children play on the moving streets; the legends that have grown up about deserted corridors; the customs and taboos in Section kitchens and men s rooms; the very feel, smell, and texture of those steel caves in which men live and die.  This helped me imagine a future city, though unlike the Emsh cover or A.I. Artificial Intelligence, it taught me nothing about what it might be like to be a robot.  I became an SF fan because of such invitations to dream about the future, immense spaces, and one s own origins. Early SF movies like Metropolis (1926) offered all these invitations, and their poetics were later elaborated on by films such as Blade Runner (1982), which borrowed from other diverse sources, including neonoir and Shanghai Express. Less poetic evocations of otherworldly climes, like the original Star Wars, can also create some of this magic provided their visions are fleeting, on-screen just long enough to tease the imagination; as in soft-core-porn bubble dances, the secret is not to show too much. (The Emsh Galaxy cover may show a lot of one cityscape, but it only suggests a narrative, leaving that mainly to the viewer.)  The parallel with porn is more apparent when one reflects that most futuristic, gadget-ridden science fiction is selling something that has more to do with the present than the future:  investing in the future  is mostly about buying now, and the hype about  experiencing the future  through the latest technology is an invitation to dig into our pockets today. Maybe that s why most SF veers more toward the right than the left because it s usually selling not the fancy trappings but the status quo.   Minority Report, Steven Spielberg s enjoyable new thriller set in Washington, D.C., in 2054 full of more alluring gadgets than you can shake a stick at performs its own bubble dance, for good and ill. Derived from a Philip K. Dick story that s more about action than nuanced commentary, it doesn t have a vision that incorporates a poetics but functions as a grand entertainment; part of its central plan is to always give you more to look at than you can possibly take in. Some of my colleagues have been calling it a thinking person s action movie, but the drive of its narrative and the heft of its visuals don t give you much time to think basically you re reduced to gawking and following.  Minority Report does offer a few issues to ponder, and given the mindlessness of most summer action specials, it s something of an intellectual feast, even if it s all hors d oeuvres. Yet alongside last summer s A.I., which had the benefit of Stanley Kubrick s intellect, Minority Report has mainly the illusion of thought. (To Spielberg s credit, both as a filmmaker and as a thinker, he noted recently that when he saw the kind of hostile reviews A.I. was getting, he realized he must have done something right because all of Kubrick s own pictures since 2001: A Space Odyssey got the same sort of critical response.)  At the very least, Minority Report is crammed with details that are not so much ideas as the seeds (or sometimes the pits) of ideas. Like me, Spielberg grew up on Mad when it was still a comic book, and the hallmark of its 50s pictorial style, which he was already emulating two decades ago in 1941, is to stuff wisecracks into the edges of the frames; here he does the same thing with modules of future-think furnished by a team of experts he and his staff organized. Yet some of these modules work less as ideas than as mechanisms designed to shove us forward; the  minority report  itself, which figured significantly in the Dick story, functions here mainly as one more red herring.   Sustained thought is discouraged here by the characters, situations, and premises however serviceable they are in other respects. Let s start with the last of these: the notion of a  precrime  police bureau that predicts future murders in order to abort them. The most alluring thing about this notion is said to be the way it anticipates today s headlines the post-September 11 strategy whereby we give up some of our freedom and privacy in exchange for an assurance that future disasters will be averted. Since no such assurance can be given honestly, the value of losing some of our freedom and privacy remains to be demonstrated (at least to the American public, if not to those who ve contrived to take these things away from us). The pitch behind such an exchange is actually a simplistic formula designed to give only the impression of thought.   This isn t to say that Minority Report espouses having a special bureau to predict crimes (or disasters); in fact, it implies that there might be a price to pay for such meddling. Yet insofar as its bureau depends on the exploitation of three mutants, whose predictions can be recorded and played back like movies, its view of the future is neither utopian nor dystopian but a vaguely formulated conflation of the two. (If Spielberg as SF auteur has any single preoccupation, it s cinema itself as an all-purpose agent, instrument, and metaphor.)  A philosophical conundrum is introduced in the film whereby people can t necessarily be considered guilty of crimes they re prevented from committing and free will becomes a bit like flesh in a bubble dance now you see it, now you don t. But the conundrum is more a ruse for keeping the story moving than a philosophical or moral proposition that s explored with any coherence. At one point we see hundreds of  criminals  whose crimes have been aborted stashed away in a high-tech prison like corpses in a cemetery, but the movie doesn t encourage us to think about these prisoners as people the high-tech equipment encasing them is infinitely more interesting any more than our government encourages us to think much about the indeterminate number of terrorist suspects it s now detaining indefinitely. In the news, as in action movies, simple, fast-moving narratives with clearly marked good guys and bad guys are what s needed and slowing things down long enough to allow us to notice the extras can only be a needless distraction.  I guess what I m trying to say is that narrative momentum and this movie has plenty of it ultimately serves salesmanship of one kind or another more than analysis. Of course there s nothing necessarily wrong with this, at least in the realm of entertainment I was as elated and as absorbed by the rush of events and images as anyone. But don t be conned into thinking that some sort of serious, thoughtful statement is being delivered along with the roller-coaster ride.  The characters in Minority Report are more developed than the pasteboard figures in the Dick story, though only in the sense that they have more detailed back stories all of which are unfortunately standard issue and stripped for action. Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise, whose production company made the film) is a drug addict mourning the mysterious loss of his son six years before. This tragedy is used so glibly and mechanically to explain the end of his marriage and his interest in precrime that it isn t so much motivation as a ploy to prevent our asking about his motives. His estranged wife, Lara (Kathryn Morris), is even less of a character. Unlike many of Asimov s characters and the hero of A.I., these people aren t robots, but they might as well be. (What makes Anderton  human  is his grief over his missing son and his desire for vengeance, two movie staples; otherwise he s a zero.) That the mutants predict Anderton will commit a murder of his own adds plenty of plot interest but nothing at all to his character. To an even greater extent, Anderton s mentor (Max von Sydow) and his antagonist from the FBI (Colin Farrell) don t exist apart from their plot functions. This isn t to deny that the plot is full of neat and ingenious twists, only that these stunts aren t worth dwelling on not only because they shouldn t be spoiled, but also because they can t be taken very seriously.  Character in the old-fashioned sense is distributed much more liberally to character actors in character parts: a prison guard who performs Bach (Tim Blake Nelson), a sadistic mad-scientist surgeon with an archetypally grotesque assistant (Peter Stormare and Caroline Lagerfelt), and the biggest scenery chewer of all, a greenhouse scientist named Dr. Iris Hineman (Lois Smith the same actress, I was astonished to recall, who played a whorehouse madam s callow young assistant in East of Eden 48 years ago), who s accorded one scene in order to give us some vital exposition. All of these characters are colorful but so clearly labeled as such that, through no fault of the actors, they wind up having certain robotic tendencies. (They re obviously built to serve the filmmaking and storytelling machinery, yet the fact that they re programmed like us isn t part of the plot or theme, as it is in A.I.)   More impressive is Samantha Morton as Agatha, the most powerful of the three mutants a religious icon clearly designed to suggest Stanley Kubrick s Star Child in 2001 and Carl Dreyer s Renee Falconetti in The Passion of Joan of Arc, but also a striking figure in her own right who doesn t depend entirely on those references. However, she like her mutant partners, Arthur and Dashiell is named after a classic mystery writer. (Guess who.) Her name like the credited clip from Rouben Mamoulian s The Mark of Zorro and the uncredited clip from Samuel Fuller s House of Bamboo playing on the wall of the surgeon s lair and the bits of Schubert s Unfinished Symphony heard in the precrime bureau while Anderton or his antagonist pull together precrime clips with grandiloquent gestures is there to provoke our recognition not of the future or even of the past, but of the media-savvy present.  It s Spielberg s peculiar genius that he thrives on delivering a surfeit of emotional and visceral kicks, sometimes to the point of making us feel as if we re chasing breathlessly after a circus, and there were times to stretch the metaphor a bit when I wanted to concentrate more on single acts than on all three circus rings at once. As much as I enjoyed Smith s performance, I resented her cavorting, digitally hyperactive plants inventiveness run amok for competing with her own grandstanding and not functioning simply as comic props. Similarly, the use of showbiz standbys can be mildly insulting: the implausible gross-out gags of a temporarily blinded Anderton scarfing down one disgusting-looking dish or drink after another from the surgeon s moldy refrigerator evoked the money shot of dinosaur shit in Jurassic Park, making me feel that Spielberg was manipulating my responses with the same excessive, proprietary glee his honcho figures show manipulating their precrime clips.  And what about the world these characters are planted inside? It s divided between filthy alleys and flophouses on the one hand and awesomely spiffy malls, buildings, and roadways on the other, but this division seems to derive more from set-decorating schemes than from any sort of social speculation or insight. Perhaps we re supposed to be so impressed by the overhead camera movement tracing the paths taken by mechanical spiders through the rooms of a flophouse that we won t notice that the flophouse has no relation to any sort of genuine destitution, past, present, or future. Like the kettledrums heard behind the opening credits, these rooms are designed to put us in a Blade Runner frame of mind albeit a cozier one and not to offer any commentary on the world we live in.  Blade Runner kept a sense of social observation amid all of its design references, but this movie is content to deck out its Blade Runner and various noir milieus with a lot of stray (if striking) technological details. And even if we re meant to walk away from Minority Report with a certain skepticism about overly eager crime prevention, that doesn t mean we re supposed to reflect on this movie s methods of control and coercion, as we were in A.I. Minority Report isn t so much a statement as it is a box of toys, some of which are labeled  dark  or  thoughtful  to add to the fun. ",CBS_Doc1_MinorityReport,CBS,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority Report
81,CBS_Doc2_MinorityReport,"Steven Spielberg s Minority Report realizes the full potential of author Philip K. Dick s science-fiction worldview, a perspective filled with dangerous technology, feverish paranoia, and metaphysical philosophies. Spielberg s complicated, wonderfully stylized approach uses Dick s 1956 short story of the same name as a launching pad. While it captures the author s vision of an imperfect future and the perilous reality that dwells under the alluring surface of futurism, the picture also stands as Spielberg s most extraordinary exhibit of pure filmmaking. Minority Report augments and expands on the source material, concentrating Dick s obsessions about the potential dangers of technology and the author s ongoing existential battle between free will and determinism, especially in regard to the manipulation of time, such as time travel or precognition. Over more than forty novels and several short story collections, Dick s work permeates a sense of fascination and suspicion toward the future. The fascinating prospect of new technologies, exploration of new frontiers, and humanity s evolutionary progression of extra-sensory perceptions consume his output. And yet, he always investigates their inevitable downfalls. His stories feature characters hindered by supposed advancements, thrown into the central conflict by a set of circumstances put into motion by unsound developments. In that tradition, Spielberg s film is a nonstop chase, at once a thriller of epic escapist and intellectual bravado. It amalgamates Hitchcockian suspense, elements of film noir, and Dick s vision of the future, three of the most distinctive and inventive of all storytelling styles, into a single source, resulting in a masterful triumph from a masterful filmmaker.  Set in the near-future, Minority Report introduces the concept of Precrime, Washington D.C. s exploration into a revolutionary form of law enforcement. Founded by Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow) and headed by Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise), Precrime utilizes the  gifts  of the Precogs, three clairvoyants who have given up their freedom to support the cause of detecting crimes before they occur. The Precogs  foreseen visions are analyzed by the Precrime unit and verified by a council of judges; a positive mark is identified, and suddenly officers race to prevent a crime from taking place. Impending perpetrators are caught and then booked before ever committing an offense. When the film opens, there hasn t been a murder in the District of Columbia for six years; the existence of Precrime alone virtually eliminates the consideration of murder, so only crimes of passion remain. Though dedicated to the ideology of Precrime, Anderton s personal life is in shambles. Long ago, his young son disappeared at a public pool; now a divorc , he whiffs neural drugs to escape the guilt and painful memories of his former life. On the job, however, he remains professional and composed. In the opening scenes, Justice Department representative Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) enters the Precrime offices to audit the program for national expansion and meets Anderton, who jealously protects the system he helped build. Witwer s insistence that a human component will ultimately threaten the countrywide growth of Precrime quickly proves true after the Precogs predict that Anderton will commit a murder. Anderton has no plans to kill anyone, nor does he recognize the foretold victim, someone named Leo Crow. But knowing the efficient and absolute manner in which Precrime officers detain their would-be perps, Anderton has no choice but to run and attempt to prove his innocence on the lam.  minority-report-5Established within these first scenes are all the elements of a wrong-man thriller, drawn from the institution of Alfred Hitchcock s cinema. Titles like The 39 Steps and Saboteur begin with the false charge of murder, the yarn unraveling as the protagonist does the impossible to prove their innocence. These are spellbinding stories that contain an immediate suspense given the nature of the plot. Spielberg takes every advantage of that, employing Hitchcockian tropes in the film s high-tech setting. While following Anderton s flight from justice, the director uses the chase to explore the film s ultramodern environment, showcasing a range of technology and equipment, but never slowing his pace to artificially linger on the background details more than the immediate wrong-man scenario. Hitchcock did the same, making his environments entirely functional within their scenes, though distinctive in their selection. North by Northwest, for example, uses Mount Rushmore, an emblematic and immediately identifiable landmark for its rousing finale, the characters dodging bullets and hanging on for dear life by the edges of the monument s massive sculpted faces. And yet, the heads of those former presidents are never more interesting than Cary Grant. Minority Report s screenplay, written by Scott Frank and Jon Coen, scatters an array of multihued characters into the futuristic milieu, the most diverse of them appropriately being John Anderton. Peter Stomare plays a vengeful doctor with a nasty cold; Tim Blake Nelson is the Precrime prison s wheelchair-bound containment sentry; Daniel London as the clingy babysitter of the Precogs in their floating nutrient pool; Lois Smith is the pessimistic, sharp-witted mother of Precrime. Cruise, however, renders the performance of his career as Anderton. His intensity and dimensionality make the story not merely one of watching as special-effects instill marvel, but one fully grounded in the motivation of the character, the importance of the chase, the pain of his tragic background, and his pursuit of answers to a crucial mystery.  When Anderton decides to flee, a series of events perfectly ingrained into the future world of the film build to a matchless chase sequence, compiling twenty or so of the most exhilarating minutes in all of cinema. Inside his magnetically propelled car which rides on automated tracks, Anderton speaks to Burgess in a frenzied attempt to determine why he would murder this man named Leo Crow. As Precrime takes control of Anderton s vehicle remotely, he carhops on a vertical highway and eventually makes his way to the subway. Eye scanners that track oncoming passengers via retinal charting help Precrime officers meet Anderton on the platform at the next stop; on jetpacks they pursue him into an alleyway where, when cornered, Anderton attacks, zapping his former colleagues with their own  sick sticks.  After commandeering a jetpack for himself, he flies through an apartment complex, escaping into an industrial district. The chase ends in an automated car factory, amid mechanical parts flashing sparks and robot assembly lines busying themselves. The officers on Anderton s tail wield energy force  concussion guns,  blasting boxes and each other without harming surfaces. Witwer arrives on scene and he and Anderton engage in fisticuffs. Our hero drops from a moving platform onto the assembly line, into the framework of an unfinished vehicle. Automaton arms install pieces of the vehicle around him, Anderton barely evading part after part during the car s assembly. His pursuers watch from a distance as the vehicle comes together, their perpetrator nowhere to be seen, possibly crushed inside the car being built around him. The car moves off the factory line, its construction finished; then Anderton sits up in the driver s seat, unharmed. In one motion from the assembly line to speeding away to freedom, Anderton s escape is complete.  minority-report-1Spielberg envisaged the car factory sequence from a concept originally envisioned by Hitchcock for North by Northwest. The Master of Suspense wanted Cary Grant s character, Roger O. Thornhill, to find himself in a Detroit automobile factory. As Thornhill walked and talked with an informant, the audience would have witnessed a car in the background being built on the factory line through a single tracking shot. Alas, Hitchcock and his writer Ernest Lehman could not conceive a reason to place Thornhill in Detroit, so the proposal was scrapped. Spielberg adapted it for Minority Report, using a piece of unproduced film history to directly acknowledge his picture as an ode to Hitchcockian devices. Another Minority Report scene features Anderton escaping into the rain with an umbrella, a Precog, Agatha (Samantha Morton), guiding him to freedom by forecasting every move he should make to elude his pursuers. As Precrime officers pursue him on a higher level, they look down to see a crowd of pedestrians all with umbrellas and Anderton, umbrella overhead, lost in the throng, the scene a direct parallel of one in Hitchcock s Foreign Correspondent. But more than a particular scene or two, Minority Report borrows the raw cinematic essence of Hitchcock thrillers the atmosphere of tension combined with a pitch of pure, joyful entertainment. The momentum, from the nonstop crescendo of thrills throughout to the very public and quickly resolved finale, mirrors that of films like North by Northwest and Saboteur, and a dozen other Hitchcock pictures. The tone is serious while also allowing for humor, and the suspense never loses its potency. Spielberg uses Hitchcockian bird s eye camera angles, long zooms, and sets his story to a rousing score by John Williams worthy of Bernard Herrmann, without losing his own directorial flourishes. And he accomplishes all this without feeling derivative; indeed, moviegoers not intimately familiar with Hitchcock s oeuvre will miss the reverence hidden in plain sight onscreen.  What Spielberg does differently than Hitchcock is turn his central plot device, or MacGuffin, into a critical philosophical tool for the entire film, versus the frivolous and pointless item Hitchcock s MacGuffin usually proves to be. Hitchcock used microfilm or diamonds or cold hard cash, whereas the MacGuffin in Minority Report proves to be the eponymous file saved in the Precog s brain. The three Precogs (Agatha, Dashiell, and Arthur, named after three writers you may have heard of) work as a hive mind, but the most gifted of them, Agatha, occasionally sees something different than the other two. Agatha s  minority report  suggests that the Precogs  vision will not necessarily occur the way they have communally predicted. For the integrity of Precrime, Burgess ordered that these reports be destroyed, though a copy remains stored away in Agatha s unconscious. When Anderton learns of this, he sets out to find his minority report, if one exists, and expose his probable innocence. But before ever approaching the futuristic megalopolis wherein Precrime and ultimately his innocence reside, he prepares himself. Knowing that no matter how stealthy he may be, retinal scanners will identify him before ever reaching the city, Anderton arranges for an eye transplant in the criminal underground. He enters The Sprawl, a dodgy part of town both dark and enclosed, where Spielberg mutates his thriller with a film noir interlude. Projected on the room s dank wall is a scene from Samuel Fuller s gritty noir classic The House of Bamboo (a scene which Spielberg later uses to mirror Witwer s death), an homage that also nods to the noirish manner of these scenes. A mad doctor performs Anderton s procedure, leaving his eyes bandaged for a mandatory 12-hour recovery, his only comfort being some rotten chow in the fridge should he get hungry. Shadows fill the room, ceiling fans keep the space active, and neurological drugs pass the time. In the scenes prior to and after this sequence, the film contains a blue-gray sheen. Frequent Spielberg cinematographer Janusz Kaminski over-lights the bright future, bleach-bypassing them in post-production to retain a metallic utopian polish. But in The Sprawl there is only darkness interrupted by high contrast lighting.  minority-report-2Driven into hiding by state-of-the-art policing technologies, Anderton must leave The Sprawl when technology seeks him out. A patrol moves from building to building in search of their fugitive, dropping  spiders  to scout out and scan residents. These self-guided, metallic gizmos scurry into homes for mandatory retinal identification; however, Anderton s eyes need more time to heal from his surgery. Opening them now could leave him blind, and so he submerges himself in ice water to block the spiders  infra-red sight. The spiders move from room to room, as Spielberg shows us in a skillful overhead sequence, filmed using an amazing set piece with precise camera movements that capture the residents through broken light panels and shabby ceiling tiles. The robotic hunters locate Anderton, hearing the smallest sound, but they scan only the counterfeit identity he paid for. What absorbing ideas these are for a world of plausible ingenuity. Part of Minority Report s appeal is reveling in the superior technologies; headhunting spiderbots and magnetic cars and retinal scanners take a foreground role, but production designer Alex McDowell (Fight Club) imparts every scene with something imaginative and new. While many of the wonders therein originated in Philip K. Dick s body of work, the better part of the film s futuristic gear was conceived by some of today s top minds. In 1999, two years prior to filming, Spielberg arranged a conference between fifteen specialists from various scholarly branches to assist in devising a believable, relevant futureworld. Representatives from the fields of architecture, biomedical research, physics, transportation, and modern fiction gave their input and helped boost the environment of the film, lending the configuration behind the film s distinctive look, while also conceiving those clever details that make the world a believable tomorrow.  Spielberg renders the film s technology through a seamless blend of computer-generated images and physical creations, being a filmmaker who knows how to craft the fantastical into reality. Be it dinosaurs, wondrous UFOs, or lost biblical artifacts, the director s ability to make the impossible seem real is unmatched. As a result, Spielberg s mise-en-sc ne feels credible, more so than comparable science-fiction settings. The futurist aspects of the film were designed to be integrated with contemporary architecture, as if the environment had been built upon again and again through generations of advancement. The practicality of this filmic world and its believable consumer products have such a tangible sense of possibility that modern scientists have begun building what movie special-effects wizards created for the film. 3-D holograms, with which Anderton views home videos of his wife and son, appeared on CNN during the 2008 presidential election. NEC Corporation unveiled a camera in Japan that detects age and sex, formatting nearby advertisements to fit the photographed audience, similar to the retinal scanners in the film. And a number of companies have used Minority Report as inspiration to make touch-screens (like the iPad) and gestural interfaces (Xbox s Kinect) a reality, drawing from the scenes where Anderton disassembles the seemingly random images from the Precog vision by tossing them about a clear, free-floating computer console. And when Minority Report isn t shaping our real-life world, its influence is felt on countless other films, including virtually every subsequent sci-fi effort Michael Bay s The Island, Marvel s Iron Man, J.J. Abrams  Star Trek, and the list goes on.  minority-report-3The film s technology is never included superfluously. Each piece makes a comment on the scene or the vast future envisioned within the film, fully embedding them into the moment organically, always in service of the story s unrelenting momentum. Consider the intrusive advertising, compelled by retinal scanners that read Anderton s identity and try to sell him everything from beer to cars, or chart when he gets on the subway. Reading the retina, they flash across the eye to capture an identity, logging the information, location, and patterns into a stored database. Shown as a security measure early in the film, the scanner turns into a dangerous trap when Anderton is a fugitive, as the police connect to the scanning database to help find their man. Although the presence of in-film advertisements undoubtedly served needed product placements (most prominently Lexus, Pepsi, and Gap) and therein financing for the $102 million dollar production, the film itself integrates the technology of advertising scans into the thriller scenario, and the presence of the scanners and ads shifts dramatically, transforming into an invasion of privacy and an obstacle Anderton must overcome. Empathizing with the wrong-man hero, the viewer now sees the scanner less as a device to follow shopping habits and more of a tool to retain order. And because of this, Anderton goes to the extreme of transplanting his eyes with that of a non-criminal to escape the scanners  constant presence. In another of Minority Report influences on modern culture, the seemingly futurist 2002 film predicted the outgrowth of invasive ads in metropolitan centers such as Times Square or downtown Tokyo.  Set aside the suspense of this extended sequence of events, if possible, and instead reflect on what each technological detail tells the audience about the world of Minority Report. The magnetic car suggests this future offers an environmentally friendly solution to transportation, but that the driver has no control over their vehicle should an emergency arise. The eye scanners alert police to dangerous persons on the subway, making one of the most typically dangerous forms of public transportation worry free. Indeed, these conveniences make life easier, but they also grant a near absolute authority to the nonlethal police. The jetpack, Spielberg s nod to the escapist sci-fi serials of yesteryear, remains the most implausible piece of technology in the film; though Spielberg acknowledges as much when Anderton spins his teammate opponents out of control. The technology reveals the utopia of Minority Report to be a dystopia in disguise. In Blade Runner, another Philip K. Dick adaptation, director Ridley Scott made the decomposition of his future landscape apparent in every frame, the putrefaction of the setting undeniable. Spielberg, conversely, aligns the conditions with the story. In the opening scenes, the District of Columbia gleans from its perfection, its rightness and spectacle soon to be expanded across the country when Precime is approved for national expansion. When Anderton wields technology in his favor, Spielberg treats it as an extraordinary spectacle. But when the hunter becomes the hunted, every tool at his disposal twists into a dangerous villain, frightening and impossible to counteract. Only through Anderton s desperate humanity can he fight it. A futurology such as Dick s admires how beneficial technology can be but also weighs the inevitable dehumanizing downfalls.  minority-report-4In the case of Precrime, the question of technology develops into one of Free Will versus Determinism within an entrenched timeline, and using said technology to breach that timeline. Beginning with the Precogs  prediction that Anderton will commit murder, the indictment sets into motion a chain of events that inevitably leads Anderton to kill his predicted target. So the question remains, would Anderton have killed Leo Crow if the accusation was not made? This is the film s philosophical paradox through which the McGuffin is rendered all-important; and while raised, the question can garner no correct response outside of creative guesswork. The critique of the would-be utopia is complete when Anderton rescues Agatha to find his minority report; he learns she is not a foreseeing wunderkind, but an accident resulting from her neurological drug-addicted mother, and a prisoner in her position. Atrophied and woozy from the sedatives the technicians keep her on to predict more fluently, Agatha is nearly broken, jaded by the present, and clumsily clinging to her rescuer. She informs Anderton that though he has no minority report, he has a choice; by knowing his future, he can thusly change it by force of will. The structure of Determinism is subject to the unpredictability of Free Will. Regardless of his lacking minority report, Anderton has the self-control not to kill Crow. This choice repeats itself in the finale when Anderton confronts Burgess, the architect of the film s frame job. The Precogs predict Burgess will kill Anderton, but Burgess chooses differently. The utopian aspects of the future, as well as The Precogs that are all but deified by their followers for the violence they have prevented, are both proven fa ades within a defective future bent on maintaining an illusion of perfection. In true form for Philip K. Dick, but strangely pessimistic for director Steven Spielberg, the film portrays the crumbling of a utopia through its reliance on its advances. Even if the story ends well for Anderton and the freed Precognitives, the future is nonetheless a bleak one.  Beyond the genius sewn into the fabric of its scenario, its thread reinforced by the intricacy of its setting, Spielberg composed Minority Report to be a fast-paced union of brains and virtuoso sequences. This is pure, deftly stylized cinema hurtling from one crisis to another with incredible speed and breadth and cunning. John Williams  thrilling and playful score forms a pitch-perfect marriage with the breakneck proceedings, and the noirish storyline, wrapped inside its science-fiction framework, gives way to an uncommonly exciting motion picture of substantial characters and profoundly involving sci-fi applications. The visionary quality of Minority Report s cinematic world is matched solely by its endless influence on both film and real-world technology since its release. But most importantly, its influence never overwhelms the picture itself. Spielberg s film is ingenious not only for the filmmaker s countless moments of cinematic resourcefulness and aesthetic wonderment, but for how every fascinating bit of technology or invention suffused into the film has a direct implication on the forward-moving plot and its intensely feeling characters, and furthermore, how the plot expounds an underlying philosophical question. Deepening the kinetics of an adventure, Minority Report maintains the power of a dynamic, ceaselessly entertaining, cerebral series of ideas born in the limitless mind of Philip K. Dick. Indeed, few films have ever been so much all at once and done so with such sublime artistry.",CBS_Doc2_MinorityReport,CBS,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority Report
82,CBS_Doc3_MinorityReport,"Minority Report might take place some fifty years after the film was shot but the film s themes are still relevant almost twenty years later. This film marks the first collaboration between Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise.  The film has audiences asking some important questions.  What if we knew what was going to happen in the future?  After you ask yourself the question, what if the person knowing this found out he was going to kill someone?  This is the gist of the film, which is based on the Philip K. Dick short story.  Another thing here is that the audience must be able to buy into the science early on in the film. This is key to being able to just sit back and enjoy the ride.  If you re watching the film for the first time in 2020, the science is very believable.  It s amazing how much of the science is catching up right in front of us.  There s something to be said about the eye-dentification.  Social media platforms already know our faces.  Companies target us online because of internet cookies.  One could look at author Philip K. Dick as a prophet in the world of science-fiction.  In case you didn t know, Dick is also the man behind Blade Runner.  One of the film s main themes is free will vs. determinism.  The film handles this so beautifully.  If we know our future, could we possibly do something to change it?  The Department of PreCrime, at least in what we see on screen, is mostly focusing on preventing murders.  This is where the three pre-cognitives are the main focus.  Two twin males and one female share a common trait.  They see the future and the visions appear on a giant screen.  Together, they re able to see the future.  They have no interaction with the outside world.  The department s agents work to arrest people on the basis of the visions.  PreCrime Captain John Anderton (Tom Cruise) has turned to drugs since his son, Sean, disappeared.  Anderton is also separated from his wife, Lara (Kathryn Morris).  Anderton just happens to have the unfortunate luck of being in the pre-cogs vision when DOJ agent Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is visiting the agency.  Talk about bad luck!  Anderton now goes on the run and PreCrime creator Dr. Iris Hineman (Lois Smith) tells him that Agatha (Samantha Morton) sometimes has a different vision.  Dr. Hineman refers to this as a  minority report.   There s a lot of mystery in the film surrounding the death of Ann Lively (Jessica Harper).  She just happens to be Agatha s mother.  The further we get into the film, Anderton learns that he s being framed.  Meanwhile, Witwer starts studying the available footage and starts to believe the same.  Anybody in the right mind would do what he does next.  But what Witwer doesn t know is that the director and founder of PreCrime, Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow), is covering up the murder.  Goodbye Witwer! In many aspects, Minority Report falls under the usual sci-fi playground.  But more than this, the action thriller also ventures into film noir territory.  We can also see this in the film s color palette.   It s the grittiest looking entertainment movie I ve ever done,  Spielberg says in the bonus features.  He doesn t count Schindler s List or Saving Private Ryan.  John Williams s work is a departure from the usual Spielberg film scores.  Tonality common in Williams s work for Spielberg is missing in the film.  Instead, the music plays more to the film s suspense.  Because of the film s genre, Williams s score also draws on the work from legendary film composer Bernard Herrmann.  It s not uncommon for Spielberg to tell stories during the past (cough World War II).  This film sees Spielberg jumping fifty years into the future.  One thing that has me asking questions is noting the film s release comes after the Patriot Act is signed into law.  One can imagine this being on Spielberg s mind when he was shooting the film.  It is certainly something to think about.  The major monuments are still standing in the nation s capital.  Spielberg is a fan of set design and construction.  This really shows through in the film.  The precog set itself is a major set piece in the film.  But still, he relies on physical sets rather than CGI. Spielberg on using physical sets over digital during The Future According to Steven Spielberg:  I guess a day will come when it ll be cheaper to do it all digitally. I hope that day never comes because the craft and the art of design it helps the actors so much to come into a room that is the room that we re photographing that gives them an environment to bounce off of. It gives the actors a world to act in.  Spielberg also stops Tom Cruise from doing some dangerous stunts a few times.  Much like Harrison Ford, Cruise is the type to do his own stunts.  Whatever works, I suppose!  If there s the smallest chance that they get it wrong, an innocent person ends up getting arrested.  Because of this, I would not be able to support such a PreCrime concept as envisioned in the film.  There s a lot to be said about the current criminal justice system.  We know that there are flaws.  We can see it in the system today.  Minority Report leaves much to debate about the film s themes and the rightness or wrongness.",CBS_Doc3_MinorityReport,CBS,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority Report
83,CBS_Doc4_MinorityReport,"In the satirically detailed world of Minority Report, which unfolds in 2054, you can t walk into a Gap store without a hologram greeting you by name and complimenting you on the last item you bought there   perhaps you d care for a black tank-top? Privacy is dead, and people visit a virtual-reality club to explore their wildest fantasies; one man wants to kill his boss, but knows that if he plans to do it for real, Washington s Pre-Crime unit will catch him before he carries it out. Experience seems to be dead, too. The population is safe from certain forms of physical aggression, but they ve all been pre-emptively neutered, like Alex in A Clockwork Orange.  I refer to that Stanley Kubrick classic for a reason: Minority Report, despite some eleventh-hour lapses and rhetorical flab, is the movie A.I. should have been. Steven Spielberg, adapting Kubrick s long-cherished project last year, missed the mark so completely that the result offered the best of neither director. But Minority Report is the real thing, more Kubrick than anything Spielberg has done, and more Spielberg than anything Spielberg has done in too many years. I had given up hope, fearing Spielberg to be lost in his warm bubble bath of homilies: His recent movies haven t been entertaining or even educational   they ve been instructional. Well, Spielberg seems to have snapped out of it. He is working once again with his trademark effortless sense of purpose and precision. If his previous recent films have been tepid baths, this one is a cold shower   shocking and revivifying.  Tom Cruise is John Anderton, ace  detective  for the Pre-Crime unit. Spielberg s and Cruise s first collaboration has not produced the expected smiling, cocky, full-blooded hero, but rather an angry, hollow, flawed man, who takes drugs to kill his torment over his kidnapped little boy. Anderton is thus driven to stop crimes before they happen, though his logic is faulty, since a boy can be kidnapped and tortured for years without being  seen  by Pre-Crime s three precognitives, who can only see future murders. Cruise plays Anderton as a man who throws all his faith into the  perfect  Pre-Crime structure because if it is shown to be faulty, his work   his reason for not eating his gun   is rendered meaningless.  Faulty it is, though. The  Pre-Cogs    cleverly named Agatha, Arthur and Dashiell    see  Anderton killing someone within 36 hours, a man he s never met. The full weight of the Pre-Crime force   led by Max von Sydow as its figurehead and Colin Farrell as a sort of internal-affairs investigator looking for flaws in the system   comes down on Anderton, who flees into the city. It s there that Minority Report most closely resembles a previous bitter dystopian drama inspired, like this one, by a Philip K. Dick story: Blade Runner, in which Harrison Ford bumped up against a menagerie of colorful characters. Here, Anderton meets a crackpot who traffics in black-market eyes (Peter Stormare), a virtual-reality pimp (Jason Antoon), a wise old woman who accidentally started the whole Pre-Crime project (Lois Smith), all of whom can help him, but only so much.  Anderton goes on the run with Agatha (Samantha Morton in an alternately touching and alarming performance), the most powerful of the Pre-Cogs, and Spielberg stages their adventures   a bit of business with police spiders, a beautifully timed chase sequence wherein Agatha s psychic abilities come in handy   with all his old genius for momentum and humor arising from personality and situation; I cannot help loving a film in which the high-tech Pre-Crime officers, with all the gimmickry at their fingertips, are foiled by some children s balloons.  The look of the film, by way of cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, is ominously blue and bleached and untouchable, but Spielberg packs the frame with reminders of humanity trudging along despite the bleakness of its surroundings (I particularly enjoyed the glimpse of a man lost in a virtual-reality daydream of being lavishly praised by his peers). Toward the end, Samantha Morton sells the hell out of a windy speech about how Anderton s home is full of psychic residue of love for his son, but it s still a windy speech; and Spielberg reneges on the uncompromising film noir denouement the material well-nigh demands. Still, this is the most exciting piece of work Spielberg has delivered in ages   clean, supple, and emotionally engaging without being emotionally overbearing.",CBS_Doc4_MinorityReport,CBS,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority Report
84,CBS_Doc5_MinorityReport,"As a director, Steven Spielberg owns one of the greatest track records of his generation. I think the secret of Spielberg's success is that, unlike many other currently prominent directors, he is more able to balance the high-tech, effects-driven aspects of his movies with the much more important human factor. Although many of his most popular films have been effects extravaganzas like E.T., Close Encounters, and Jurassic Park, some of his best films are the ones where effects take a back seat to character and relationship work; i.e., Schindler's List, Amistad, Saving Private Ryan. Although Spielberg's latest effort, Minority Report, is admittedly one of his more emotionally sterile productions, it is not unlike last year's A.I. in that it features a fascinating, futuristic concept (based on the short story by Philip K. Dick, first published in Fantastic Universe magazine in 1956), with just enough of the human touch to make it emotionally accessible to the audience. While we may marvel at the ideas of crimes being predicted by psychic clairvoyants, or cars that glide effortlessly and automatically down the sides of skyscrapers and merge onto the highway with nary an accident, or advertisements that speak to you by name after having read your retinal scan, the issue more resonant to us is the man who has lost his little boy, and it is this issue that drives the film. Of course, it doesn't hurt to have reliable actors like Tom Cruise and Max von Sydow, not to mention a huge and uniformly capable supporting cast, and writers like Scott Frank and Jon Cohen, who adapted Dick's 50-year-old story for a current audience, or the tense and powerful music of Spielberg's longtime friend and composer, John Williams, to help with the overall effect. The story is set in Washington, D.C., in the year 2054. The city's law enforcement authorities have begun an experimental procedure for which they hope to seek acceptance (and funding) on a national level, called the PreCrime agency. Devised by retired law enforcement officer and elder statesman Lamar Burgess (von Sydow), the system uses the talents of three people with exceptional psychic abilities who are kept in a constant state of dream sleep by a combination of mind-numbing drugs, partial immersion in a huge sensory-deprivation tank, and electronic ""halos"" attached to their heads (which basically give them the Jack Nicholson treatment from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest). Using the fragmented images seen by these ""precognitives,"" which are projected onto a screen and interpreted by agents like Detective John Anderton (Cruise), the agency is able to predict and prevent every murder that is about to happen in the city, deftly stepping in and arresting the suspect before the crime has even been committed and fitting him with his own halo so he can enjoy the paralytic state that will keep him quiet while he rots in suspended-animation prison. Boasting a spotless record over the past several years, the PreCrime agency has made Washington the safest city in the U.S., with no murders reported since the program began. When Detective Ed Witwer (Colin Farrell) is sent in by the attorney general to investigate the system for possible flaws (like a misread prediction resulting in a wrongful imprisonment), Anderton, who is wrestling with a drug addiction following the disappearance of his young son and subsequent dissolution of his marriage, feels his hackles rise. ""The system is perfect;"" he states, ""the fact that we prevent the crime doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen."" Unfortunately, the next image that comes in features Anderton himself as the killer, murdering a man he's never seen or heard of, supposedly within the next 36 hours. Suddenly he finds himself on the run from the very system he has championed, trying to find out whether he is the victim of a ""false positive"" or if he's really going to kill this man and if so, why. Although this film is nearly 2  hours long (also like A.I.), it is almost constantly riveting, either from the standpoint of its futuristic vision or its tense plot line. There are definitely some holes in the story, and the twists and turns taken in the final half hour are at times predictable, but as always, Spielberg delivers a product which is much more than the sum of its parts, so well-rendered, technically and emotionally, that it somehow excuses its own transgressions. In addition to the principals, fine acting performances are given by Samantha Morton as the ""precog"" forced, if only briefly, to function in the unforgiving present, distinguished actress Lois Smith as the eccentric matriarch of the PreCrime system, and Peter Stormare as a skilled but unconventional eye doctor. Minority Report adds yet another jewel to director Spielberg's crown, and another entry to the short list of truly thoughtful and intelligent films in the futuristic science fiction genre.",CBS_Doc5_MinorityReport,CBS,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority Report
85,CBS_Doc6_MinorityReport,"Minority Report is the latest film directed by Steven Spielberg. In the year 2054 murder has been eliminated in Washington DC through the use of a team of psychics who infallibly foresee killings. The would-be murderers are apprehended before they commit their crimes and sent to cryogenic freezing units. When the leading figure in the  Pre-Crime Unit,  John Anderton (Tom Cruise), is named as the future killer of a man he does not know, he sets out to unravel the mystery, with his own police force hot on his trail. Anderton s own son was abducted and presumably murdered some years before, an event that also shattered his marriage.  Spielberg is one of the more gifted members of a generation of studio filmmakers whose output in general has been exceedingly poor and forgettable. He has the undoubted ability to narrate a drama effectively, to hold the spectator s attention and to develop a theme. His themes, however, tend to revolve around the concerns of his generation of upper middle class Americans. It is surely notable that in a filmmaking career spanning thirty tumultuous years, Spielberg, whose personal wealth reportedly exceeds $2 billion, has not once weighed in tellingly on the state of American society.  Minority Report, based on a 1956 short story by science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, has intriguing and entertaining elements. No expense has been spared. The filmmakers have thought up all manner of ingenious devices, combining the retrograde and the futuristic, to create the world of 2054. However, as is nearly always the case in contemporary science fiction, the imagination has only been set to work on  things,  not relations between people, not social life.  There are absurdities in Minority Report which reveal a great deal about the social assumptions and prejudices of its creators. The American society of half a century from now is presented as generally prosperous and content, insofar as one is able to determine, but crime and murder (and drug use) persist. Why? Is there no connection between poverty and violent behavior, or, more generally, between social reality and crime? The filmmakers are either adapting to themselves to the right-wing argument that crime is essentially causeless (rooted in Man s fallen state) or, probably more to the point, indicating their lack of interest in its causes and a concern merely with the means of avoiding its consequences.  The discovery that the psychics do not always agree, that there are suppressed  minority reports,  suggesting other possible outcomes, is the turning point in Spielberg s film. The Pre-Crime Unit may, in fact, be seizing and incarcerating those who were never going to commit any offenses. Anderton finds out for himself the complex relationship between the apparently inevitable and the actual manner in which events play themselves out.  One can only respond: thank heavens for small mercies. Steven Spielberg and company do not, in the end, come down on the side of preemptively locking up everyone who is a potential criminal. A great day for democracy indeed!  It was apparently a close call, however. When Spielberg was first considering the film project, he told Time, he   had much more of a popcorn movie in mind until I began to think about the ramifications of arresting people without due process.  The director says it was his friend Doris Kearns Goodwin, the historian, who alerted him to the constitutional problems of Precrime.  She said,  This would be a wonderful thing,  recalls Spielberg,  but what about the Bill of Rights?     Spielberg and Goodwin are not the only ones who find the idea appealing. Critic David Edelstein in Slate writes:  The movie presents us with a classic totalitarian trade-off, upgraded by technology and the paranormal: Would you surrender a slew of civil liberties for a world without crime? Assuming that the right people were always jailed for the right reasons, I d think about it long and hard.   The assumption of all the above, of course, is that the state is a disinterested body, guided by fundamentally honorable motives, whose only concern is the welfare of its citizens. The notion that the state might represent distinct social interests, that it might be in the business of repressing the population for distinct political purposes these are entirely foreign concepts to Spielberg and friends, who are, after all, a generally satisfied lot.  This is not to say that the film offers no critique of the future world, or by implication, the present one. Spielberg is not a fool, nor simply a propagandist for the existing state of things. (After all, Schindler s List had its moments.) The sight of helmeted, black-outfitted police crashing through windows and ceilings to apprehend individuals whose only crime is harboring violent thoughts is menacing and ominous as are the images of mechanical spiders, who detect human presence, invading and searching an apartment building. However, Minority Report is largely carried along by other concerns and social impulses.  Corporate saturation of American life, aided by technology, has reached such a point in 2054 that electronic billboards recognize the consumer (by his or her eyes) and deliver a personalized message. ( Good afternoon, Mr. Yakamoto. How did you like that three-pack of tank tops you bought last time you were in? ) On Internetnews.com Pamela Parker comments:  Imagine getting splashed by an animated digital billboard advertising Aquafina. Or having an ad in the subway say,  [Your name here], you look like you could use a Guinness,  just as you re coming home after a bad day at work. At one point in the movie the Tom Cruise character, on the run, is confronted by an American Express ad that says,  It looks like you need an escape, and Blue can take you there. ... Identification of consumers happens via retinal scans, which are presumably matched with names in a global database.   This invasive commercialism is more a source of amusement in the film, however, than disgust or protest. In any event, Spielberg is critiquing what his film encourages. Minority Report practices  product placement  (the display of commercial brands in a film) at a high level, providing advertising for Lexus, Reebok, Nokia, The Gap, Guinness, American Express, Bulgari and Pepsi-Cola s Aquafina, among others.  This  product placement  does not come free of charge. Lexus reportedly paid $5 million for the privilege of having a futuristic version of one of its automobiles appear in Minority Report. Business Week reports that  as part of the deal, the auto maker also delivered a shiny new $62,000 Lexus SC 430 convertible to Spielberg.  The magazine continues:  Why would Lexus put all that money into helping Spielberg design a pair of cars that will never be sold? Explains [Lexus marketing vice-president Mike] Wells:  We wanted to show the world that Lexus as a brand will be standing tall in 50 years.    And there is more:  Lexus wasn t the only large advertiser to help Spielberg defray the costs of making his film, which is laden with special effects. Phonemaker Nokia spent an estimated $2 million to design the futuristic handsets that Cruise and others use in the film, according to sources. Nokia also is running print and TV commercials to promote the film and its new 9290 Communicator, a $599 phone released in May, 2002, that can send and receive images, sound, and video clips. In addition, Nokia is promoting Minority Report on its Web site, where users can see the phone it designed for the film.   What is one to say? How could a film produced with such a degree of collaboration between filmmakers and giant transnational corporations possibly be expected to provide a clear-sighted view of contemporary life? At a time, no less, when the pervasive criminality of the corporate boardroom, its looting of the American economy of trillions of dollars, has been exposed.  Hollywood s liberals The views of Spielberg and his associates on crime, the police and democratic rights are conditioned by their social circumstances and connections. The garden variety Hollywood liberal, rich and complacent, would prefer, all things considered and if it did not prove too much of an inconvenience (or threaten his stock portfolio or career prospects), to live in a world where universal brotherhood reigned supreme. He does not view  democracy,  however, in association with the right of the broad mass of the population to decent living standards and to be defended against the coercive power of the capitalist state. In fact, he never thinks of such a thing at all, as contemporary films make clear. On the contrary, under conditions of growing social inequality, the population at large is seen in a generally hostile manner, as a potential threat to his wealth and privileges.  All this directs today s studio filmmaker irresistibly toward the figure of the policeman, both because he is the defender of private property (and thus deeply fascinating on the conscious and unconscious levels to the wealthy) and because he can be made to represent, falsely,  blue-collar  America.  Minority Report provides us with a policeman s-eye view, filtered through layers of Hollywood liberal cotton-wadding, of the issue of the police-state.  In that sense, the filmmakers  decision in the end to come down against  pre-crime,  while not unimportant, hardly stands out as a compelling defense of basic democratic rights. One only has to read the ignorant and wrongheaded comments of co-screenwriter Scott Frank:  People can be against capital punishment until they lose a loved one. We can be completely civilized until the murder rate goes way up and we need to figure out how to bring in the troops. That s how dictatorships get started; it s always for the greater good.   Minority Report s general ambience reminds one of the discussions that took place in the liberal media following September 11 about the advisability of applying torture to terrorist suspects. The various commentators mulled over the idea of torturing prisoners, rolled it around on their tongues, so to speak, and generally concluded that, while tempting, it was probably not such a good idea. That such a discussion even takes place, whatever the immediate conclusions drawn, tells one everything about the given social milieu.  Planning for Minority Report began three years ago and filming in March 2001. In its own peculiar fashion, this provides further proof that the Bush administration s indefinite detention of individuals charged with no crime, the policy of making  preemptive arrests,  was not merely a response to the terrorist attack on New York and Washington, but was something very much  in the air.  It is a response, when viewed historically, to the increasingly untenable social contradictions of American society and the straining of these contradictions against the traditional forms of bourgeois democracy.  Much has been made in the media about the coincidence of Minority Report s opening and the incarceration of Jose Padilla, the alleged  dirty bomb  conspirator. The government claims the right to  anticipatory self-defense,  a phrase worthy of Spielberg s  Pre-Crime Unit.  The film director told the New York Times in June:  Right now, people are willing to give away a lot of their freedoms in order to feel safe. They re willing to give the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. far-reaching powers to, as George W. Bush often says, root out those individuals who are a danger to our way of living. I am on the president s side in this instance. I am willing to give up some of my personal freedoms in order to stop 9/11 from ever happening again. But the question is, Where do you draw the line? How much freedom are you willing to give up? That is what this movie is about.   Minority Report has to be seen in the context of the subservience and spinelessness of Hollywood liberalism, and American liberalism in general. Those who wonder out loud about the pros and cons of a police-state have already accepted such a regime in principle. The passionate defense of democratic rights, as we have noted more than once on the WSWS, finds fewer and fewer partisans within the upper echelons of American society.",CBS_Doc6_MinorityReport,CBS,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority Report
86,CBS_Doc7_MinorityReport,"They Know Action, But They Don't Know Dick OVER THE past twenty years, the works of Philip K. Dick have become the hottest sf based-upons in Hollywood. Many have speculated on the reason. True believers think it's the cosmic inevitability of PKD's epistemological genius, which has the power to reach even the soul-dead executives of the major studios. (But these folks are, conversely, so outraged by how the holy writ has been distorted and defiled by movie makers that they wish the current and planned screen adaptations would just go away.) Others simply see the late great author's themes as highly relevant, and then some.  Dickian ""paranoia"" about corporate and government iniquity certainly speaks even more eloquently to a society faced with a steady stream of news stories about Enrons, Halliburtons, and the frightening examples of governmental surveillance and detentions that have occurred since 9-11 and the passage of the PATRIOT Act. But Philip K. Dick isn't the only sf author to explore such issues. Nor is he the only author to ruminate on the nature of reality and humanity.  As talented and timely a writer as Mr. Dick is, his Hollywood hot property status probably has less to do with him or his literary executors than it does with a gentleman named Ridley Scott. The film industry leeches on literature, it's true. But it absolutely feasts upon itself. Blade Runner (1982), a screenplay by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, based upon PKD's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, was directed with such style and verve by Scott that Hollywood took notice. That, despite the fact that the film did less than booming box office when it was first released.  The full screen potential of science fiction could not be denied after Blade Runner (and Scott's previous space creature feature, Alien). Visual flair, philosophical substance, and kick-ass action can come together to make an entertaining and artistically compelling movie. Blade Runner proved that. Unfortunately, although major and minor studios as well as independent and international filmmakers have gone back to the well of Dickian fact and fiction again and again since 1982, none of the resulting films have equaled Scott's influential masterwork.  But that doesn't keep them from trying.  Steven Spielberg's Minority Report (2002) is the most recent high-profile entry. It's a handsome film certainly better than A.I. but ultimately rather tedious and falsely sentimental, as Spielberg films have a tendency to be. And now we have another PKD adaptation. A much, much different film that, while not a complete offense against the viewing public, manages to lose the wonder of its Dickian story in the pyrotechnics of conventional filmmaking.  Paycheck, based on the 1953 Dick short story by the same name, features a screenplay by Dean Georgaris. And the adaptation isn't half bad. In some ways sacrilege alert to all PKD devotees it actually improves on the source material. My own feeling about Dick's original ""Paycheck"" is that it presents a dandy story concept but that the narrative collapses at the end.  The basic conceit, as most of you probably remember, is that an electrical ""mechanic"" named Jen nings does a top secret job for a mysterious company. Upon leaving the job, he learns that his authoritarian government is acutely interested in his work. However, even if our hero were interested in betraying his former employer, he cannot. To protect the company, Jennings's memory of his work had been erased before he left his job. And in even more bad news, when he goes to pick up his pay, Jennings learns to his shock that he has forfeited his salary for a handful of trinkets. Things are not looking good for the poor schmo. But soon, Jennings realizes that the seemingly worthless bits and pieces he possesses are actually the key to his successful navigation of his perilous immediate future.  Like I say, it's one corker of a story idea. It's the way it played out that left me less than thrilled.  I was never convinced that Rethrick Construction and its autocratic CEO were any more benign than the government with its Security Police. And Jennings, the ingenious yet na ve hero of the story, has an inflated sense of his own sex appeal if he thinks that the female office manager at Rethrick would be the best choice as an ally in skullduggery against the company she's worked for for years. At the tale's end, we are left with the strangest possible happy ending: A new family is formed from an uppity blackmailer, a tired yet faintly megalomanaical magnate, and a dutiful daughter. Even without the future-capturing mirror and ""scoop"" of the plot, I could predict something less than domestic and corporate bliss for Dick's characters.  Mr. Georgaris retains PKD's basic story idea, but (as all those pesky Dickian adaptors are wont to do) changes and updates at will. Some of the changes are made to reflect the current cultural Zeitgeist. Americans distrust the government, but at the moment not as much as they distrust Big Business. Therefore, the police, as represented by FBI agents Dodge (Joe Morton) and Klein (Michael C. Hall), are actually portrayed as a lesser evil than the nefarious industrialist, Rethrick (Aaron Eckhart), and his many associates and goons.  Mr. Georgaris also deep-sixes the time ""scoop"" idea good choice, that in favor of a time machine that simply views the future. He also throws in the standard modern movie ""buddy."" In this case, he is a well-intentioned memory-erasure technician, Shorty, played with his standard offbeat charm by Paul Giamatti. (Is the Shorty character necessary? Nah! But since Giamatti is one of the more enjoyable aspects of the film, I can't complain about him being there.)  As for the role of the girl, as befits twenty-first-century movie sensibilities, she has been promoted from the secretarial pool and transformed into a research biologist who can kickbox with the best of them. But, of course, she is still a babe. Here, named Rachel, and played by Uma Thurman.  The screenplay isn't without its time paradox violations and its not-so-little absurdities, but the biggest problem I have with Paycheck has little to do with its plot or character development. It largely fails as a movie because it too forcefully tries to identify itself as an action (and I do mean ACTION) film. I could blame this mindless pursuit of the conventions of a hackneyed formula on the screenwriter, but something tells me it has more to do with the director helming the project. In this case, that director would be the brilliant Hong Kong hyper-violence auteur, John Woo.  Mr. Woo's career has generally floundered since he arrived in Hollywood. His talents simply do not superimpose well upon the kinds of movie properties with which he has been entrusted. Paycheck is not as explosively miserable as Windtalkers, Woo's earlier mangling of the story of the Navajo code-talkers of WWII, but it is clearly a bad match between material and director.  Yes, Paycheck should have been a thriller. But it was meant to be a suspenseful yarn with subtle twists and frequent surprises. Its storyline is poorly served by the kind of over-the-top shootouts, chases, and shattering sets that are the stock in trade of John Woo. If the hero needs to get away from both corporate baddies and the feds, he is forced to lead a ten-minute motorcycle chase through city streets, causing vehicles to careen and crash endlessly, before he ends up in a stockyard where gravel flies, and so does he, through a very convenient but highly improbable tunnel made up of countless box trailers, all handily open on both ends.  Want a clich d almost-run-down-by-a-train scene? Why not? Perhaps, when forced to defend himself, the hero should turn out to be an expert at kung-fu stick fighting. Sounds like a plan! And in the movie's conclusion, why not blow everything in sight to kingdom come, with fire and showering glass shards kerplewing in every direction. Destroy everything and everyone except the hero and his girl, of course both of whom come out looking like they've suffered nothing more than a rough day at the office.  I have heard a good bit of grumbling about the fact that Paycheck's hero, updated as a high-tech reverse engineer, is played by Ben Affleck. But I really don't think that Affleck is the worst of this film's worries. As I have commented before (when I recently reviewed Daredevil), dear Ben is certainly not the greatest thespian of his generation. And with his very sleek good looks, he is hardly my idea of a believable techie nerd, either. (Wouldn't it be fun to reshoot this movie with Paul Giamatti in the lead?)  However, cocky and tense are two emotions that Ben Affleck just about has mastered. He doesn't need much more than that to pull off the role of Michael Jennings. And, really, folks, he is no more unbelievable as a research scientist than the even more beauteous Greg Peck was as a psychiatrist in Hitchcock's Spellbound. Affleck is a Hollywood leading man. He is capable of holding our attention and our sympathies at least as well as Minority Report's Tom Cruise (who has always made my skin crawl and is also no virtuoso in the acting department). Ben can't, however, make Paycheck into the good movie it might have been. That would have required a director more interested in ideas and less interested in things that go boom.  John Woo is not that director.  Gary Fleder, on the other hand, might be.  Best known for this past autumn's Runaway Jury, the director actually helmed a PKD movie adaptation a few years back that few people have seen. Impostor, based on the story of the same name, was originally meant as a movie short for a trilogy feature. It was expanded to full-length for Dimension films, but then shelved by the studio for two years. It was thereafter quietly dumped onto the market, surfacing on late night cable and the back shelves of video stores.  Let me suggest that you dust off a copy and bring it home. For Impostor is a much better movie than Paycheck could ever hope to be.  True, Impostor has a small budget that sometimes shows, and Fleder's direction seems a bit shaky, at times. (But when a movie is expanded from short to feature, and written by a committee of screenwriters, I am inclined to give a guy the benefit of the doubt.) The film also sometimes substitutes darkness for true atmosphere. This is less of an issue on a large screen, but since you will probably be viewing it on a smallish TV screen, a certain amount of viewer frustration may result.  Yet despite its shortcomings, Impostor is a solid science fiction film. Not as elegant as Blade Runner, certainly. But a heck of a lot better than most of the other PKD screen conversions of the last two decades. One crucial difference is that the film relies on real acting instead of star turns. The hero of the movie, a defense research scientist named Spencer Olham, is played by Gary Sinise. One day, Olham is accused of not being who he believes himself to be by a ruthless security agent, Major Hathaway (Vincent D'Onofrio). Hathaway claims that Olham is actually a replicant smart bomb designed to do maximum damage. The major hopes to murder Olham before he can attack a beleaguered Earth. Olham hopes to stay alive long enough to prove his innocence.  With Sinise and D'Onofrio in the principal leads, you should already be heading for the video store. But this movie has more than solid acting to recommend it. It actually seems more interested in Dickian ruminations into the nature of reality and human identity than it does in blowing things up. Although guns are fired and explosions do occur, Impostor isn't afraid to slow things down a bit and substitute a bit of old-fashioned suspense for some of the standard-issue Hollywood violence. This movie is even brave enough to end on a very disquieting note.  No wonder the studio abandoned it!  Hollywood may be in love with the idea of adapting PKD. But only so it can say (as Paramount exclaims in its publicity squibs for Paycheck) that its movie comes from ""the author who brought you Minority Report and Blade Runner.""  Forget about Paycheck, and instead seek out Impostor. It's the genuine article.",CBS_Doc7_MinorityReport,CBS,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority Report
87,CBS_Doc8_MinorityReport,"What new hell is this? In the shallow, noisy and pretentious Minority Report , we have seen the future. It s not pretty.  There are two Steven Spielbergs. One is the cinematic historian who instructs, informs and shapes a universal consciousness that makes us aware of our stake in the human race in masterpieces like Schindler s List and Saving Private Ryan . The other is a 12-year-old comic-book collector weaned on sci-fi and stuck in the twilight zone of his own nursery, who turns out polished but moronic time-wasters about dinosaurs, space ships, Indiana Jones and Peter Pan. Quel doppelg nger . I always have a hard time believing the same man capable of both greatness ( The Color Purple ) and trash ( Jurassic Park ). Occasionally, a film like E.T. or Raiders of the Lost Ark emerges to meld the technical proficiency of the craftsman with the passion of the storyteller. Bloody, violent, cold and preposterous, Minority Report is not one of them. Despite an astronomical budget and a gallimaufry of twists and turns enhanced by special effects, Minority Report has a boring, one-dimensional story line you could write on one page of Big Chief tablet paper with a No. 2 lead pencil. Derived from a story by sci-fi spinmaster Philip K. Dick (the man responsible for Blade Runner ), it s set in Washington, D.C., in 2054. Crime has been wiped out thanks to an experimental Pre-Crime Unit called a  priori,  developed by wacko scientist Max von Sydow, that can predict murders before they happen. Tom Cruise plays Detective John Anderton, the futuristic cop in charge of preventing homicides with the aid of three psychic visionaries called  Pre-Cogs  who float around in a liquid wading pool wired, drugged and having nightmares. Waving his arms like Leonard Bernstein in the orchestra pit, Anderton can download images of clues, suspects and crime scenes, then lead his futuristic crimebusters to the killers before they pull the trigger. With beady eyes, flexed jaw and a buzz cut, he s a man whose life is already so haunted by the abduction and murder of his only son that he looks and acts creepier than the Pre-Cogs. The world has apparently survived John Ashcroft, because the Justice Department thinks the Pre-Crime Unit is too controversial a concept to go national. In a subplot that goes nowhere, Irish hunk Colin Farrell is wasted as the dull F.B.I. investigator from the Attorney General s office who covets Anderton s job. The lulling narrative drones on until the tables turn and Anderton is named by the Pre-Cogs as the next murderer. From here, the movie turns from a whodunit into a who ll-do-it as the flawed hero (he s hooked on drugs) has 36 hours to solve his own case and clear his name by breaking into the Pre-Crime lab and downloading the info from the Pre-Cog who predicted it-and Mr. Spielberg sweats it all out, stretching the film s playing time to two hours plus. Mr. Cruise, who barely survived Vanilla Sky , one of the worst movies ever made, bares his teeth and pecs in a variation of the same role he played in that fiasco-a man driven insane by a technological bad dream. Not much of a stretch there, and the techno-gibberish about  Pre-Cog echoes  and  prevision data bases,  spouted with a terminally pained expression from the ludicrous script by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen, almost flattens him. Meanwhile, Mr. Spielberg pours on the gore. In one scene, the star has his eyeballs surgically removed because in the future, we are told, identity searches scan only eyes. (Gee, whatever happened to fingerprints?) Carrying around those Tom Cruise eyes in a plastic bag as a sentimental keepsake, he drops one retina through the cracks of a drain while the other one hangs by its bloody optical nerves. Not a movie for anyone considering corrective Lasik procedures, or even changing contact lenses. Also not a movie where acting counts. Samantha Morton, with a shaved head, has an out-of-body experience as the Pre-Cog who disagrees with the others (this is called a  minority report ). Tim Blake Nelson plays the fiend who contains all of the killers, rapists and psychos from the past in data pods. The marvelous Lois Smith, who steals her brief scenes with relish as a horticulturist who holds the secrets to the minority reports, is nutty as a pecan pie. But the characters aren t human enough to be real, or metaphorical enough to be comic caricatures. In the end, they are all upstaged by the macabre effects, created by production designer Alex McDowell, that make the whole movie look as though it was staged inside a stainless-steel paint bucket. When in doubt, bring on the gimmicks. Mr. Spielberg complies, showing off the latest stunts, tricks and toys as distractions far more interesting than the movie itself. Futuristic subway riders reading digital newspapers in which the headlines change between stops. Cops flying through space between skyscrapers like Superman in magnetic-levitation cars. Angry trees that grab you like the nasty apple orchard in The Wizard of Oz , injecting a poison that can only be cured by a foul-tasting brewed tea. Animatronic spiders slithering through walls and floorboards to identify suspects by shining a light in their eyes. Loopily cinematic, Mr. Spielberg the practical joker even stages a chase scene in a Gap store.  Some things never change. Niche filmmaking will obviously still plague us in 2054, and so will the serious, unsettling questions it raises but fails to answer. Why is it that the visions of the Pre-Cogs never extend beyond Washington, D.C.? How will the Orwellian effect of the new technology invade privacy and affect civil rights? If the Pre-Cogs see different images, how can you prove a crime is going to happen beyond a reasonable doubt? In the ideological confusion, the film loses its credibility and raises more legal, social and political questions than it can handle. Mr. Cruise gets lost in the stew like a carrot. He looks like hell and goes through hell to earn his millions, but in Minority Report he s just a small black hole at the center of an even bigger black hole.",CBS_Doc8_MinorityReport,CBS,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority Report
88,CBS_Doc9_MinorityReport,"Most of the hope that I had for Minority Report, Steven Spielberg s adaptation of a classic Phillip K. Dick short story drained away early on, as soon as I saw one overly cute element of the film s set design. In Spielberg s vision of the near future (2054, to be exact), the Precogs, a trio of clairvoyant crack babies, are used to predict murders so they can be stopped before they are committed. To illustrate the process by which their predictions are delivered to the policemen that investigate them, he uses, for no good reason a spiraling glass ramp that delivers colorful balls with the perpetrator and victims  names on them. It s a distinctive touch, to be sure, and its one that could only exist in a child s vision of the future, and it feels entirely out of place among the sterile metal look that dominates the rest of the set. This fragment of his future is indicative of Minority Report s biggest problems, however. Spielberg uses images that could fascinate a child in his designs in hopes that they will appeal to everyone, and the resultant effect is the creation of a science fiction future that feels emotionally familiar and comfortable. While that might be some sort of achievement in itself, it works entirely against the plot of Report, which attempts to show us the dehumanizing effects of the invasion of privacy in its futuristic police state.           Unlike Dick, Spielberg s doesn t use science fiction to provide a cautionary and predictive look at the future. It instead fuels childish hope that all wishes will come true and fantasies will be fulfilled if we just have patience (consider ending of A.I. in this light). That s precisely why he s so wrong for this material. He has faith in happy endings even under totalitarianism, even when they make no emotional sense. In Minority Report, Spielberg s characters revert to using old technology (as opposed to the impotent, non-lethal weapons of the future) whenever someone actually dies, and by doing this he s suggesting that the human foibles and flaws that allow murder to happen are outmoded artifacts that will hopefully be phased out soon. This notion completely contradicts the film s ending, which vehemently denounces technology, and embraces those flaws. The way that the film is shot, though, it appears as if all of the color has been desaturated from the future world, leaving a pseudo-black and white wannabe-noir look, and that lack of shading is appropriate considering the sheer simplicity of the film s morality and symbolism. The attempts to push the morality of the characters into gray areas are so obviously going to be overcome by the film s end that they are completely ineffective in making the movie any more complex. The symbolism is even more laughably heavy handed. Early on, one character explicitly points out how goofy the clunky religious symbolism (there s a Holy Trinity, a Temple where humans play God, halos placed on convicts, etc ) that the movie employs is, but Spielberg continues to pile it on afterward, as John Anderton, Tom Cruise s harbinger of truth undergoes his spiritual and literal cleansing. Perhaps even more groan-worthy is the repeated use of the characters  eyes to reflect the true nature of their souls. A man with murder in his heart wears a pair of glasses that surely should be anachronistic post-Lasix. A drug dealer has empty sockets where his eyes should be. We know Anderton s ex-wife must be a decent person since she s a photographer. Cruise s cop on the lam has to lose his in order to be resurrected as humanity s savoir. It was enough to leave me rolling my eyes every time it resurfaced.           Spielberg s films have never been about great ideas, however, so the above gripes were hardly what ruined Minority Report for me. Despite some flat-out stunning visual effects, the film s vision of the future felt unconvincing. Every chase sequence that the film throws at us feels as if it is a big commercial. Product placement abounds in this vision of the future where the Gap store knows your name and every car seems to be the same make of Lexus (one apparently without a standard lowjack system, despite the obliteration of every other privacy right). Small change is still used and bums still beg for it and newspapers update so quickly that no writers could possibly have been involved in the journalism. The police use small spider-shaped robots to search private residences in what might have been the most harrowing scene of the film, but Spielberg makes sure that even they are humanized with double takes and endearing motions worthy of a Pixar cartoon. Though there s no apparent femme fatale among the noir homage in Minority Report, it soon becomes apparent that this technology itself is mankind s great seducer. Spielberg can t resist its siren s call, and he ironically ends up making a cautionary tale about his own directorial hubris. As he has done throughout his entire career, he puts too much faith in technique and technology here, and the resultant effort flounders.           Most of the directorial flourishes that do work here are unfortunately cribbed from more successful movies. Certainly, Spielberg owes a great debt to many classic film noir, since the trappings of the plot, the smart-aleck prison guard, and the look of the movie are derivative, but he might own even more to Kathryn Bigelow s underrated action masterpiece Strange Days. Alongside most of its attitudes toward technology, he also borrows from that superior film the sole witness to his murder mystery (recorded brain waves) and copies a sleazy computer geek character that deals in virtual recreations of experiences. Echoes of every type of film can be felt elsewhere, however. There s a chase scene through a dingy apartment that feels as if it came out of De Palma s The Fury, a run in with a gardener that resembles Poison Ivy from Batman & Robin, a scene in which a character s eyes are forced open   la A Clockwork Orange, cute kid banter ( How long can a whale hold its breath under water? ) that recalls Jerry Maguire, and a scene in which Cruise sheds his pretty face that s borrowed from Vanilla Sky. Less successfully integrated are several scenes of gross-out comedy where characters play with eyeballs and eat rotten food. Worst of all might be the obvious copy of the final shot of Andrei Tarkovsky s great sci-fi film Solaris, which is recreated here with none of the emotional weight that it had in the original. It s downright hilarious at one point when Samantha Morton, as the most fetching and eloquent of the crack babies, says,  I m tired of the future,  since the film seems so stuck in the past. Her bald character has been photographed like Dreyer shot Falconetti in his The Passion of Joan of Arc, but she s the opposite of the martyr that the visual homage leads us to expect. She shirks her social responsibility to gain personal freedom by the film s end, and unsurprisingly Spielberg expects us to cheer for the move.         Since all of the best stylistic elements of Minority Report are stolen, the packaging of the pastiche becomes of utmost importance, and that s when the disappointments of the plot become crushing. Myriad plot holes and contrivances* are to be found here, but many are so bad that they re inexcusable. A crucial flashback is continually interrupted at its climactic moment. The film never offers up a compelling reason why Anderton insists on facing his destiny. Knowing that he is facing an inevitable fate, he charges headlong toward it instead of simply burying himself for the thirty-six hours he has until it is supposed to come to fruition. This plot device effectively defuses any excitement for much of the movie. Since we know that he will never be captured and we know that no one will die as he attempts to escape his pursuers, little suspense builds during the action scenes. Since Minority Report is not a character study, some early scenes in which Anderton watches old home videos are so obviously expository that they render the film s biggest surprises completely predictable. It doesn t take a Precog to figure out where the film s plot is heading, and there s little excitement in getting there. To work, this sort of movie requires a level of coherency that Minority Report simply doesn t have. It s not a total waste, however. As noted above the effects are great, the cinematography is stellar, and the acting is solid, if not as good as it was in A.I.. I didn t love Spielberg s last attempt to spin a sci-fi tale, but at least it was ambitious and messy instead of sloppy and simple. Minority Report aspires to more than mere mindlessness, but fails miserably, and as a result crystallizes nearly everything that I dislike about Spielberg s films.",CBS_Doc9_MinorityReport,CBS,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority Report
89,CBS_Doc10_MinorityReport,"Based on the short story by Philip K. Dick, ""Minority Report"" marks the second futuristic, science-fiction epic Steven Spielberg has made in as many years (after what I believe to be his greatest achievement, ""A.I.: Artificial Intelligence""). For Spielberg, undeniably one of the most influential and visionary filmmakers of his time, the film almost seems tailor-made for his marvelous visual sense and stunning talent for storytelling. For all of its sweeping technical flourishes and seamless visual effects, however, ""Minority Report"" is as shallow and characteristically vacant as ""A.I."" was emotionally resonating and creatively groundbreaking. In other words, though it pains me to conclude, Steven Spielberg's latest opus is one of the weakest films he has made, to date.  Set in a surprisingly realistic vision of what Washington, D.C. might look like in 2054, John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the top detective on the police force's relatively new Pre-Crime Unit. Through three pre-cog oracles whose minds hold the key to the future, the Pre-Crime Force, headed by Director Burgess (Max Von Sydow), is able to stop predestined murders before they occur. The alleged success of the program has cut down on major crimes in D.C. by ninety percent.  When the latest murder suspect name comes up, Anderton is dismayed to learn that it is his own. Without never having met the victim before, Anderton is convinced that someone possibly federal agent Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell), who is after his job is trying to ruthlessly set him up. With the police suddenly after him, Anderton has no choice but to go on the run. Breaking into the Pre-Crime building, he kidnaps the most talented of the three pre-cogs, Agatha (Samantha Morton), convinced that what she knows about his future is the key to clearing his name and saving his life.  The general premise of ""Minority Report"" is a novel one, fascinating in the way the world has developed enough in fifty years that the police force has begun acting, more or less, as God to citizens. The moral implications of such a debate whether a person's future is predestined or capable of change are thought-provoking, to be sure, but get lost in a screenplay (credited to Scott Frank and Jon Cohen) more interested in action set-pieces, and a film that chooses style over any form of hard-edged substance. While several of the action scenes are astonishingly executed, including a death-defying jump across cars hovering in the air, and a search for John by electronic spiders sent to check the retinas of an apartment complex's tenants, what surrounds them is a thoroughly unsatisfying emptiness posing as a study of serious-minded issues.  Whatever deep-rooted involvement one might have grown to have in John Anderton's dire predicament proves sterile in a sea of blank faces posing as characters. Precious little is ever learned about John, except that he blames himself for his son's kidnapping six years ago, is separated from his wife (Kathryn Morris), and has a secret drug problem, and even fewer reasons are given for why we should like or care about him. Not being able to find the heart in John, or anyone else in this story, is one of Spielberg's most fatal missteps. Tom Cruise (2001's ""Vanilla Sky"") is not the greatest actor of his generation, but you can at least rely on him to lend credence to his roles. As fugitive John Anderton, Cruise is unusually stale and lifeless, closely matching Spielberg's unsteady take on the character.  The other actors are mirages posing as people. Colin Farrell (2002's ""Hart's War""), as the shady Danny Witwer, barely makes any impression until it is uncovered that his entire character has had no purpose but to be a clumsy red herring. Max Von Sydow (1998's ""What Dreams May Come""), as Pre-Crime Department head Burgess, is forced to bide his time appearing soft-spoken until his true colors are revealed. As pre-cog Agatha, Samantha Morton (1999's ""Sweet and Lowdown"") is the only performer to gain the viewer's sympathy, if only because you cannot help but feel sorry for the precious life she has lost. Morton is effective and focused, but she has little to do and even less to say. Everyone else, including the Pre-Crime officers, family members, and crime suspects, have non-existent dimensions.  Eternally grey-toned, Spielberg's stylistic choice to go for gloomy grittiness adds atmosphere to the proceedings, but the stringent absence of color or picture clarity from cinematographer Janusz Kaminski grows tedious after a while. The same goes for the progressively muddled plot developments, which have twisted and turned to such a degree by the finale that total convolution takes over. Cold, unmoving, and desperately in need of a beating heart and a soaring soul, ""Minority Report"" is one of the year's most depressing disappointments.",CBS_Doc10_MinorityReport,CBS,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority Report
160,AMB_Doc1_HappyGilmore,"In Happy Gilmore, Sandler plays the part of a determined hockey player who doesn't make the team but soon inadvertently discovers that his hockey skills translate very nicely onto the golf green. Until the point in the film where Happy begins playing golf, most of the laughs come from his misfortune (`Happy Gilmore  I called your name, didn't I?' [eagerly] `No, you didn't.' `Oh, well, better luck next year!!'), but it is the conflictive interaction between himself as a self-proclaimed hockey player and the much more formal and (for lack of a better word) high class game of golf that makes up the majority of the entertainment for the rest of the film. There is clearly a take on the classic odd-couple comedy structure here, as Sandler's vulgar hockey habits collide with the neatness and formality of the golf green, and for the most part, this comedy scheme works pretty well here. Sandler seems to adopt the character of Happy Gilmore with great relish as he displays violent acts of hilariously misplaced aggression, clearly foreshadowing his similar actions as Bobby Boucher in The Waterboy. Indeed, some of the funniest parts of the film come from his lengthy streams of profanity at the misbehaved ball when it doesn't go where he wants it to go (`PIECE!! OF!! MONKEY *beep*!!'). So you have an undeniably entertaining and amusing character who does undeniably funny things, but it is at the logical level that this film falls on its face. Luckily for the movie and for its fans, this is not the most important element of a movie like this. It's not very likely that a slob like Happy, who doesn't make the hockey team, is going to suddenly find himself bringing in thousands and thousands of dollars left and right, and stick to his plan to buy his grandmother's house back. You would think that, having seen that he can make that much money, he would at least have kept going for a while instead of quitting as soon as he had accumulated enough to buy back the house. A noble cause, obviously, but no red blooded American male on the planet is going to just quit the game because he prefers hockey or he hates his lead opponent. But who cares? Sandler delivers the steady stream of laughs as Gilmore with such skill that the comedy of the film far overshadows any such imperfections. Gilmore himself seems to be a bit overly violent in scenes where it doesn't seem entirely necessary, and there is clearly some overdone product placement, but it doesn't take away from the rest of the film. Mike Meyers made brilliant use of product placement in Wayne's World in such ways that added hugely to the comedy of the film (although he tripped over this technique in Austin Powers 2, when he made it massively over-emphasized and stonily unamusing), and the excessive violence of the Gilmore character is justified (although just barely) by the fact that his imperfect characteristics make his efforts (or lack thereof) to fit in with professional golfers even more amusing. As the pros stand around sipping expensive wine and discussing their respective accomplishments, Happy walks in asking where the pinball machine and the keg are. They want fame and recognition, he wants money and beer (and Virginia, the sexy reporter who fills the role of the obligatory love interest in the typical Sandler film). There are a lot of scenes in Happy Gilmore that, as much as I personally enjoy the movie, simply fall flat (many of which involve the homeless guy who Happy employs as his caddie, or the nutcase that Shooter McGavin employs to destroy Gilmore's chances of winning the tournament, or anything involving Chubbs' prosthetic hand) but the film succeeds where it is supposed to. Sandler presents Gilmore as a strangely likeable character, despite all of his destructive habits, and the film is peppered with other notable performances, not the least of which are by Carl Weathers as Chubbs, the former golf pro who takes upon himself the immense task of taming the wild Gilmore, and Christopher MacDonald, in yet another brilliantly hate-able role as the immutable Shooter McGavin. Happy Gilmore is a comedy from Adam Sandler, which means that you already know what kind of movie that you are going to get here, so don't complain if it turns out to be what you expected. Sandler does not make award-winning films, and chances are he never will, but the comedic value of Happy Gilmore is unquestionable. It is, to sum it up just as briefly as movies like this can be summed up, a perfect example of what I like to call Fast Food Cinema. It's a lot of fun, but there's no nutritional value.",AMB_Doc1_HappyGilmore,AMB,Comedy,Positive,Happy Gilmore
161,AMB_Doc2_HappyGilmore,"Golf is dreadfully boring. Thankfully, films like Caddyshack and Happy Gilmore posses ambition to bring fun to the green. Both are fresh ideas that use their actors to motivate their screenplay. Unfortunately, Happy Gilmore manages to drive itself into the high grass area shortly when the game commences. Let's watch  Happy Gilmore is often cited as ""Sandler's funniest film."" I'm not sure he has one. I recently did a fairly lengthy blog post on the subject of Sandler's films and tried my hardest to find the one that made me laugh and enjoy thoroughly. I'd probably say his best piece of work had to be Funny People. Was it funny? Not a whole lot, but it was enjoyable and a step in the right direction Sandler quickly abandoned. The story of Happy Gilmore is simple; a loud, energetic, aspiring hockey player of the same name takes up golf when he finds out he has a powerful swing. He has serious anger management issues, and because of that, somehow, he attracts the gorgeous Julie Bowen, who plays a Public Relations Director, and also, a fellow golf player named Shooter McGavin (McDonald) who wants Gilmore off the face of the golf world. What Gilmore desperately wants to accomplish is getting $270,000 so he can buy back his grandmother's house that was recently taken away by the IRS because of failure to meet tax payments over the last decade. There's the setup, compiled of the obligatory sports movie and love story clich s, but the main problem is, well, Sandler's character. The Happy Gilmore character is odd, annoying, and aggravating. This is what you call a film's desperate attempt at comedy. Gilmore is easily fatigued, which is why his character is seriously hard to like or side with. The character gets into fights every few minutes, resulting in lame, cartoonish blows to the face and also to Sandler's personal ego. It seems the film couldn't succeed in the writing portion and went immediately to the punching, kicking, ""things didn't go my way"" kind of slapstick. Keep in mind that if you read many of my reviews you'll know I am a fan of silly slapstick. It takes a certain mood and a very likable lead actor to pull off good slapstick. I wonder if Chris Farley could've brought more coherent likability to the Happy Gilmore character. Also, the product placement is shamefully explicit. I'm aware it's golf, and like every other sport, is known to display product placement around the field, but when doing it in a film it appears that some of the big name companies are put in for the money - not the realism of the source material. Especially the utterly shameless marketing for Subway. Have mercy. When compared to present day Adam Sandler, Happy Gilmore has a harmless innocence to it. It's not harmful in any way, except maybe your tolerance level. Sandler finds will be at home with this, while others will search the screenplay high and low for the real humor. But, the film does deliver laughs, just not consistently. There's nothing more uncomfortable than watching a comedy, that is supposed to be funny, but isn't. Happy Gilmore gets laughs, but a lot of them aren't distinct in any way. I think the most memorable scene is when Bob Barker and Happy Gilmore square off on the green. I think one of Barker's lines before the scene should've been ""humor, come on down!"" Starring: Adam Sandler, Julie Bowen, Christopher McDonald, and Carl Weathers.

162,AMB_Doc3_HappyGilmore,"This film is the one that introduced me to one of my favorite actors, Adam Sandler. His movies are mostly hit-or-miss gag machines, but this is one of his movies in which nearly every gag works. I almost miss the old Adam Sandler. The old Adam Sandler character would be a man who acts nice, but turns violent and angry when he doesn't get his way. Now he plays a mild-mannered every-man who makes little wisecracks. Not that the latter isn't funny, but the former is what he'll always be remembered for, and this is a perfect example of an Adam Sandler's true comedic side. Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) is a nearly unlikeable loser who after a strangely traumatic childhood, grew up to be a raving, anti-social lunatic, who happens to be obsessed with hockey. He constantly tries out for hockey teams, and proudly holds two league records (Most time spent in the penalty box, and he was the only person in history to ever take off his skate and try to stab somebody). One day, his girlfriend dumps him, he doesn't make the hockey team, and the IRS repossesses his grandmothers house which he grew up in. Soon, he discovers that he has an incredible talent for golf, with a record breaking long drive. Unwillingly taken under the wing of one-handed former golf pro Chubbs Peterson (Carl Weathers), and becomes a golf sensation due to his long drive, and extremely rude behavior, much to the dismay of the leading tour money winner, Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald). A bitter rivalry and a race-against-time ensue, as Happy tries to earn back his grandma's house, and beat Shooter. Happy Gilmore is a movie that I truly adore, and will always cherish. There are many quotable lines, and hilariously random scenes and/or characters. One of the funniest ones is a cameo by Ben Stiller as a cold-blooded orderly at an old folks home, who treats the citizens like inmates. One of the funniest comic bits in any Adam Sandler movie is the sequence in which Happy gets into a fistfight with Bob Barker, the host of ""The Price is Right."" For some reason, Bob fails to notice the heckler who's most frequently uttered word never fails to affect Happy's game for the worst. Another hilarious thing about this movie is how many of the characters in the movie manage to play their parts and keep a straight face, even when Happy is assaulting innocent people for the smallest reasons, and cussing out the golf ball when it won't go ""home."" Happy is one of a group of quirky characters in the film, but much of the humor comes from the reactions of the serious characters, and/or the extras when Happy does something stupid. One hilarious example of this is when Happy repeatedly screams out every word that can't be said on TV, well... on TV. The overall premise of the film is fun, and the film delivers non-stop laughs. Sit back and enjoy the classic Adam Sandler vehicle. I highly recommend this film, and give it 10/10. It is proudly rated PG-13 for Language and Comic Sexuality.

163,AMB_Doc4_HappyGilmore,"When he first assaulted America's senses by jumping from ""Saturday Night Live"" to the big screen, Adam Sandler didn't make much of an impression. He had his lowbrow fans, but many couldn't tell him apart from Rob Schneider or that guy from the Ernest Goes to Camp movies. Everything changed when Sandler made Punch-Drunk Love (2002) with writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson. Suddenly, it became clear that Sandler had soul; that he was capable of a great performance. So far his procedure had been to juxtapose his natural sweetness with an unholy rage. Anderson tapped into that and made it work in an organic and artistic way. So much so that Sandler has now made the leap from stupid comedies to year-end Oscar contenders like James L. Brooks' Spanglish. Universal has now re-released two early Sandler films -- Billy Madison (1995) and Happy Gilmore (1996) -- in a two-pack DVD set. And it's fascinating to go back and look at them with the fresh perspective of Sandler as a growing artist rather than as an obnoxious buffoon. Happy Gilmore is the more beloved of the two, notably for its scene on the golf course in which the lead character gets in a knock-down, drag-out fist fight with Bob Barker. The plot has Happy (Sandler) as a wannabe hockey player who tries and fails each year to make the professional league. With money tight, his grandmother (Frances Bay) loses her house and Happy has just so many days to raise the money to get it back. That's when he discovers that his slap shot works wonders on the golf course. A trainer (Carl Weathers) helps guide him through a series of tournaments. Of course, there's a bad guy (Christopher McDonald) and a cute girl (Julie Bowen), and we know where everything is going. But Happy Gilmore provides Sandler with a perfect outlet for his character. Around his grandmother, he displays not a shred of irony or meanness. Happy truly loves his dear sweet elder, and treats her with total respect. These scenes are offset by the golf course scenes, in which Sandler goes crazy with frustration over his terrible putting skills (who among the golfers out there hasn't?). The filmmakers behind Happy Gilmore don't find many surprises with this material and can't quite tie together Sandler's two sides, but it's a fascinating attempt, and very often, a funny one. Unfortunately, Billy Madison doesn't fare so well. Sandler begins the film by being overly obnoxious and fails to find a sweet side to balance it. In this film, he plays a spoiled rich brat who must go back to school to complete grades one through twelve to take over his father's company. As usual, a villain (Bradley Whitford) tries to stop him and a pretty girl (Bridgette Wilson) falls for him. These two films represent perfectly the rest of Sandler's career, which is spotted with total failures and partial successes, along with the one great film, Punch-Drunk Love. Sandler has recently turned 40, and so we hope that he leaves behind the juvenile junk and focuses more on the soul-searching.",AMB_Doc4_HappyGilmore,AMB,Comedy,Positive,Happy Gilmore
164,AMB_Doc5_HappyGilmore,"I have to admit something here: when I first saw Happy Gilmore back in the late 1990s, I was actually mildly surprised at how much I liked it, despite a weak beginning and some hit-and-miss spots.  Now seeing it again almost ten years later, I am actually surprised at how much of what I once liked about Sandler's most beloved comedy no longer appeals to me.  Perhaps it's a case of having low expectations the first time, while much higher the second time. Whatever the case may be, Happy Gilmore remains a fits-and-starts comedy that benefits from some clever Sandler moments, but it's just too irritating to recommend it to anyone that doesn't already consider himself a fan. Sandler (The Wedding Singer, The Waterboy) stars in the titular role, as a hotheaded aspiring hockey player that has a gift for powerful shots, but lacks the finesse to make the professional leagues.  When his grandmother's house is taken away by the IRS, it's up to Happy to get enough money to keep it.  He gets his opportunity when his long-drive skills merit him a spot on the latest golf tour, although his short game needs vast improving if he ever wants a chance to win the big dollars.  His antics on the course are a distraction to the other players and he is threatened with suspension if he should continue his childish tantrums, although he is bringing in big ratings to the sport that the sponsors and owners envy.  When his biggest rival, a hotshot golfer named Shooter McGavin, stands in the way of Happy and his continued success, Happy finds he must learn to be a true golfer if he wants to save the house, his face, and his sanity. Perhaps the real reason why Happy Gilmore has lost some of its luster in my eyes comes from the fact that Sandler has rarely been able to deviate from the man-child characters that made him a star to begin with.  Looking back at this one now, you feel like you aren't watching an individual film so much as one in a long series of dumb comedies that Sandler would star in.  If you've grown tired of Sandler's shtick like I have, you'll find that Happy Gilmore is just another in the formula Sandler films, espousing dumb humor, whiny characters, boyish personalities, and cheeseball 70s and 80s pop tunes. Before I go overboard in berating the film, I should mention that it isn't totally without laughs.  Most of the humor comes from the seeming randomness of the visual gags at times, where you shake your head and guffaw at how silly Sandler is wiling to go to inject laughs.  There's a great cameo from normally gentlemanly Bob Barker, a great foil in Christopher McDonald (Quiz Show, Breakin'), and the on-the-course golf action actually does manage to generate some excitement as things go down to the wire. Happy Gilmore is one of Sandler's better dumb comedies, although probably not as good as its reputation among his fans would have you believe.  It's fine for a few yuks and a mildly pleasant diversion, but I wouldn't go so far as to call this a must-see film, or even a good one for that matter.  Your enjoyment will greatly be determined by how you feel about Sandler in general. If by some chance, you've never been exposed to a Sandler comedy before, this is probably the lesser of all of his evils.",AMB_Doc5_HappyGilmore,AMB,Comedy,Negative,Happy Gilmore
165,AMB_Doc6_HappyGilmore,"""Happy Gilmore"" is a funny comedy; perhaps Sandler's finest (I know, it's not saying much, but...). Adam Sandler plays Happy Gilmore, an impulsive and crazy hockey player with a slight problem: He has absolutely no skill at hockey whatsoever. So after Chubbs (Carl Weathers)--an ex-golfer with a missing hand--sees Happy's slapshot, he immediately thinks that this will be it. He can give back to the golfing community. He's lost his hand, so he'll teach another person to become a pro. So Chubbs offers Happy a deal: Chubbs will coach Happy how to play golf at no cost. Happy refuses, until his ninety-something Grandma loses her home to the IRS. ""Why didn't you pay your bills?"" Happy asks her. ""Because,"" she says, ""I didn't have any money!"" So Happy looks into golf and realizes how much money one can make out of it. He immediately gets back to Chubbs and agrees to let Chubbs teach him how to play golf, in a last ditch effort to gain back his Grandma's home. So Happy takes his rough-life to the golf course and single-handedly dismantles what golfing is all about: He turns golf into a ""cool"" sport, instead of an ""old"" sport. He verbally assaults both caddies, spectators and golf balls, throws his golf clubs into the distance, dives under water in a pond to retrieve a missing golf ball, and tackles an alligator on a golf course. Yep, it's Sandler all right. And the best thing about Gilmore is that not only is he a TERRIFIC golf player, but the ratings on the television have gone up major points. Just as everything is starting to turn out for Happy, another problem wanders along. Evil golfer Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald) has purposely bought Grandma's house to tease Happy. So Shooter makes a deal with Happy that if he wins the final competition, he gets the house back. If he doesn't...he's pretty screwed. Adam Sandler isn't the greatest comedian in the world, but he is looked down on pretty fiercely by the elderly. I would feel sorry for him, but the younger crowds adore him; besides, it's hard to feel sorry for someone when they're single-handedly making fun of you and don't seem to care what you think. But regardless of Sandler's personal life and personality, he fit the persona of Happy Gilmore like a glove. I mean, really, who else do you expect to be shouting at people and throwing golf clubs about in a film like this? Exactly. Adam Sandler. There are a lot of stupid things in this movie, including the mandatory on-the-side-romance. But I must say, it's not as tragic as the romance in ""Billy Madison."" I couldn't help but feel the movie took the easy way out a few times, and kind of cheated the audience. For example: In one scene they are going over the ratings, and the ""main golf guy"" says the ratings are so high that they won't get rid of Gilmore. This is while a television is playing with Happy swearing and throwing golf clubs around. The golf administrators seem pretty pathetically shallow to just say, ""Hey, the rating's are up! He's a keeper!"" when Happy is doing that. This may sound like real-life marketing, but when you see the film, you'll know what I mean. Another thing is how almost everything and everyone other than the main characters are a bunch of shallow freaks. The movie plays a lot like ""Billy Madison"" in that sort of way. Many of the characters--other than Happy and the main cast--are shallow idiots. Unfortunately, sometimes this results in the audience being treated as an idiot as well. And then there are certain bits that are just too dumb, even for a slapstick of this measure. For example, in one scene, a maniac drives his car onto the golf course and runs over Happy. The way it is done os so over-the-top that you can't help but think, what were they thinking? But it's not a biggie: I don't go into films like these expecting an epic. I just wish they would put a bit more thought into it. ""Happy Gilmore"" may not be the most thoughtfully inventive film to come out of Hollywood in recent years, but that doesn't matter in a film like this. I go into a movie like ""Happy Gilmore"" looking for two things: One, some good laughs. Two: There is no two. I just want good laughs, plain and simple. And ""Happy Gilmore"" delivers that happily, no matter how much you hate Adam Sandler.",AMB_Doc6_HappyGilmore,AMB,Comedy,Positive,Happy Gilmore
166,AMB_Doc7_HappyGilmore,"Ever since he was a kid, all Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) ever wanted to do was play professional hockey. With the help of his father, he developed one hell of a slap shot, perhaps the most powerful the game has ever seen. But Happy isn t much of a skater  or a puck handler. And he has a hard time keeping his temper in check. So, every year, when he tries out for the team, he goes home disappointed. Adding to his troubles is the fact that the IRS has just put a lien on the house owned by his beloved grandmother (Frances Bay), who failed to pay taxes over a 10-year period (including penalties, the amount she owes is $275,000). In short, Happy needs money  and fast! It s at this point fate intervenes. Realizing he can convert his slap shot into a golf swing, Happy hangs out at a nearby course, hustling golfers by betting he can drive the ball farther than they can (and doing so each and every time, occasionally sending it flying over 400 yards). While taking his swings, Happy catches the eye of Chubbs Peterson (Carl Weathers), a former golf pro who was forced to give the sport up when an alligator bit off his hand. With Chubbs  help, Happy wins a local tournament, earning him a spot on the pro tour. Realizing his short game (putting, chipping, etc) isn t all it should be, Chubbs advises Happy to take six months off to sharpen his skills. But Happy needs money now, and with his towering drives, he captures the attention of the entire golf community, including Virginia (Julie Bowen), the pro tour s attractive public relations director. Unfortunately, he s also incurred the wrath of the sport s top player, Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald), who s none too happy to be playing second fiddle to an  amateur . Can Happy win enough money to save his grandmother s house, or will his short temper make him a laughing stock? As played by Sandler, Happy Gilmore is a very angry guy. Early on, we learn that his only claim to fame in the hockey world involved him removing his skate during a game, and then stabbing an opponent with it. We also get to witness a few of his tantrums first-hand (upon hearing that he didn t make the hockey team, Happy tackles the coach). Even on the golf course, he loses his temper quickly, shouting obscenities at the ball when he swings and misses on the opening tee. His outbursts, during which he attacks fellow players, throws equipment, and at one point threatens Shooter McGavin with a broken beer bottle, would seem shocking in almost any other movie. But Happy Gilmore stars Adam Sandler, an actor who has made a career out of playing likable louts. Sure, Happy sometimes crosses the line (in the film s most hilarious scene, he and game show host Bob Barker, appearing as himself, get into a knock-down-drag-out fistfight on the golf course), but Sandler s knack for bringing out the best in these sort of characters (due mostly to their basic, almost innocent approach to life s problems) shines through in each and every scene. We root for Happy, and hope that he somehow gets the better of the arrogant Shooter McGavin (wonderfully portrayed by Christopher McDonald), all the while realizing he s a guy who needs some serious anger management training. With its often funny, occasionally abrasive depiction of the world of professional golf, Happy Gilmore is an effective sports comedy as well as a showcase for its star, one of the few performers who can make audiences laugh at psychotic behavior.",AMB_Doc7_HappyGilmore,AMB,Comedy,Positive,Happy Gilmore
167,AMB_Doc8_HappyGilmore,"""Happy Gilmore"" tells the story of a violent sociopath. Since it's about golf, that makes it a comedy. The movie, the latest in the dumber and dumbest sweepstakes, stars Adam Sandler as a kid who only wants to play hockey. He hits the puck so hard he kills his father, who is in the act of filming a home movie. (Actually, he kills his father's camera, but it's a small point.) Happy can't skate very well, and when he's not chosen for the hockey team, he beats up the coach. Life seems to hold no future for him. After his father's death he is taken in by his beloved grandmother (Francis Bay), and then a crisis strikes: The IRS seizes Grandma's house and possessions. How can Happy possibly earn $275,000 to pay all of the back taxes? During a visit to a golf driving range, he discovers a hidden talent. He can hit the ball hundreds of yards, straight as an arrow. He's taken under the wing of a veteran golf pro named Chubbs (Carl Weathers) who tries to teach him the game, but it's Happy's tendency to explode and pound his clubs into the ground when he misses a shot. (Chubbs retired from the tour when a one-eyed alligator bit off his hand in a water trap; he is now forced to use a flimsy wooden hand, which he grasps with his real hand, which is clearly outlined beneath his shirt sleeve. No prizes for guessing that the alligator will turn up again.) Happy's long game is great but his short game stinks. He goes on the tour, where the defending champion, Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald), becomes his archenemy. They go mano a mano for weeks, in a series of golf scenes that are too heavy on golf for non-golfers, and too irrelevant to the ancient and honorable game for those who follow it. At a pro-Am tourney Happy teams with Bob Barker, whose fight scene seems longer in the preview trailer. The Happy Gilmore character is strange. I guess we are supposed to like him. He loves his old Grandma, and wins the heart of a pretty public relations lady (Julie Bowen) who tries to teach him to control his temper. Yet, as played by Sandler, he doesn't have a pleasing personality: He seems angry even when he's not supposed to be, and his habit of pounding everyone he dislikes is tiring in a PG-13 movie. At one point, he even knocks the bottom off a beer bottle and goes for Shooter. It was a Heineken's beer, I think. The label was a little torn. Maybe nobody paid for product placement. ""Happy Gilmore"" is filled with so many plugs it looks like a product placement sampler in search of a movie. I probably missed a few, but I counted Diet Pepsi, Pepsi, Pepsi Max, Subway sandwich shops, Budweiser (in bottles, cans, and Bud-dispensing helmets), Michelob, Visa cards, Bell Atlantic, AT&T, Sizzler, Wilson, Golf Digest, the ESPN sports network, and Top-Flite golf balls. I'm sure some of those got in by accident (the modern golf tour has ads plastered on everything but the grass), but I'm fairly sure Subway paid for placement, since they scored one Subway sandwich eaten outside a store, one date in a Subway store, one Subway soft drink container, two verbal mentions of Subway, one Subway commercial starring Happy, a Subway T-shirt, and a Subway golf bag. Halfway through the movie, I didn't know what I wanted more: laughs, or mustard.",AMB_Doc8_HappyGilmore,AMB,Comedy,Negative,Happy Gilmore
168,AMB_Doc9_HappyGilmore,"When it comes to golf comedies (not a very popular genre, apparently), the film residing at the dubious pinnacle is Rodney Dangerfield's Caddyshack. Happy Gilmore, the new release featuring Saturday Night Live alum Adam Sandler, tries gamely to attain Caddyshack's level. Alas, this picture just isn't on par with the passable 1980 farce. Sandler's movie is worth a few laughs, but not many of the comic sequences are original, and even fewer are inspired. I feel compelled to mention that this is undoubtedly Sandler's best outing to date. However, considering the quality of his other films -- Airheads, Mixed Nuts, and Billy Madison -- that's not an especially impressive statement. Nevertheless, despite the mediocrity of Happy Gilmore, it's apparent that Sandler has some aptitude for physical comedy, which puts him on a significantly higher plane than, say, Pauly Shore. Actually, one of the biggest problems with Happy Gilmore is that it pretends to have a plot. Sandler's comic skits would have worked better had they not been burdened by the silly, unnecessarily storyline that results in a lot of virtually intolerable tripe linking the funny parts together. And, during the film's numerous golf matches, why are we forced to endure Verne Lundquist's inane voiceovers as he provides TV coverage? Happy Gilmore starts off like The Cutting Edge on grass. Happy is a hockey player at heart, but, since he can't play his favorite sport (he's not a very good skater), he tries his luck at golf. One day, while bashing 400-foot drives at a driving range, the local pro (Carl Weathers) spots him and encourages him to enter a tournament. The lure of big money attracts Happy -- not because he's greedy, but because he needs $275,000 to buy back his grandmother's house from the U.S. government. Happy wins the tournament, and, as a result, joins the PGA tour, where he becomes an instant phenomenon. Along for the ride is a beautiful publicist (Julie Bowen), who becomes (surprise, surprise!) Happy's girlfriend; a haughty pro (Christopher McDonald), who is embarrassed by the presence of such an uncouth player on the tour; and a hulking fan (Richard Kiel, Jaws from The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker), who's always ready to jump to Happy's defense. Making cameos as themselves are Lee Trevino and Bob Barker. The latter provides one of the film's most-advertised moments as he gets into a nationally-televised brawl with Happy -- and wins. Product placement is out-of-control, with every corporation from AT&T to Pepsi getting a mention (each fake golf tournament is ""sponsored"" by a real company). In the most blatant motion picture advertising campaign since Sinbad hawked McDonalds in last year's Houseguest, Subway gets an interminable amount of screen time. A little product placement is usually inoffensive; taken to these extremes, however, it becomes distracting. Happy Gilmore could have been a lot funnier. As it is, at least it offers more to chuckle at than most of the dead-in-the-water ""comedies"" of early 1996. And, thankfully, we're spared the flatulence jokes that have become the staple of many similar films (Dumb and Dumber comes to mind). Nevertheless, irrespective of how many comic moments it provides, Happy Gilmore is still several strokes short of a respectable finish.",AMB_Doc9_HappyGilmore,AMB,Comedy,Negative,Happy Gilmore
169,AMB_Doc10_HappyGilmore,"""HAPPY GILMORE"" is a way-below-par golfing comedy meant as a showcase for Adam Sandler, ex-performer on ""Saturday Night Live"" - three words that ought to strike terror in the hearts of moviegoers. The comic high point comes when Sandler gets into a fistfight with grinning TV icon Bob Barker. Imagine the rest of the picture: Think in terms of nursing-home humor and prosthetic hands demolished by speeding trucks. Fisticuffs are part of Sandler's shtick, along with yelling and yammering, pratfalls and using his head as a battering ram. He's like the Iron Man side of John Belushi, the overgrown, indestructible kid who gets kicked and bashed and begs for more. That's pretty much the whole joke in ""Happy Gilmore,"" and it makes for a long 92 minutes.In ""Billy Madison,"" Sandler played a young man required to repeat his entire education, starting with first grade, to receive a huge inheritance. ""Happy Gilmore"" uses the same fish-out-of-water plot, with Sandler as the title character, a would-be hockey player who discovers he has an amazing gift for golf. The gimmick is that he drives the ball with a running start and a hockey-like swing that gives him monstrous distance off the tee. There's plenty of time to study his technique, because the picture shows it again and again. As this is a strictly by-the-numbers effort, it includes the requisite bad guy, the obnoxious, arrogant champion golfer (Christopher McDonald) who despises Sandler's working-stiff antics, and an at-first-reluctant love interest, the PR woman (Julie Bowen) for the tour Happy competes on. What brings Happy to golf? He needs quick money for his grandmother's IRS bill. (Scene: Grandma's house. Tax guy tells Happy the government must sell the old lady's home. Cut to shot of front lawn and tax guy flying out the closed window. That's what ""Happy Gilmore"" is all about.) Pity Carl Weathers, who has to try to make something of a role as a one-handed golf pro (cue laugh track) whose wooden hand Happy keeps mangling. Ditto for Richard Kiel, who must play several scenes with a carpenter's nail protruding from his head. Faring better is Kevin Nealon (another SNLer), who has a mildly funny brief turn as a golfer spouting New Age-isms for Happy's benefit. Director Dennis Dugan, taking a cue from Sandler's in-your-face style, wastes no time on frivolities like finesse or restraint. In a 1994 interview, after asserting that he likes ""idiot characters,"" Sandler cited as a major comic influence the movie ""Caddyshack."" Like ""Happy Gilmore,"" that was an SNL-based golf comedy (Chevy Chase, Bill Murray) that took a disdainful attitude toward the country club set. As dumb as ""Caddyshack"" was, though, it seems like George Bernard Shaw compared to this poor stepchild. Back to stand-up, Adam Sandler.",AMB_Doc10_HappyGilmore,AMB,Comedy,Negative,Happy Gilmore

120,TPD_Doc1_Fresh," Hopefully it will make for a good story , Noa (Edgar-Jones) tells best friend Mollie (Gibbs), as she psychs herself up for another first date full of awkward small talk, casual misogyny and ick-inducing sartorial choices. It s a required approach in the world of modern dating, where fearing for your safety feels as common as falling in love, and sometimes all you can hope for is an awful experience that makes for an entertaining anecdote. That s certainly what Noa gets when she falls for smooth-talking, self-deprecating, non-social-media-using surgeon Steve (Stan), finding herself   to use Mollie s word    dickmatised  into going on a surprise weekend trip with him after only a couple of dates, and finding out what he really means when he says:  I don t eat animals . Fresh is a film of two halves, built around a rug-pull for the ages (and an exceedingly gratifying delayed title sequence). The first act swiftly and effectively establishes Noa and Steve s connection, developed through brilliantly naturalistic chemistry and improvised banter between the two leads. Then, in a bold move reminiscent of Amy Dunne s  cool girl  monologue reveal in Gone Girl, the film shows its hand, spiralling into more gory, pulpy territory. It walks the line between unimaginable horror and knowing comedy with ease, much of which is achieved through Stan and Edgar-Jones  wholehearted commitment to both the tenderness and theatrics needed to buy in to all aspects of the plot. Stan in particular is having a ball, unleashing the kind of unhinged energy we ve seen most recently from him in Pam & Tommy, and Edgar-Jones manages to make Noa s reaction to an extraordinary situation completely believable, giving her enough edge and dimension to evolve the character way beyond a simple scream queen. Mimi Cave s impressive first-time feature direction is also crucial to striking that genre-spanning tone, weaving in operatic, fantastical sequences with blunt cuts and scoreless action; her camera starts out fairly static, but shots swooping overhead and upside-down sneak in as Noa becomes more disoriented. Even before the big reveal, extreme close-ups on gnashing teeth, superbly edited meat montages and the increased volume of gulps and chews evoke a sense of sticky nausea, and the soundtrack s consistent stream of  80s bangers, poppy tunes and more classic instrumentals only enhances the emotional rollercoaster. It s not perfect; a device involving Noa talking through a wall is clunky and unnecessary, Mollie feels underdeveloped and tropey at times, and it could be argued that the change of pace half an hour in is risky, and results in a loss of tension. The script s  independent woman  moments and dating-related cynicism can be a little on-the-nose as well, as is the allegory around the ownership and objectification of female bodies. But if you don t take that element too seriously, and allow yourself to get swept along in the heightened absurdity of it all, Fresh is an eye-widening, stomach-churning, violent delight. It s as subtle as a sledgehammer, but Fresh s audacious storytelling, full-throated performances and accomplished direction make for a tasty, wildly entertaining concoction.

122,TPD_Doc3_Fresh,"I don t much care for dating hell movies. You know, the ones where nice women go to Gethsemane and back to find Mr. Right and end up with Mr. Wrong, experiencing humiliation, torture, and new, horrifying ways to use kitchen appliances. But a thing called Fresh takes the genre one step beyond acceptance, combining sex, romance, and cannibalism. Call it Fifty Shades of Grey with Tabasco sauce. Sebastian Stan, one of the small handful of current screen heartthrobs who can legitimately lay claim to the label  handsome, clean-cut, Nautilus-trained hunk , has been turning in solid performances for a few years, beginning with an outstanding starring role in the Broadway revival of Picnic and continuing with high praise as disgraced figure skater Tonya Harding  controversial husband in I, Tonya. In Fresh, he tackles a different kind of assignment, as a fiendish doctor with a yen for seducing beautiful girls with his magnetic personality and witty, intelligent line of bull. Gets  em every time, but little do they know what they re in for after they hit the Porthault sheets. Like Jamie Dorman in the sexy Three Shades trilogy, Dr. Steve is rich, well dressed, and a perfect catch. Meeting innocently by chance in a grocery store, smart, lovely Noa (wildly appealing newcomer Daisy Edgar-Jones) is impressed by his ambition( he claims to be doing an internship in reconstructive surgery, which, in California guarantees a lucrative future) and the things they share (they both hate the superficialities of the modern dating scene). He doesn t believe in sex on the first date, which makes her respect him even more, so after they get to know each other better, they re off to a romantic weekend in the country together. Everything jells so peacefully that Noa can t believe her luck, and neither can we. So far it s a smart, clever little love story not exactly original, but not without its undeniable charms, either. Crash! When things turn, the movie hits its stride with the force of a terrifying gale that strikes in the middle of an otherwise placid summer. When Noa wakes up, she s chained to the floor in handcuffs; even the delicious gourmet meals in bed are part of a diabolical scheme to prepare her for unspeakable things to come. The man of her dreams is actually an accomplished surgeon with a deep psychological passion for gourmet meals of human organs. Nothing is as it seems. The doctor even has a wife, but when she disrobes to show she only has one leg, you begin to wonder if she plays an important role as her husband s sous-chef. There are other girls crying out from adjoining cells who are awaiting similar fates, but when Noa fights back, Dr. Steve takes revenge for losing her trust and begins performing little surgeries, beginning with her tasty derriere. Mayhem ensues with guns, knives, sharp car keys, shovels, and everything in the kitchen cabinet. Eventually she asks him what human flesh tastes like.  Well,  he says, carefully,  it depends on where it comes from and how it s prepared but if it s done right, it s fucking exquisite. It s like nothing you ve ever had before.  In plot twists I found increasingly disgusting, Noa joins the feast and shows signs of a special fondness for the doctor s pate with garlic and rosemary, a Blue Plate dish saved for special occasions, like brutal homicides. To relieve the growing nausea, there are occasional interjections of humor in the screenplay by Lauryn Kahn that seem both inappropriate and ill-timed in all the wrong places. (Girl in the next cell on the other side of Noa s wall:  How s your ass?  Noa:  Still gone.  But although it s a sick and depraved menu, director Mimi Cave s direction, for the most part, strives to be different and succeeds. The freshest thing about Fresh is Daisy Edgar-Jones, a uniquely intriguing actress with a big range of emotions, a natural talent, a bountiful gift of expression and a fascinating way of saying things in ways that are entirely unexpected. Sebastian Stan is a surprisingly adept co-star, macabre but perversely intriguing. He savors every bite of his insane culinary creations, but Hannibal Lecter wouldn t care much for the appetizers.

124,TPD_Doc5_Fresh,"You don t need a master s degree in horror to know how regularly and thoughtlessly movies subject women s bodies to the rule of men. It s refreshing, then, to witness a new wave of bold female-directed horror movies that have effectively flipped the male gaze on its head while conveying the discomfort of violence against women, from Coralie Fargeat s Revenge to Julia Ducournau s Titane to Dasha Nekrasova s The Scary of Sixty-First. Mimi Cave s Fresh aims for a similar kind of genre corrective through a brazenly black comic allegory in which women are viewed as literally nothing more than meat to be consumed, except its tone-deaf cheekiness only results in a feeling of dreary regression. Cave and screenwriter Lauryn Kahn waste no time in comically illustrating the misogynistic hellscape that is the contemporary cisgender dating scene. As Fresh begins, its meek and lonely protagonist Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) is out on a date with a blustery, scarf-wearing bro named Chad (Brett Dier). Truly living up to his name, Chad derogatorily comments on Noa s outfit while launching into a diatribe about how women don t dress sexy enough anymore, before also finding time to throw some racist barbs at the server at the Chinese restaurant where they re eating. Akin to a sketch comedy s take on a bad date, the scene makes valid observations but glosses over the more quietly insidious tactics that men regularly use to domineer women in favor of milking surface-level humor from ordinary douchebaggery. The night comes to an abrupt close when Noa diplomatically tells Chad that they re not a good match and he responds by calling her a stuck-up bitch and walking away. Noa seems ready to resign herself to a life without love, but then along comes plastic surgeon Steve (Sebastian Stan), whom she encounters at the grocery store in a meet-cute that feels too good to be true. He s charming and awkwardly funny (he approaches her by clumsily opining about how cotton candy grapes actually taste like cotton candy), with a boyish sheepishness that instantly disarms her state of despondence. They go on a couple of dates and as Noa begins to fall for him, Steve suggests a spur-of-the-moment getaway to the picturesque woodland region of Cottage Grove.  It s a straight girl s fantasy,  Noa s friend Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs) mockingly tells her before Noa throws caution to the wind and accepts the invitation. Dr. Steve is, of course, hiding something in this case that he s a black-market human flesh trafficker who kidnaps women to sell their meat as a delicacy for exorbitant prices. This reveal comes around Fresh s half-hour mark and shouldn t be too much of a surprise considering Steve s suspiciously anonymous nature (for one, the doctor isn t on social media) and anxious line of questioning during date number two about whether Noa has told anyone about him. Consequently, Noa is drugged and chained up in Steve s basement, alongside a couple of other women who she can only hear through the walls, primed to be gradually dismembered all while being kept alive for as long as possible, as that s how the meat stays, you know, fresh. The film s audacious conceit is to play Noa s predicament as zany comedy. This is epitomized most garishly by Steve s sudden transformation into a cartoonish psycho surgeon who dances around to  80s music while maiming his victims, pausing to enthusiastically offer quips like,  Relax! I m a doctor!  Stan, whose performance is all intolerable mugging, and the filmmakers are clearly having a ball with this streak of lunacy, but to what end, exactly? Cave and Kahn satirically position Noa s situation as a logical extension of the aggressions that women face on the regular while navigating the dating scene. When Noa first wakes up inside Steve s basement prison, panicked and confused, the film s response is to sardonically shrug its shoulders while essentially proclaiming,  Bad boyfriends, amirite?!  In theory, this is a gutsy proposition, but the filmmakers seem more preoccupied with slotting in the next snazzy cover of a retro pop song on the soundtrack than in daring to make the thematic connections that would pull this kind of tricky tonal balance off. Despite what Cave and Kahn appear to be signalling, Steve isn t just another typical bad boyfriend experience writ large he s a calculated serial abductor and murderer. This could have been a jumping-off point to truly probe the thorny parallels between bad men like Chad and bad men like Steve. But the filmmakers opt instead run through the familiar plot beats of countless captivity stories once Steve s true nature is revealed. The grating pitch of wackiness, then, doesn t so much radically upend tired genre tropes than it provides a facile distraction from a trudge through a story that plays out exactly as expected, with the ensuing sequences of grotty gore-laden violence staged with a fashionable indifference. At one point, Fresh does try and approach a level of introspection on the nature of female victimhood when Noa bemoans her stupidity for getting into this situation. One of the other captives responds by assuring her that,  It s not our fault, it s always theirs,  a steely rallying cry against victim-blaming and a forewarning of an eventual uprising. But when Steve s captives fight back, it feels less like a cathartic explosion of female rage than a joylessly de rigeur example of how these types of movies regularly culminate. This last-ditch show of weaponized femininity also doesn t quite deflect from one nagging fact: that instead of triumphantly subverting the male gaze of exploitation cinema, Fresh has been carelessly appropriating all of that gaze s worst predilections toward callous shock value.",TPD_Doc5_Fresh,TPD,Horror,Negative,Fresh
125,TPD_Doc6_Fresh,"Modern dating can be hell. Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) knows this firsthand as she seems to swipe right on nothing but losers. Then she bumps into the charming Steve (Sebastian Stan) at a grocery store. The adorable meet-cute sets up a recipe for love until Noa discovers Steve harbors unusual appetites that will challenge her survival. Fresh takes a literal approach to the meat market woes of modern dating, though it s more familiar and tonally uneven than its title implies. The title card takes roughly forty minutes to arrive in director Mimi Cave s feature debut, written by Lauryn Kahn. Up until this point, Fresh plays like a charming rom-com that highlights its most significant strength in leads Edgar-Jones and Stan. There s an easy chemistry between the pair, making their characters winsome straightaway. Cave also takes the time to present just how nightmarish it is on the dating scene long before Noa falls into true terror. The affable and seemingly grounded Steve is a rare diamond in the rough compared to previous matches. Once the truth about Steve gets unveiled, Fresh shifts into a promising horror-comedy that puts its lead in the same conversation as the likes of Patrick Bateman. But despite a few key moments that allow Stan to cut loose, pun intended, Cave struggles with tone. The pitch-black humor only occasionally enters the equation, and, despite the delicious premise, the horror gets too restrained. Keeping so much earnest focus on Noa, who in turn keeps her emotions guarded, means that her long game in plotting a way out of her predicament contradicts and undermines many attempts at humor. Emphasis on long; the pacing starts to sag in the second act as a methodical psychological game plays out, and the stakes seem to diminish. Supporting characters defy logic for the sake of the plot, putting themselves in harm s way despite knowing better. It all builds to a messy and familiar finale. Even still, the allegorical messaging still works, even if heavy-handed, and much of that belongs to just how much we root for Noa. Edgar-Jones makes for one endearing protagonist, and her brand of vulnerability offers up an atypical horror heroine that s infectious. She holds her own impressively against Stan s charisma, which somehow creates a sense of cheery optimism despite his character s carnivorous, dastardly red flags. He sells Fresh s intent and messaging, even in its narrative shortcomings. While the tone and story threaten to fall through Cave s grasp, the direction and stylistic flourishes shine. Especially when it comes to food, there s an elegance on display that would make the likes of gourmand Hannibal Lecter nod in approval. The core concept and stellar leads make Fresh a fun enough time, though it overstays its welcome by revisiting its metaphors instead of deepening them. The reluctance to fully embrace its horror and humor lessens its impact. In the end, this charming meat-cute whets your appetite with a delectable first course of allegory, style, and great characters. But it leaves you unsatiated when it comes to horror or the lively pitch-black humor it sporadically teases.",TPD_Doc6_Fresh,TPD,Horror,Negative,Fresh
126,TPD_Doc7_Fresh,"The moral of this story is that it s a bad idea to date anyone you meet in the supermarket produce aisle. The structure of Fresh is designed to mislead. The movie opens with a looooong prologue. Clocking in at about 30 minutes, it s intended to fool the viewer into thinking that he/she is watching a romantic melodrama. Excepting a briefly-flashed dick-pic, it might be something made for Lifetime TV. By the time the opening credits roll (at the aforementioned half-hour point), the movie has thoroughly fooled us into believing it s something it isn t. That s when screenwriter Lauryn Kahn and first-time director Mimi Cave pivot into a considerably darker and more gruesome alley. Frothy melodrama gives way to the Grand Guignol. The most surprising thing about Fresh is that, given the audacity of the concept, the filmmakers pull it off. The contrast between the banal normalcy of an ordinary person s life and the monstrosity of what s lurking just beneath the surface is evident not only in the performance of Sebastian Stan but in the camerawork and set design. The movie exists at the intersection of different worlds and genres: rom-com bleeding into horror, the  1% of 1%  exploiting ordinary hard workers. Cave goes overboard with some of the close-ups and edits, but those are stylistic quibbles. The movie starts with a bad date that eventually leads to a grocery store meet-cute. Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) is fed up with dating. The guys she meets are creepy and she dislikes the artificiality of the getting-to-know-you phase. So when she encounters Steve (Sebastian Stan) in the produce section, she doesn t know what to make of him. He s funny, witty, and doesn t push too hard for her phone number (which she gives him after only a little prodding). A first date leads to a second and pretty soon they re in bed together and planning an impromptu getaway. Noa s best friend Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs) wonders whether Steve is too good to be true (she deems his lack of Social Media presence to be a  red flag ) but she s happy for her friend. During the vacation, Noa learns that Steve has a darker aspect a much darker aspect. It turns out that he s the middle man for an elite clientele of uber-wealthy cannibals who like their meat fresh. Since Steve shares their tastes and possesses the surgical skills necessary to butcher human bodies, he has become a key provider. He specializes in young women. Preferring those with no connections (no family, husbands, or steady boyfriends), he charms them, drugs them, and chains them in a secluded location, removing limbs and other body parts as necessary to fill various orders. Although Fresh contains serious elements and doesn t skimp on gore (we see several scenes of Steve at work), the tone is that of a black comedy. In some elements, the movie offers what could be perceived as a satirical riff on Fifty Shades of Grey, except in this case the handsome, wealthy man s secret is a little more intimidating than a little S&M. Although Sebastian Stan doesn t necessarily resemble Jamie Dornan (he s a closer match to a young Jack Lord), Daisy Edgar-Jones could be Dakota Johnson s younger sister. Character interaction between Noa and Steve represents one of the film s stronger aspects. Since the movie is mostly presented from Noa s perspective, we have insight into her feelings and understand when she s pretending. But Steve is an opaque puzzle. Even when he has a woman chained in his dungeon and has already performed surgery on her, he continues to converse as if they re simply hanging out. He tries to convince his victims to relax and accept their predicaments. The movie introduces a subplot involving his wife that is too truncated to be effective. (It feels like some of this material, which features French actress Charlotte Le Bon, might have ended up on the cutting room floor.) Certain plot elements call to mind Jennifer (daughter of David) Lynch s controversial 1993 feature, Boxing Helena, in which a surgeon amputated first the legs then the arms of the title character (played by a post-Twin Peaks Sherilyn Fenn). There s more than a little of that going on in Fresh and Cave ensures the movie earns its R-rating by showing some gruesome cutting, albeit with a tongue-in-cheek approach to the way in which these scenes are shot. The movie also has fun with the concept of the male hero arriving in the nick-of-time to save damsels in distress. The closer one looks, the more apparent it is that Fresh doesn t know the meaning of the term  sacred cow.  I don t for a moment believe the film has widespread, mainstream appeal (hence the decision of Disney-owned Searchlight Pictures to bypass theatrical distribution in favor of a Hulu premiere) but for those who enjoy stews that mix warped comedy with twisted horror, it hits the spot. And what s a little cannibalism between friends, after all?",TPD_Doc7_Fresh,TPD,Horror,Positive,Fresh
127,TPD_Doc8_Fresh,"With romance callously sliced up into right and left swipes, dating has long been an undignified concept in the online world. You could even call it a meat market sure, it s a clich d phrase, but what clich  isn t rooted in some truth? In debuting director Mimi Cave s entertaining and bonkers satirical horror  Fresh,  Noa knows all about the losers on the bland menu of her endless app scrolls it s understandable that she has lost her taste for kissing the frogs. Still, our modern West Coaster charismatically played by  Normal People  breakout Daisy Edgar-Jones refuses to give up optimism and puts herself out there courageously, scarf-wearing douche-y dudes be damned! It s through her sweet hopefulness that she passes on countless faux-cool profile photos during one such evening of mindless browsing, and reaches out to someone sporting a cute dog picture as his avatar. But what thanks does she get for her curiosity? Nothing, just a gross dick picture sent by your average creeper. We get introduced to Noa in a pitch-perfect opening scene during a horrendous date with one of those aforesaid scarf-wearers. A cheapskate ( Bring cash,  he reminds Noa before the date even takes place), Chad chews his noodles while spewing all sorts of stomach-churning vitriol.  You would look great in a dress,  he rudely tells the sweater-donned Noa, putting her down for not being into femininity  like the women of his parents  generation.  He insults their waitress with blatant racism. He feels entitled enough to grab all the leftovers, not hold the door for Noa (What happened to all that  parents  generation  talk?) and calls her a stuck-up bitch when his reach for a kiss doesn t get reciprocated. So can you really blame Noa for rapidly buying into the grand gestures of Sebastian Stan s traditional charmer Steve on the heels of this disastrous evening and falling to bed with him? You can t hey, it s the ever-appealing Stan we re talking about but you are allowed to raise a slight eyebrow when this practical woman completely trusts a perfect stranger she only just met at a supermarket aisle, by allowing him to whisk her away to a surprise weekend getaway to an unknown location. Thankfully, her droll, bisexual best-friend Mollie (a terrific Jojo T. Gibbs) who seems to have given up on men completely, has much sharper instincts. No social media footprint? Not even an Instagram page as someone who claims to be a plastic surgeon? To Mollie, these are all red flags. They will seem shady enough to the viewers too, thanks to Lauryn Kahn s zippy script and Cave s visual language that, in unison, suggest enough of an unease beneath Steve s casual allure. To the careful ear,  I don t eat animals  from his lips will ring one or two alarm bells. (Why not just say,  I m a vegetarian? ) Other clues will hint shades of this mystery man s unusual tastebuds, too. But it s not until the title card  Fresh  appears more than 30 minutes into the film that they will be spelled out for all their grotesqueness. (Speaking of late-emerging title cards, if  Drive My Car  was a bridge too far for you in that department, wait until  Fresh  sneakily asserts,  Hold my Old Fashioned! ). While the surprising twist from this point on is what s sickly fun about  Fresh,  it s near-impossible to talk about this movie without spoiling it to some degree. So read everything below at your own risk, knowing that your first-time experience with the film will be irreparably altered if you do so. Here it goes: Steve is in fact a cold-blooded liar as well as a cannibal, satisfying the needs of his ridiculously rich human-flesh-eating clientele by selling them processed female meat. Noa is just the latest one of his victims who has taken the bait. But something seems to be different about his approach to her, as she quickly learns through cell-to-cell inmate banter in the ruthless Bluebeard s dungeon. He seems to actually like Noa, and maybe there is a way for her to use her infectious smile and enchanting femininity to outsmart this serial killer. I m making it all sound a lot more serious than it actually is. Know that the irresistibility of  Fresh  lies in the fact that it doesn t take itself too seriously all things considered, the film manages to stay light on its feet with its  Hostel  meets  Ex Machina  concept, mostly avoiding overt, self-righteous preachiness in its moderately-feminist tale where women s bodies are perishable commodity. In this regard, Cave and her cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski (a repeat Ari Aster collaborator) offer up a buffet of outlandishly gross but brightly lit visual tidbits of men savoring their pricey meals, keeping the mood nimble and wacky. Still, a huge part of the credit belongs to Stan, who goes all in on a maniacal performance that s often laugh-out-loud funny, even when the actor leans a bit heavily towards Christian Bale s  American Psycho  mannerisms on occasion. (Two fiendishly comical scenes accompanied by Peter Cetera s  Restless Heart  and Animotion s  Obsession  come to mind.) Gibbs is also the film s secret weapon while her character is dangerously close to a stock  supportive black best friend  on the page, Gibbs defies the clich s and claims Mollie as her own. Still, the interpretation of race in  Fresh  leaves a lot to be desired there is something to be said about a carelessly privileged white woman dragging her savvy black friend into harm s way. Also under-explored are the motivations of Charlotte Le Bon s Ann as Steve s wife (and possibly one of his former victims), this self-interest-focused white traitor clearly feels no responsibility towards her own gender, an idea that Kahn s script only vaguely teases and then abandons in its untidy (and increasingly gory) final act. But perhaps these are concerns for a meatier film. In the meantime, allow the tongue-in-cheek  Fresh  to satisfy your appetite for a generous helping of heartening sisterhood and eradicate your cravings for a juicy burger, possibly forever.",TPD_Doc8_Fresh,TPD,Horror,Positive,Fresh
128,TPD_Doc9_Fresh,"Modern dating is banal and dehumanizing. The most common way to do it is via app, where   in much the same way you d order chicken tenders for delivery   you pick from a bunch of options provided by an algorithm. You know that algorithm is likely to let you down, so you just hope it won t lead you to certain death. It s a boring, horrible way to think about people, at odds with the fundamental desire at the heart of dating: to be seen as a complete person by someone interested in you, and you in them. What s more likely is objectification: Dating apps encourage users to reduce each other down to parts. To meat. The indie horror movie Fresh takes that familiar metaphor to a particularly literal extreme. The debut film from director Mimi Cave and writer Lauryn Kahn follows Noa (Normal People s Daisy Edgar-Jones), a young woman in the throes of dating ennui, dating boring, ridiculous men who feel at liberty to comment on her appearance, want to ramble exclusively about their own interests, and then insult her when she isn t interested in a second date, much less first-date sex. Steve (the Marvel Cinematic Universe s Winter Soldier, Sebastian Stan) is different. Noa meets him in a grocery store   the first of the film s many delicious ironies. He s charming, clever, and not interested in pressuring her for sex. Even though she barely knows him, Noa decides to go on a weekend getaway with Steve after only a few blissful dates. This turns out to be a mistake when Steve drugs her and imprisons her, with the plan to keep her alive and slowly sell her body as meat to extremely wealthy clients who have developed a taste for cannibalism. In spite of that horrific premise, there s a comedic mean streak to Fresh that keeps it from getting too grotesque or grim   starting with the film s opening credits, which don t kick off until 30 minutes into the film, when Steve makes his move. Stan effortlessly pivots from charm to menace in that role, operating in a mode not that dissimilar from Penn Badgley as YOU s Joe Godlberg, albeit less sympathetic. Steve has been doing this to women for a long time. He s a fully formed amoral monster, but a charming one who dances as he works and likes to banter with his victim. As Noa s imprisonment continues, her captivity begins to take on the bizarre cadence of dating. That dynamic is Fresh at its horrific best: In the moments of ambiguity, when Noa, in a desperate bid for survival, starts to believe Steve is taking his time with her because he likes her, and she encourages him to think she might like him too   even suggesting they should start having dinner together, even if that dinner involves human flesh. Cave juxtaposes these scenes against moments of banal consumption. Other characters having normal, non-cannibal meals are shot with unsettling closeness and deafening sound, emphasizing the rip and tear of consumption, the way one life is masticated into nothing but selfish fuel for another life. Late in the film, Noa and Steve engage in a hypnotic, dreamlike dance that s played more to the camera than to each other, a scene that could be read as interrogating the viewer s own form of consumption   will we post a gif of it later? Strip it of its context and use it to fuel our own egos?

129,TPD_Doc10_Fresh,"Sebastian Stan plays an entrepreneurial serial killer in Fresh, trolling for solitary women on the dating scene whom he kidnaps and holds captive, keeping them alive for as long as possible, while harvesting their flesh for a network of wealthy cannibals. Even worse, he s the kind of foodie who insists on watching someone consume the dish he cooked for them and informing them of how much the ingredients cost. In the film s best scene, Stan s character, Steve, pushes a plate of pasta topped with a single murderous meatball toward Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones), the film s heroine, while holding forth on his personal journey into starting a monstrous meal-kit service as an instrumental version of  Exit Music (for a Film)  plays. It s a facsimile of a bad date, where one party drones on about their interests and the other gets in the occasional question, only Noa is in chains, and before she takes a bite, she feels obliged to ask if the meat is her own. Fresh is the directorial debut of Mimi Cave and was written by Ibiza s Lauryn Kahn (a former assistant of Adam McKay s, who is one of the producers), and it s never as daring as it is in that particular sequence, when Noa plasters on a smile and opens her mouth because playing along is her best chance at getting away. The film, which premiered at Sundance in January, is a horror comedy, though its horror is never gnarly enough and its comedy doesn t have enough teeth (rim shot!). What it does have going for it is a tremendously enjoyable Stan, whose razor-sharp jawline is outlandish enough to read as funny when it needs to, and who plays Steve as a West Coast answer to Patrick Bateman, a well-dressed professional with high-end taste, corny taste in music, and a smile handsome enough to obscure the coldness of his eyes. Steve and Noa have a meet-cute in a supermarket one night, and he s disarmingly fumbling, lacing his self-deprecating flirtations with mentions of the family members he is headed to visit. Noa, worn out from the apps, allows herself to believe that she has actually met someone worthwhile the old-fashioned way. And Steve turns out to be an ideal suitor, at least at first. They share intimacies over cocktails and fall into bed together, but only after he takes a moment to ask if they re going too fast ( I don t think I ve ever heard a guy say that before,  Noa marvels). He s a doctor. He owns a luxuriously appointed modernist house in the hills. He doesn t think it s too soon for them to spend the weekend together   in fact, he plans a getaway for them that turns out to be fateful. If Fresh had more of a satirical edge, it might have lingered in this space a while longer, devoting more time to the weariness that leaves Noa so ready to let her guard down and buy into Steve s suspicious perfection. But despite a title sequence that arrives a leisurely half hour in, right around the time that both we and Noa realize something s wrong, Fresh is more in a hurry to get to the cannibalism captivity than it is interested in the nightmare that is the Los Angeles dating scene or its main character s battered but uncrushed idealism when it comes to romance. Like a lot of movies these days, Fresh feels like it was conceived through its themes first and then written to bolster those ideas, rather than from the perspective of character or story. Its feminism is bold-faced and unexamined, with the film taking a late swipe at women who are complicit in the subjugation of other women, while never acknowledging the kind of woman who gets to occupy a higher place in the hierarchy of Steve s victims, and who gets regarded as potentially more than just meat. There s equally little awareness shown in giving Noa a devoted Black best friend, Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs), whose existence seems to only involve dispensing advice and support ( My emotional dependence ain t cheap, boo!  she declares early on). Edgar-Jones, of Normal People, acquits herself well as a final-girl type who refuses to be the only one left standing. But the film is so careful with her, as though it is as invested in her wispy vulnerability as its villain comes to be. When the time arrives for her to sacrifice a part of her body to Fresh s gruesome premise, Steve cheerfully tells her,  I m taking your ass,  in a sequence that s practically restrained in its staging. The movie is willing to dabble in gore, so long as it doesn t leave its heroine with any visible wounds.",TPD_Doc10_Fresh,TPD,Horror,Negative,Fresh

The movie opens with family photos of the two hanging out during Jason s childhood, so you know they used to be tight; in present day, Grandpa s just been widowed and Jason is a totally uptight dweeb with a hectoring fiancee (Julianne Hough) and a dull life. Grandpa engineers a road trip. He wants to go to Boca Raton, just as he has done every other year at this time, and he insists Jason must drive him to Florida. But the old guy has an agenda. Gramps knows that under that uptight exterior, Jason is still a free spirit. He doesn t want Jason to settle for a dull life and the wrong wife, and he knows that he can set Jason free with enough booze, drugs, parties and nubile coeds. Instead of going to Boca Raton, he manipulates Jason into driving to Daytona Beach, where young women in bikinis frolic in slow motion. This is a grandpa who thinks nothing of putting a few Xanax into Jason s beer, so Jason will chill out. Come on   everyone knows date rape drugs are funny! This is a movie that offers Robert De Niro masturbating to porn as its hilarious opening salvo. Then, because granddad and Jason are in a pink car, De Niro gets to deliver a string of tampon and vagina jokes about the vehicle. It goes downhill from there. If you squint, you could maybe see a Colin Quinn or a Billy Bob Thornton pulling off this role, not that either is old enough   provided the whole thing were recast, rewritten and directed by someone else   but it just makes no sense for De Niro. As for the rest of the cast, you know how actors such as Colin Quinn and Dave Attell and Tilda Swinton floated through the movie Trainwreck, and their characters made sense in the story, and it was seamless and hilarious? That s exactly what doesn t happen in Dirty Grandpa. Jason Mantzoukas turns up as a stoner, Parks and Recreation s Mo Collins is a wiseacre cop, Adam Pally is an idiot psycho cousin and Aubrey Plaza is a dense nympho undergrad   actually, Aubrey Plaza may be the only amusing character in the whole thing. The rest stick out like sore thumbs, not through any fault of their own. Dirty Grandpa relies on the just-in-case approach to storytelling. The movie concerns a grandfather and his grandson and the importance of their relationship. But just in case that s not enough, it s also a road movie, a buddy film, a spring break romp, a romantic comedy, a stoner laff riot, a mistaken identity farce, a feel-good family dramedy and a sexist, racist, ageist, weirdo, macho, patriotic jambalaya, with gramps proving to have been an important Green Beret in the past. Sorry, we re confused   is gramps a hero or a hilarious old perv? Talk about hedging your bets.

31,XCK_Doc2_DirtyGrandpa,"The would-be comic conceit of a foul-mouthed old person is, at this point, only slightly younger than the ability to depict foul-mouthed characters in cinema. The fact that anyone would consider this sort of character a shocking yet hilarious delight is almost inherently anti-comedic; it s hard to laugh from inside the deep depression caused by smug faux-edginess. Yet having acting legend Robert De Niro play a recently widowed and extremely foul-mouthed senior citizen basically the Johnny Knoxville role in Bad Grandpa minus the prosthetics and performance art is not necessarily the automatic travesty some would suggest. For one thing, De Niro can still bite into subpar dialogue with gusto, especially when he s given more profanities and vulgarities than he s uttered in years, maybe reaching back to the late  90s. For another, a movie like Dirty Grandpa where even the title is a ripoff of another movie gives a 72-year-old actor a starring role in a broad comedy. Would-be protectors of De Niro s legacy tend not to acknowledge the realities of remaining a working actor into old age, especially without resorting exclusively to character parts. It would be easier to defend De Niro s oft-underrated late-period work if he picked better raunchy comedies than this one. He plays Dick Kelly, a seemingly gentle old man who cajoles his lawyer grandson Jason (Zac Efron) into driving him down to Boca Raton. But when a reluctant Jason arrives to pick up his grandfather, he finds, yes, a foul-mouthed old person who wants to take full advantage of his newfound widower status by getting laid on spring break. Jason wants (or, in the style of the live-a-little buddy comedy, thinks he wants) to get back home to the demanding girlfriend he s marrying in a week. But when Jason and Dick bump into a group of college kids led by Jason s old acquaintance Shadia (Zoey Deutch, the latest actress tasked with pretending to find Efron-issued banter funny) and the sexually voracious Lenore (Aubrey Plaza), Dick insists on prolonging the trip. And the movie. Director Dan Mazer has written for a variety of Sacha Baron Cohen projects, and here seems to be aiming for a similar brand of mischievous shock comedy; Dirty Grandpa does go much further than fans of milder De Niro shenanigans like Last Vegas or Little Fockers might expect (if those fans do indeed exist). But Mazer isn t the credited screenwriter here, and basic tasks like a five-character dialogue scene (a mess of actor-dividing cuts) appear to keep him more than occupied. Even the basic work of assembling mock-dramatic close-ups in a party montage feels botched, barely keeping the characters in frame long enough for any visual gags to register, and rendering a simple drinking game weirdly hard to follow. Meanwhile, would-be shock bombs keep going off with deadening consistency. Screenwriter John Phillips attempts to invent memorably profane dialogue and piles on the poor-man s-Apatow insult-reference names, both with about a 10-percent success rate. He goes through these reference monikers so fast that two different characters refer to Efron as Terminator-like, once modified by  Mitt Romney  and once by  cockblocking.  If only the determination ascribed to Efron had any comic bite; he plays Jason with the same moist-eyed blandness he brings to romantic comedies or DJ dramas, miles from the winning riff on that persona he performed in Neighbors. Efron is supposed to have buddy chemistry with De Niro, but the only sparks in the movie come from De Niro s flirtation with Aubrey Plaza. More than anyone else in the cast, Plaza embraces the fact that she s playing a ridiculous construct issuing filthy, sometimes absurdist one-liners and rejoinders a non-character who might as well disappear in a puff of smoke every time she s out of frame. Plaza s seeming contempt for the project energizes her performance, and her scene partner; she and De Niro appear ready to run away together into a better movie.Apart from Plaza, the movie is funniest when portraying Florida as a lawless dirtbag playground. This is only a minor thread, though; the filmmakers seem more eager to give Dick permission to gay-bash and use racial slurs through a series of mostly inexplicable and unfunny plot turns. While Mazer and Phillips focus on these convolutions, the movie s stupid mistakes pile up. Some are minor but persistent, like the way photography enthusiasts Jason and Shadia speak reverently of Time magazine when it seems like they actually mean Life. Others are more distracting, like a weird, sloppy time compression that has heavy wedding planning, an actual wedding, spring break, and college graduation all taking place within a single week in March. All of the worst bits a cartoonishly villainous fianc e, Jason s clumsily developed interest in photography, Dick s apparent invincibility come together for an insanely drawn-out wedding-disruption scene so agonizingly long and terribly blocked that it almost works as experimental parody. That incompetence combined with the occasional burst of disreputable laughter makes Dirty Grandpa oddly lively for a movie that s largely terrible. There s a certain perverse brilliance, however accidental, to a movie that creates a longing for a foulmouthed Aubrey Plaza/Robert De Niro romcom.",XCK_Doc2_DirtyGrandpa,XCK,Comedy,Negative,Dirty Grandpa
32,XCK_Doc3_DirtyGrandpa,"When it s time to hand out laurels at the end of the year, early releases sometimes slip under the radar. So here s hoping that the January release of  Dirty Grandpa  doesn t prevent critics from remembering the film when they make up their Worst Movies of 2016 lists, because it is truly deserving. The film seems designed to see just how much further degradation Robert De Niro s legacy can take, and at this point, the actor might be as well known for his late-career backslide into increasingly distressing dreck as he is for his indelible, influential work of the 1970s and  80s. The funny thing is that he seems to be perfectly happy to do it. In  Dirty Grandpa,  it appears that screenwriter John Phillips opened Final Draft and typed as many expletives, words for genitalia and gross, unfunny brand-based puns as he could think of   several dozen times. With set pieces recycled from old episodes of  MTV s Spring Break  and the running themes of masculinity panic, homophobia, racial stereotypes and casual references to sexual assault (these couldn t, in fairness, be described as  jokes ), there you have  Dirty Grandpa.  The plot follows Richard (De Niro) as he hijacks his uptight grandson Jason (Zac Efron) to Daytona Beach, Fla., so he can party after his wife s death and talk Jason out of marrying the shrill Meredith (Julianne Hough). It goes without saying that the film is offensive, playing fast and loose with taboos such as the N-word, anti-Semitism, prison rape and child molestation, not to mention the treatment of women as mere orifices. But none of this is rendered in a particularly funny or novel way   just crude, shocking statements. Therefore, the film isn t actually offensive because it s trying so hard to be and failing miserably. Much of  Dirty Grandpa 's ire is directed at white males. Richard and everyone else constantly shame Jason for his slick, metrosexual/corporate lawyer life, with a continual gag referring to him as a  lesbian.  Efron submits gamely to the debasement, which often results in his nudity or an emasculating wardrobe. Directed by Dan Mazer, the filmmaking is sloppy. Most of the scenes make little sense. Day is suddenly night, photos appear on a camera mysteriously, characters contradict themselves. Punchlines don t land, and there s an overreliance on the trope of slow-motion walking to a cool song. And even that s not well executed. Bright spots are found in the supporting cast, though the less said about Aubrey Plaza s bizarre portrayal of horny, grandpa-fetishizing Lenore, the better. Hough is legitimately great as the marriage-obsessed control freak Meredith, a sort of female equivalent to the character played by Bradley Cooper in  Wedding Crashers.  Adam Pally is an always welcome presence. They just are not enough to pull  Dirty Grandpa  out of its ill-conceived and poorly executed gutter. Stay home and watch Harmony Korine s  Spring Breakers  instead.",XCK_Doc3_DirtyGrandpa,XCK,Comedy,Negative,Dirty Grandpa
33,XCK_Doc4_DirtyGrandpa,"In our review of last year s misguided Al Pacino vehicle, Danny Collins, we facetiously suggested that perhaps the reason its star and his equally-regarded contemporary, Robert De Niro, were churning out such consistent levels of dreck in recent years was the result of an inside joke between the two   a competition to see who could make the worst film. In whichever parallel universe such audience-trolling japery might exist, the release of Dirty Grandpa sees the contest unequivocally closed, a champion crowned. If there s a single positive to be taken away for those lamenting the post-millennial downward trajectory of De Niro s career choices, it s the knowledge that Dirty Grandpa represents rock bottom (sub-stratum, even) and that the next film we see him in will be   can only be   better. For now though, this is what we ve got: an insidiously misanthropic road-trip yarn, steeped in vile dudebro privilege masquerading as equal-opportunity offensiveness. Not a single character (or actor) escapes with a shred of dignity intact, as an alternately bored or bewildered Zac Efron accompanies his recently bereaved gramps on a skirt-chasing trip to Florida. With Efron playing the straight-man to De Niro s horny old toad, he s more often than not the butt of the  jokes    quite literally in a running gag that sees a grandfather stick his thumb up his grandson s arse at every given opportunity. The road trip itself begins with an extended shot of De Niro masturbating, continuing a strangely recurrent trope within the actor s comedies. What s the obsession filmmakers have with De Niro s junk? The Intern, The Big Wedding, Little Fockers   even 1900   all feature sequences that zero-in on his hard-on. Perhaps it s contractual? A last stand of virility as his more celebrated talents visibly deflate; his very own phallocentric Alamo? Yet it s difficult to feel too much sympathy for cinema s foremost Archbishop of Peru (see 2004 s The Bridge of San Luis Rey   actually, don t), given the vile dialogue he s made to spout. Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman s Bradley finds himself on the receiving end of one of De Niro s most repellent attacks: being black and gay apparently a gag in and of itself. Not that it s any better for the film s female characters, alternately reduced to sexpots (poor Aubrey Plaza), harridans or chaste, would-be girlfriends. A karaoke set-piece constructed entirely around De Niro dropping the n-bomb forms an echo chamber of bad judgement around all involved. Dan Mazer directs like a man in constant negotiation with an intemperate black hole, locking horns in a Sisyphean battle against a nation s entire tumbleweed stock; those inanimate De Niro-comedy groupies that tumble far to have their existential cries of purpose definitively answered. He s a long way from the smart satire of Borat, or the throwaway charms of I Give It A Year. The ugliest film in recent memory   in every sense of the word   we can only hope it meets the fate it deserves. Perhaps then De Niro will put some effort into getting his purported Scorsese project, The Irishman fast-tracked. God knows he needs it.",XCK_Doc4_DirtyGrandpa,XCK,Comedy,Negative,Dirty Grandpa
34,XCK_Doc5_DirtyGrandpa,"1. Dirty Grandpa is even worse than you think it is, and I bet you think it s pretty bad. There s no reason, inherently, that a movie called Dirty Grandpa, even one starring one of the greatest actors of our time, has to be bad. The idea that a comedy is supposed to have taste, that certain jokes should be beneath us, is wrong-headed and dismissive; all that is required of a joke is that it be funny. There is a way, in a theoretical universe, that a scene where Robert DeNiro masturbates on his couch while watching amateur porn involving elderly people could be funny. I don t know where this theoretical universe is, and I suspect I wouldn t want to live there, but it could exist. It requires set up, and dedication to the joke, and a cheerful willingness to take every comedic scenario to its logical extreme. It requires more than a half second of thought. Nothing in Dirty Grandpa appears to have been thought out any further than  what s the grossest thing we can have Robert DeNiro say right now?  It is depressing, sure, but not because of the style; it s all about the execution. I m probably kidding myself that Robert DeNiro sticking his penis in the face of a sleeping Zac Efron is ever a joke that could be executed properly. It s a joke that should probably be executed in the public square. 2. The plot of Dirty Grandpa is so thin that it appears to have been written on note cards that were thrown at the actors as they walked though each particular scene. DeNiro plays Dick Kelly, whose wife dies when the film begins; he requests that his grandson Jason (Efron) drive him from Georgia to Florida, for reasons I frankly don t remember and do not care to. Turns out, Grandpa just wants to get to Daytona Beach so he can have a lot of sex and take a lot of drugs. No real reason is given for this other than  it ll be funny to watch Robert DeNiro take a lot of drugs and curse and toss around millennial slang.  And let me tell you, reader, that is an awfully bad reason. Along the way, they come across a couple of spring breakers (Zoey Deutch the daughter of Lea Thompson, which made me feel sort of old and Aubrey Plaza, who I suspect initially thought she was signing up for a far different movie) and end up taking a lot of bong hits with their shirts off while drawing penises on each other s faces. I could go on with the plot summary here, but why put us both through that? 3. Where do I start here? DeNiro s Dick Kelly isn t a character so much as a constant spewer of  outrageousness,  the outlet of the screenwriters  desperate desire to offend everyone possible in the least inventive way. Kelly is sexist and homophobic and racist Dirty Grandpa actually has a  comedic  section about the n-word that made me want to crawl under my chair, and maybe even curl up and die down there but not in any sort of foundational, believable way. It s not a character trait, or something that makes any sense in context, or out of it. DeNiro is just a puppet through which the filmmakers funnel every wretched, gross joke they can come up with. That s depressing for DeNiro, but he gets no dispensation here: It s depressing to watch, too. This frat house humor can be done well, or at least better; I (sort of notoriously) can t stand the films of Seth MacFarlane, but at least his (nearly as bad) jokes take the form of jokes, with cadence and timing and the occasional set up. Here, DeNiro just spews and spews and spews, to no end other than to  shock.  If you are offended, you just don t get it. And all told, the movie can t even muster enough energy to rise to the level of offensiveness. I m reminded of that old Onion bit about Marilyn Manson going door-to-door screaming,  Look at me, suburban dung!  and bathing in pig s blood as residents take pity on him. Of course, it is one thing for Marilyn Manson to be the butt of that joke. It is quite another for Robert DeNiro to be.",XCK_Doc5_DirtyGrandpa,XCK,Comedy,Negative,Dirty Grandpa
35,XCK_Doc6_DirtyGrandpa,"Zac Efron and Robert De Niro band together for Dirty Grandpa, a not-so-buddy road trip movie that is sure to have you both laughing and wincing. With its no-holds-barred approach to comedy and the two leads great on-screen rapport, director Dan Mazer is able to offer up the perfect R-rated antidote to our cold and gloomy January's. Just don't expect anything that intellectually ground-breaking or moving... The film follows uptight and by-the-book, young lawyer Jason Kelly (Efron) who works at his stuffy father's film and is set to marry his over-bearing fianc e Meredith (Julianne Hough) in just over a week. Seeing that his grandson is soon to enter into a life of constant ""sleepwalking"" and being told what to do, Dick (De Niro) guilt-trips Jason into driving him to Florida for his annual holiday, in a last-ditch attempt to make Jason see sense and break free from his oppressed situation. His argument? That his late wife, and Jason's grandmother, would have wanted him to have kept up the tradition. However, Jason soon releases that his grandfather isn't the sweet, grieving man that he expected him to be, and is actually a foul-mouthed old guy who feels like he's missed out on the best years of his life and dreams of the day he can have some fun in the sack with well, anyone, to make up for lost time. Don't get it twisted though, Dick has some redeeming qualities. His sense of family is very much still intact and he remained completely faithful to his wife up until her final days. As if that's something we should praise him hero for, but heck, it kind of does make him a little endearing. During a pit stop on their travels, the pair run into Jason's old college friend Shadia (Zoey Deutch), who just so happened to be on his photography course   a subject he was very passionate about before he got unintentionally whisked away into the world of law. Shadia's accompanied by her friends: loose, sarcastic Lenore (Aubrey Plaza) who makes a sexual beeline for Dick, and their African-American gay friend Bradley, who swiftly becomes the butt of Dick's questionable teasing. The subjects of his barrage of mockery, we will let you assume. Lenore invites them to Daytona Beach to party and again, Dick convinces Jason to go along, and that's when the film finally picks up momentum and as expected spewing at chugging contests, public Flex-Off's, accidental drug-taking and nights in jail ensue... as you do. With Dirty Grandpa, absolutely anything goes when it comes to the opportunity of owning a gag, which is unsurprising given that it was directed by Borat writer Dan Mazer. A lot of the time, it's actually quite shocking how far both the script and the actors will take the joke, whether it be the up-close shot of a certain part of De Niro we can only hope is a prosthetic, a rapping Dick asking his new ""crew"" whether he can say the ""n-word"" or an awkwardly deadpan exchange between him and Lenore that depict in way too much explicit detail what they might do to each other if they ever go ""all the way"". It's common knowledge that De Niro has made his Hollywood name by playing brilliantly intimidating, or sometimes downright terrifying, tough guys in films such as Cape Fear, The Untouchables and Taxi Driver. Recently however, he's opted for somewhat ""cuter"" roles that are likely to reach a more modern and somewhat mainstream audience. Perhaps they even give him a slightly more impressive pay cheque at the end of it too. He's starred in movies like New Year's Eve, The Big Wedding or Nancy Meyer's latest picture The Intern, alongside Anne Hathaway, for example. But those who have grown to love his typical sweet, greying character, will not be greeted with him here. Dick is unlike anyone De Niro has played before, and while its incredibly uncomfortable to see him do it, he does do ""the leering and old but cool all the same guy"" well. Often with a movie as outrageous as this, it's all too easy for its stars to ham up their roles but each member seems decently cast. It's obvious that the film would not have worked so well if there had been no chemistry between Efron and De Niro and luckily, the pair have the stuff in abundance. Efron is never quite believable as the stuffy good guy, particularly as we saw him last in films such as Bad Neighbours and We Are Your Friends, but it's this sense of inner conflict over who he is that makes his character seem real. The supporting cast refuse to be overshadowed by the Hollywood heavyweights either, with actors such as Aubrey Plaza and Jason Mantzoukas, who plays stand-out character Tan Pam, consistently elevating the film to even weirder and more hilarious heights. It's fair to say, this film won't impress everyone. It's all too easy to criticise a movie like this one when you're in the midst of Oscar season and there are stunning, moving dramas everywhere you turn. But if the simple goal of a comedy is merely to entertain and make you laugh, then Dirty Grandpa more than succeeds. It might use questionable methods to get there, but it reaches its destination in the end with a surprisingly touching penultimate scene. Bet you never thought you'd see Parks And Recreation's Plaza gyrating on a cigar-smoking De Niro in a neon-lighted club on the big screen, now did you? Well, the time has come for you to face that somewhat terrifying, yet oddly hilarious, prospect.",XCK_Doc6_DirtyGrandpa,XCK,Comedy,Positive,Dirty Grandpa
36,XCK_Doc7_DirtyGrandpa,"When it works, it works   and, more often than not, Dirty Grandpa lands big, sometimes awkward laughs. While more Todd Phillips than Solondz, director Dan Mazer infuses the film with an uncomfortable sense of irony right up until its post-credit gag, which perhaps proves the shelf-life of a fetish might be longer than just a temporary phase. Those seeking the meaning of life ought to look elsewhere. The formula is familiar, while Zac Efron and Robert De Niro make an unexpectedly funny duo, with De Niro delivering zingers that would be inappropriate to mention on a site such as this. Efron plays Jason, a recent law-school grad marrying the uptight Meredith (Julianne Hough) with the approval of his equally uptight father, David (Dermot Mulroney). After his grandmother passes, his grandfather, Dick (DeNiro), begs his grandson to take him across state-lines to his condo in Boca Raton. Against, of course, the wishes of Meredith, the kind of white bread politician s wife in the making, Jason agrees to go, but   one of many catches   he can t take the SUV. He has to take her pink convertible. Dick transitions from the sweet, endearing old man into a horny man on a mission when he meets his match at random   Lenore, with Aubrey Plaza playing a parody of a sex-crazed college senior on the mission to complete a trifecta: student, alumni, professor   and she mistakenly thinks Dick is a professor. Lenore is a disturbed young women, and Plaza tests boundaries of decency as she confesses she lost her virginity at a Bingo hall and has a thing for older men. Cringe-inducing at times (Plaza s speciality), the film commits to the gag as Lenore and Dick commit to hook up. Along the way, Jason has an epiphany (after trying crack for the first time), falling for a member of Lenore s posse, Shadia (Zoey Deutch), also his former lab partner in photography class. Even corporate lawyers once had dreams   so of course Jason s perfect life is about to be shattered. The film progresses through a series of spring-break rivalries, parties, arrests, and encounters with a friendly local drug dealer in Daytona who will accidentally feed you crack. dirty grandpa zac efron robert de niro. The thing about Dirty Grandpa is many of the laughs are just plain wrong, testing the boundaries of jokes about child molestation and Lenore s daddy complex, coupled with a genuine parody of whiteness on occasion. Mazer is fully in control of this opus of madness   perhaps it takes an outsider (in this case a Brit) to make fun of white representation in cinema. When Shadia tells Jason he looks like Mitt Romney, he commits the ultimate party fowl of asking  who let the dogs out  at a party   a nod to Romney s uncomfortable photo-op with a group of black youth. Yet the film really is, in the end, overwhelmingly about dick and drug jokes   several land and, against my better judgement, I confess I laughed, and hard. Dirty Grandpa has a little more under the hood than your average stoner road trip sex comedy   testing the bounds of good and bad taste even as it reverts back to failure tropes of the genre. Still, it takes a few risks, even those that don t work; it s as creepy as its name suggests, sexist, and dirty-minded, but it delivers what it promises and commits. In the cinematic wasteland of January, Dirty Grandpa is a minor bright spot: perverse and subversive, if not somewhat predictable.",XCK_Doc7_DirtyGrandpa,XCK,Comedy,Positive,Dirty Grandpa
37,XCK_Doc8_DirtyGrandpa,"There's nothing clever about this deliberately rude and vulgar comedy, but certain audiences will find it absolutely hilarious. Never afraid to head straight into the cheapest, nastiest gag, director Dan Mazar and writer John Phillips throw their odd-couple stars into a series of riotously awkward situations, usually involving nudity. And even if it's not as funny as it ought to be, at least there's some meaning to the chaos. A film that requires you to embrace dark humor and everything politically incorrect, but in the end, a fun film. Zac Efron plays Jason, a bright young Atlanta lawyer who takes after his workaholic father (Dermot Mulroney). But Jason's grandfather Dick (Robert De Niro) remembers a more interesting Jason, before ruthless ambition took over his life. So after Grandma's funeral, Dick asks Jason to drive him down to Florida a week before Jason is due to marry the high-maintenance Meredith (Julianne Hough). Jason quickly discovers that Grandpa is intent on sowing some very wild oats, detouring their journey through Daytona at spring break, where they meet a couple of girls (Aubrey Plaza and Zoey Deutch) who are up for pretty much anything. What Jason doesn't know is that Grandpa is doing all of this to remind Jason who he really is, and to show him how to enjoy life instead of control it. The script sometimes lays on this message rather thickly in between a series of deliberately jaw-dropping gross-out sequences. Predictably, drugs and sex abound, and most of the jokes are so corny and ludicrous that they're not remotely believable. Everything that happens strains to shock the audience, which means that nothing is actually very shocking. But while the story has no tension at all, it also manages to grab hold of the audience simply because the characters are so vividly played by the fearless Efron and De Niro. Neither role is much of a stretch, but they dive into even the yucky and/or naked moments with gusto, developing some chemistry in the process. Annoyingly, Mazer misses the chance to inject even a hint of a blackly comical edge to the film, leaving everything feeling merely goofy. This gives the ace supporting cast little to do but try to steal their scenes (the hilarious Plaza walks off with the whole film). And it leaves even the genuinely funny scenes feeling rather pointless. Basically this is a movie for audiences who think that a penis is the most hilarious thing on earth. And they don't mind seeing a 72-year-old trying to take a 19-year-old to bed. This is certainly the kind of movie a serious film critic would never admit to laughing at.

38,XCK_Doc9_DirtyGrandpa,"When January rolls around, the cinemas are filled with a weird of critically-acclaimed award films and low-brow genre films that don t have even the smallest chance of winning any award. By the time I m seeing the movies in the mid-January slate, I m done with award films, having been watching them for the past three months in order to vote in various groups. So, when I start seeing the January movies (or at least the ones the studio has the stones to show us critics ahead of time), I actually am primed to enjoy them a little more. By this time of the year, I m tired of significant movies showing people s impossible struggles over adversity. I m ready for raunchy comedies and substandard horror flicks. In this context, a movie like  Dirty Grandpa  appeals to me more than it would were it released in a later timeframe. I know that  Dirty Grandpa  has nothing in it that is redeeming, honorable or respectable. It s a low-brow comedy that is going for cheap laughs. And while cheap laughs are worth what you pay for them, I actually enjoy some of them quite a bit. I ve said it before, and I ll say it again: I m a pig. It s okay to be a pig now and again. More over,  Dirty Grandpa  has done nothing to hide its true nature. No one should be blindsided by this movie s premise or delivery. It s all out there in the trailers and the posters. You shouldn t be expecting a tender characters study between grandson and grandfather. Instead, you should be expecting a ribald comedy in which Robert De Niro sticks his junk against Zac Efron s face while they re sleeping. About a month ago,  Sisters  opened as counter-programming against  Star Wars: The Force Awakens.  Though it was dwarfed by the latter in the box office,  Sisters  did well enough, and it went for similar low-brow laughs. At its heart,  Sisters  was an all-night house party movie with the twist of being about women in their 40s. Similarly,  Dirty Grandpa  is a spring break road trip movie with a guy who cashes a social security check every month. The story follows Jason (Zac Efron), an uptight lawyer, whose recently-widowed grandfather Dick (Robert De Niro) convinces him to drive him to Florida on the eve of his weeding. Soon, we learn Dick s real plan is to show Jason a good time in order to stop him from marrying his stuck-up, snobby fianc e (Julianne Hough). Not everything in this movie is funny, and the set-up takes a bit too long to play out. However, there are some moments that made me laugh, I ll admit. I enjoyed seeing De Niro play a different version of the foul-mouthed hothead (as opposed to the oodles of gangsters he s played over the years). I know there are plenty of people out there bemoaning De Niro s acting choices lately, but I have respect for the guy still having fun in front of the camera and taking some bolder choices. After all, last year he was quite good as the congenial older gentleman in Nancy Myers   The Intern.  (In fact, I d love to see a mash-up edit between that movie and this one.) Efron is fine in his role, but he s essentially playing the straight man to De Niro s hijinks. I m still not convinced the guy can headline a movie, and he does best surrounded by better performers (which is why  We Are Your Friends  was such a bust last year). To that extent, the supporting cast of  Dirty Grandpa  is quite good. Aubrey Plaza has a chance to be more of a sex symbol than the surly hipster she is usually typecast as, and Jason Mantzoukas essentially plays a version of his Raffi character from  The League  to provide additional comic release. It s not fine art. Heck, I m reluctant to call it art at all. But I will admit that  Dirty Grandpa  made me chuckle a few times.",XCK_Doc9_DirtyGrandpa,XCK,Comedy,Positive,Dirty Grandpa

In the week between his wife s funeral and his grandson s ill-advised nuptials, Dick (De Niro) hatches a plan: He demands that the groom-to-be drive him from their home in Atlanta to Daytona Beach so they can experience the carnal pleasures of spring break together. All of this invites comparisons to both Sideways (last-hurrah-before-a-wedding road trip) and Bad Grandpa (intergenerational male bonding), most of them unfavorable. A one-trick pony for its entire first act, Dan Mazer's raunchy comedy relies entirely on the tension between motormouth vulgarity (De Niro) and straight-laced propriety (Efron). The stunt-casting hijinks know no bounds, with Jason repeatedly alluding to his expertise in SEC compliance and LLC agreements (a bit that somehow gets funnier each time) while Dick performs a karaoke rendition of Ice Cube s  It Was a Good Day  to impress the college student he s hellbent on sleeping with (Plaza). Though many of these self-consciously crude jokes don t land, those that do are the life of the party. Late-era De Niro forever, y'all. It looked like just another crappy comedy. Robert De Niro has been in some of the greatest films of all time, but his modern comedies are mostly rubbish and include abominations like Little Fockers. As for wee Zac Efron, he s laughable when he s trying to be serious and the unfunny guy that comedians use to be funny in comedies. On its surface, Dirty Grandpa looked to be that tired set-up of simply an old person acting like they re not supposed to, being crass and therefore that s funny. The first reviews seemed to confirm this (for example, Deadline s The Worst Film Of Robert De Niro s Career (Or Maybe Anybody s)). Yet somehow, Dirty Grandpa is not just another crappy comedy. It s kind of a great comedy. The storyline is indeed weak and includes that cringe-worthy third act turn for the dramatic where the whole thing morphs into being about being true to yourself or some horseshit. But the majority of the gags hit their marks and hit them hard. I laughed more in this than I have in any Hollywood comedy for quite some time, mostly thanks to Dan Mazer s wickedly filthy script. In addition to the jokes, there s a lot to enjoy in Dirty Grandpa. There s a solid cameo by Danny Glover, kicked off with an awesome introduction involving TV show Alf. Then there s a Terminator reference, a Starship Troopers quote and an outstanding Andre the Giant anecdote. There s casual racism and homophobia played for laughs, but it s later rectified in a bizarre way, climaxing with De Niro saying the N-word(!). For all the time the film takes to smooth over that stuff, however, it is unapologetically sexist throughout. It s relentlessly low-brow, juvenile schoolboy humour and I feel somewhat guilty for enjoying it as much as I did. But it does what it does bloody well, De Niro and Aubrey Plaza in particular are great and I laughed my ass off.",XCK_Doc10_DirtyGrandpa,XCK,Comedy,Positive,Dirty Grandpa
