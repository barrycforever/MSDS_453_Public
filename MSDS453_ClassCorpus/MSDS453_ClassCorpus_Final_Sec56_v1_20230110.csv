CFA_Doc1_DespicableMe3,CFA,Comedy,Positive,Despicable Me 3,"It should come as no surprise that a movie franchise that depends almost entirely upon originality and freshness would start to feel more familiar and less fresh its third time around. As an admitted and unashamed fan of the Despicable Me and Minions universe, I have no problem admitting that this time around I found myself a little more frazzled than dazzled as we follow the heart-filled and humorous hijinks of Gru (Steve Carell) as he learns that he has a twin brother Dru, also voiced by Carell, while his new wife Lucy (Kristen Wiig) adjusts to the demands of playing mom to Agnes (Nev Scharrel), Edith (Dana Gaier), and Margo (Miranda Cosgrove).   Despicable Me 3 was one of my most anticipated films of summer 2017, an oddity perhaps for a professional film critic but there's something about these films that has tapped into my childlike sense of wonder and, logical or not, I absolutely love them. Well, to be honest, I didn't love Despicable Me 3. I liked it. I liked it a lot. It occasionally made me laugh and occasionally touched my heart, but it also felt like maybe, just maybe, the series is headed in the wrong direction and something needs to be done if this film's obviously open-ended closing is meant to lead us down the path to more Despicable Me films.   In the film, Gru is canned from the Anti-Villain League despite managing to protect the world's largest diamond but letting the world's most wanted criminal, former child star turned genuine baddie Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), get away to wreak havoc another day. You would think with Gru's endless supply of insecurities that the Anti-Villain League would have forced him into counseling by now, but this latest failure abandonment by his legion of Minions and a forced yet occasional journey through twindom that eventually leads to the inevitable attempt to reclaim the diamond and capture Bratt.   There is never a single moment when Despicable Me 3 really captures the magic that made us fall in love with this franchise, though co-writers Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio add depth to Lucy's character and manage to turn her into the mother we'd all really like to have. It's that warmth and sentimentality, at least in my opinion, that made us all fall in love with Despicable Me 3, a film that ultimately has always been about family values and family of choice. There's not enough of that genuine sincerity in Despicable Me 3, sentimentality often replaced by sarcasm and genuinely manifested humor often replaced by awkwardly forced set-ups and jokes that are funny but not funny like we expect from a Despicable Me 3 film.   While the presence of South Park co-creator Trey Parker is welcome here, Balthazar Bratt is a villain who wears out his welcome well before the film's 90-minute running time is up. With a tag line of ""I've been a bad boy!"" played out repeatedly, Bratt's presence begins to feel as awkwardly unsatisfying"
CFA_Doc2_DespicableMe3,CFA,Comedy,Positive,Despicable Me 3," Some animation features only have to answer one question: Do they make you laugh? Another one might be: Do they entertain you? And for the most part, I seem to recall finding Despicable Me and Despicable Me 2 fairly entertaining and funny, with the Minions spinoff less so on both counts. The story on any of these movies hardly matters, but the emphasis has tended to be about family, or at least the family to cobble together to help make you a better person. And over the course of the first two films, the supreme villain Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) has amassed a wife, Lucy (Kristen Wiig) and three daughters, who are all quite adorable. With Despicable Me 3, Gru adds a new member to his growing clan, a long-lost twin brother, Dru (also Carell), who he didn't even know about until this film. And when he confronts his mother (Julie Andrews) about it, she confesses that when she split from his father, each of them took one of the twins to raise.  Despicable Me 3 opens with what I guess is supposed to be a news piece about the growing threat of a villain named Balthazar Bratt ((South Park) creator and main vocal talent Trey Parker), a former child actor who played a character meant to be the worst kid in the world. But when his voice broke upon hitting puberty and he stopped being cute, he snapped, taking on the identity of the Bratt character and committing actual acts of evil, such as setting loose every-expanding bubble gum bubbles that push every person and building in its path out of the way violently. He also fancies himself a competitive dancer and insists on having any number of '80s pop tunes playing while he carries out his acts of destruction.  In an attempt to steal the world's biggest diamond, Bratt is thwarted (but not caught) by Gru and Lucy, but the new boss of the Anti-Villain League, Valerie Da Vinci (Jenny Slate), isn't happy that Bratt got away, and she fires them, leaving Gru with a lot of time to spend with his family. And then Dru enters to picture, with a full head of golden locks, dressed all in white, and just being generally agreeable and hugely successful. But the two get along splendidly and even being working together.   Photo courtesy of Universal Pictures But I know all you people care about are the damn Minions, who naturally return but in a slightly different capacity. Most of them assume that when Gru gets fired from the AVL that he'll return to his villainous roots. When he doesn't, many of them quit in protest, in the hopes of finding a better boss. When they aren't the stars of their own movie, the Minions are still very funny.  Many members of the key creative team behind the film have been working on these characters from the beginning. Director Pierre Coffin has had a hand in directing all three Despicable Me movies and Minions, second"
CFA_Doc3_DespicableMe3,CFA,Comedy,Positive,Despicable Me 3," Let's start this by saying, me and my kids wore our matching Minions underwear to see Despicable Me 3. We are the target market. And, superficially, it hit the mark. The wee people I was with liked it as evidenced by their near silence and unmovable sack-of-uselessness behavior during the film. If we're grading the movie on that, then A+.  This third window into the life of loveable curmudgeon, and mostly-reformed villain, Gru continues exploring its familiar themes: the meaning of family, non-biological parenthood, loyalty, and (surprisingly) nature vs. nurture.  First, I want to say I'm here for any movie that highlights that families can be made in so many ways. Gru is still a doting father to his three girls: Edith, Agnes, and Margo. His fatherhood isn't even a question. They are his girls and since the first movie my dude has been willing to risk his life for them. Lucy, however, is still trying to figure out what it means to be a (step)mom. We spent a fair amount of time in DM2 looking at what it means to be a kid who has never (to our knowledge) had a mother. And we ended that movie, of course, on the up note of Agnes reciting a poem about moms while Lucy fought back tears.  The biggest twist on family here, though, is the introduction of Dru, Gru's long lost twin brother. Who has hair. And is (kind of) evil. And has hair. Dru's desire to be as evil as Gru once was helps drive the plot as the brothers engage with Balthazar Bratt, the big bad in this installment. This child star turned adult villain brings humor and the necessary evil that Gru and Lucy must fight against. But so much more importantly, he's the reason/excuse for the soundtrack to be sprinkled with that 80s goodness.  What I would've liked more of from this movie was attention to plot detail. Yes, I know it's a kids' movie, but let's be honest: I'm going to end up watching it probably 50 more times once the DVD comes out. Dr. Nefario is conveniently sidelined without much explanation-but with nerd reference as a consolation prize. We don't get closure on what happens to the Bratt at the end. He's a villain, so we assume he's defeated. But maybe he's dead? Or maybe he escapes? There are a few other minor characters who don't have their plot points resolved, but we are left to assume everything worked out okay because of the genre.  What this movie did absolutely right was juggle storylines. We get Gru and Dru figuring out who they are as brothers and what that means. We get Agnes searching for mythical creatures. The minions are in these streets doing their own thing. Lucy is, as I said, working out the dynamics of being in a blended family. And we, of course, have the good vs. evil that leads the entire franchise.  Overall, this is a fun movie in a fun series. They definitely left the"
CFA_Doc4_DespicableMe3,CFA,Comedy,Positive,Despicable Me 3,"I'm confident that the minions would gleefully follow Chris Meledandri, Janet Healy and Chris Renaud anywhere this dazzlingly creative group would go!  In (Despicable Me 2,) Gru met his soul mate Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig) and they married. A quick roundup of the current (Despicable Me 3.) Now the reformed super-villain Gru (Steve Carell) agrees to change his life to make a better way for his three newly adopted daughters. And Gru discovers his long-lost twin brother, Dru, giving the reforming villain one more reason for a massive group hug!  Once the two long-lost brothers unite, this action-packed comedy moves swiftly into a hilarious family film that stresses those old-fashioned family values but in an utterly original way.  Old Gru has unfairly lost his job with the Anti-Villain League and his twin brother Dru desperately wants to get into the villainy racket to keep alive, we discover, the family legacy.  Gru and Dru are like table tennis players bouncing the running gags with speed and precision.  The villain making trouble is the disgruntled former child star named Balthazar Bratt (voiced by (South Park) co-creator Trey Parker)-a humorous relic of the '80s, when everyone knew and loved him from a show called (Evil Bratt.) Lost to his past, Balthazar wears huge shoulder pads and pump sneakers, tossing explosive bubble-gum bombs and break-dancing his way through complicated heists. He watches tapes of old episodes for ideas, corny but effective, and we get to hear his tagline-over and over again-(I've been a bad boy!)  Balthazar manages to steal the world's largest diamond and Gru and Lucy set out to stop him and to earn back the respect of new boss Valerie Da Vinci (Jenny Slate). While Gru and Dru make up for lost time and test out a slew of new gadgets that would make any villain proud, Lucy attempts to bond with the three little girls, who each have subplots of their own, the funniest being Agnes' obsession with finding a real live unicorn.  As silly and delightful as (Despicable Me 3) is, there are sentimental and warm-fuzzy family moments delivered with genuine sincerity. The true (Awwww) moments come when the youngest daughter Agnes tells adoptive mother Lucy, (I love you, Mom.)  The audience remains invested because the story keeps them glued. That's the work of writers Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul, who've been with the series since the beginning. This is complicated comedy, and for those of us who study structure, I suggest that you get a copy of the screenplay and pour yourself into learning their secrets.  (Despicable Me 3) is part of a franchise that has already earned more than $1.5 billion worldwide, and that's not counting merchandising or the (Minions) movie's additional billion. The uber intelligence of the team leaves this installment open-ended for an unending number of sequels. Jump up and down with glee. The minions will continue to bring the giggles for the next 50 years, I wager.  Along with the fast flowing jokes there is Heitor Pereira's spirited score and five new songs by Pharrell"
CFA_Doc5_DespicableMe3,CFA,Comedy,Positive,Despicable Me 3,"Full disclosure: I have seen neither Despicable Me nor Despicable Me 2, but the franchise's third installment kind of makes me want to. Now let me set the record straight: Despicable Me 3 is no crowning achievement in animation. You're not going to be wondering how they pulled off the effects. You're certainly not going to break down in tears once the credits roll. Simply put, it probably won't restore your faith in studio animation. But it may make you laugh.  Unlike so many of its peers, Despicable Me 3 is filled with clever humor that goes - if only a smidgen - deeper than your typical face-value gags and physical body humor that's so present in a majority of today's animated films. Steve Carell is mostly to thank for this, starring in the film as both ex-villain turned villain-catching agent, Gru, and quite hilariously, his twin brother, Dru. Kristen Wiig also manages to conjure up a few laughs as Gru's new wife attempting to learn the ways of motherhood via the duo's brood of adopted (and adorable) three daughters. As for the minions, I could take them or leave them. They'll make the kids laugh; they'll make you roll your eyes.  The story opens with Gru (Carell) and Lucy (Wiig) chasing down Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), the bubblegum-throwing, stuck-in-the-80s super villain who's been forever embittered by Hollywood for canceling the childhood sitcom he starred in. After Bratt escapes the scene, both Gru and Lucy are fired from the Anti-Villain League and attempt to begin a domestic life at home with their daughters Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier), and Agnes (Nev Scharrel), but it's not long before they embark on a new adventure meeting Gru's long-lost twin brother, Dru (Carell).  Plenty of laughs ensue as the brotherly duo endure an awkward introduction and come to be best buds, including an identity swap scene at the dinner table that achieves a level of stupidity one can't help but be amused by, also playing perfectly against Lucy and the daughters' complete and utter lack of enjoyment. More hilarity can be found as Gru and Dru go on to take down Bratt and Lucy adapts to mothering the three girls, accidentally pairing Margo with a native boy of Dru's island by forcing her to accept a slice of his cheese. Also worth mentioning is Agnes's search for a unicorn and the one-horned goat she ends up with instead. Like I said, this stuff isn't genius, but it is funny.  The film flails whenever it tries to be sentimental as there's little space for it in the comedy of errors that's happening. The storyline could've also been ironed out with more unpredictability, but how much can you really ask for out of an Illumination Entertainment production. After all, this is a film designed specifically for kids. The good news is, if you're forced to take your little ones to see this in theaters, you might actually have a few laughs. The bad news is, well, it is"
CFA_Doc6_DespicableMe3,CFA,Comedy,Negative,Despicable Me 3,"Once upon a time Gru (Steve Carrell) was a chrome-domed supervillain complete with minions, an evil genius assistant, a panda skin rug in his lair and a plan to shrink the moon but that was before Margo, Edith and Agnes three orphan girls forced him to rethink his diabolical dealings and become a family man.  The theme of family continued into (Despicable Me 2) which saw him as a doting single father working for the Anti Villain League with partner and love interest Agent Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig).  The family feel extends into the latest film, (Despicable Me 3.) As the story resumes Gru is fired from his job at the Anti-Villain League when he fails to apprehend thief (and former 80s child star) Balthazar Bratt ((South Park's) Trey Parker) following a daring diamond robbery.  With time on his hands Gru and family visit his long lost brother, the extravagantly accented Dru (also voiced by Carrell) in the far off island of Freedonia. (Shortly after you and your brother were born, your father and I divorced, and we each took one son,) explains Gru's mother (Julie Andrews). (Obviously, I got second pick.)  As the brothers bond, Bratt gets back to work, this time managing to steal the giant diamond. He plans to use the gem to power the giant robot and get his revenge. (This time Hollywood I cancel you and all the losers who rejected me!)  As if that wasn't enough plot, the Minions, the curious clan of yellow jellybean-shaped troublemakers who were once Gru's henchmen, are arrested after invading a TV talent show called (Sing!) As Dru convinces Gru to take another run at Bratt and steal back the diamond, however, the Minions escape jail and lend a hand.  (Despicable Me 3) isn't exactly just an excuse to trot out the million dollar Minions but it's hard to imagine what it would be like without them. Gru and Company are fun enough but three movies in, plus a Minion standalone, the human characters have become familiar, predictable. The real stars are the jellybean shaped minions who are still silly, inspired and just stupid enough to make kids laugh uncontrollably.  The animation is wild 'n wacky and there are several set pieces, like the henchmen singing Gilbert and Sullivan in Minionese, that are inventive but overall the film raises a smile when it is in silly mode but is less successful when it defaults to being a capital 'F' family film, which is far too often.  Adults of a certain age will enjoy Bratt's endless 80s homages-he even has an evil army called the Bratt Pack-but make no mistake, this movie belongs to Gru's brightly coloured little companions.  (Despicable Me 3) isn't terrible, but it doesn't have the spark of the other films in the series. That lack of spark is amplified by a blatant sequel-ready ending that suggests this is simply a set up to a further adventure; an appetizer for a main course yet to come. As such, instead of leaving me hungry for more it"
CFA_Doc7_DespicableMe3,CFA,Comedy,Negative,Despicable Me 3,"Over the past several years, Universal Pictures has been able to print money because of some characters you might have heard of: the Minions, those squatty, yellow, walking marshmallows with a penchant for jibber-jabber. Coming on the scene in 2010 in the animated film, Despicable Me, they are now all these years later found everywhere: on clothes, bedsheets, toy aisles, multiple apps, you name it. You might chalk them up as a fad, but if the worldwide box-office total for their namesake solo film in 2015 show anything (it's the second highest grossing animated film...OF ALL TIME), it's that we should expect to see these guys for many, many years...for better or worse.  A few months ago, I saw my first glimpse of Despicable Me 3 in its first trailer. My family laughed greatly. We see many children's films in theaters, so needless to say, we saw that commercial and the one to follow several times. I have liked each of the films, some of them quite a bit, but with this one riffing on the 1980s with its villain, Balthazar Bratt (voiced by Trey Parker), I was prepared for the best yet. If only the laughs could hold consistent to the trailers...if only.  Here, we follow everyone's favorite baddie-turned-goodie, Gru (Steve Carell), after he and his wife, Lucy (Kristen Wiig), are fired from their jobs with the Anti-Villain League when Bratt escape their attempts at capturing him after his botched diamond heist. I realize that it may be hard to remember that these movies are actually about more than just the Minions. Anyways, Gru experiences a bit of an existential crisis while unemployed, which isn't helped much by the earth-shattering news that he has a twin brother he never even knew existed. Apparently, Gru's parents divorced early on, and each took a son with them. It's all a lot for Gru to process, but that is helped by the enthusiasm felt in meeting Dru (also voiced by Carell). Dru just wants Gru to carry on the family legacy of villainy, and at this point in his life, what does Gru have to lose? They secretly team up for heist hijinks, because what would Lucy think if she knew? Meanwhile, the Minions (didn't think I'd forget them, right?) quit serving Gru in his moment of unemployment and strike out alone, but trouble always follows them, landing them in the slammer. Sure, there are more things going on in the plot, but I'll leave those for you to see.  Was it any good? I've seen worse kid's flicks, for sure, but there just wasn't a whole lot here to get excited about. The biggest problem was that some of the best laughs I've had already had for free in the trailers for months now. What was left unseen until watching the full film didn't really wow me. Sure, there was some zany fun in Bratt's brightly colored retro-themed tech and the musical cues, but none of the subplots in this film really amount to"
CFA_Doc8_DespicableMe3,CFA,Comedy,Negative,Despicable Me 3," In DESPICABLE ME 3, there's a moment when Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) mutters, (I miss the Minions.) Well, yes. So likely will most of the audience. Although the little yellow hench-beings are heavily promoted in the DESPICABLE ME 3 trailers, they are largely missing from this third entry in the animated series.  In the original 2010 DESPICABLE ME, Gru was a professional super-villain, supported by his mad scientist buddy and a horde of mischievous, banana-obsessed Minions. Three little orphan girls warmed Gru's heart, to the point where he stopped being a baddie and thwarted another despicable sort. In 2013's DESPICABLE ME 2, Gru met and married heroic super-spy Lucy (voiced by Kristen Wiig). Again, the adventures were aided (and sometimes derailed) by the Minions.  In DESPICABLE ME 3, written by Cinco Paul & Ken Daurio (who also penned the first two films), Gru and Lucy are both agents of a heroic worldwide organization that takes down villains. Unfortunately, Gru's latest failure to capture Balthazar Bratt (voiced by Trey Parker, of SOUTH PARK fame), results in him and Lucy being fired. Balthazar, an Eighties child star turned evil mastermind, dreams of destroying Hollywood, the town that turned its back on him. Meanwhile, Gru's long-lost twin brother Dru (also voiced by Carell) wants Gru to teach him the ways of villainy.  The Minions walk out on Gru early in the film, except for two who stick with him but don't do much. DESPICABLE ME 3 occasionally cuts back to the Minions. However, the movie plays very much as if the filmmakers decided that they had certain set pieces they wanted to include, couldn't figure out how to integrate them and decided not to try.  This means that we've got a lot of loose plotlines waving around. The Gru/Dru sibling stuff is mildly amusing, but not funny enough, visually or conceptually, to fill the screen time it gets. Lucy's desire to be a good mother seems valid enough, but the jokes and punchlines connected to this are extremely mild. Little Agnes (voiced by Nev Scharrel) is still fascinated by unicorns, but this also goes on for awhile with a minor payoff.  The real mystery here is why Bratt was conceived the way he is. YouTube notwithstanding, little kids may not get all the Eighties references, and adults who get the joke may feel that it wears out pretty quickly.  Even the Minions don't have as much impact as usual, though their musical numbers are worth watching. Some good ideas are formed around them - the notion of the Minions as a feared prison gang is pretty funny - but these play out so fleetingly that they don't pay off. Yes, brevity is the soul of wit, but when you have a concept with potential mileage involving your most popular characters, you might want to explore it a little more.  The best thing here, at least for Angelenos, may be the depiction of Hollywood Boulevard, which takes artistic license, but is nevertheless startling in how accurate it feels. It's like"
CFA_Doc9_DespicableMe3,CFA,Comedy,Negative,Despicable Me 3,"At what point to film series and franchises begin to lose their bite? Despicable Me 3 aims to answer that question and the result is not what the studio is anticipating.  In 2010, Illumination Entertainment stumbled upon a premise that would lift its stock to a point not far below the greats of Disney, Pixar, and DreamWorks. Their concept of an archvillain using children as pawns, but discovering a genuine affection for them was a novel concept in animation and the end result was a warm, sweet exploration of fatherhood and family.  Three years later, that film's immense popularity led to a continuation of the story where Gru (Steve Carell) falls in love with a secret agent (Kristen Wiig) while his family is threatened by the machinations of a new villainous threat. The film was a solid effort, but began showing signs of limited potential. Gru was turned into a good guy and his nefarious schemes felt like an ever-present, but modestly distant memory. The familial joy was there, but a bit diminished. It was enjoyable, but not as moving as the original.  They followed this with an ill-advised prequel based on the popular pill-shaped Minions of the first two films. These critters speak in a language only they can understand, but which the audience can pick up contextual and visual clues to comprehend. This slow-moving film was a decided downward collapse of the series and laid the groundwork for concern over its future.  Now we come to the fourth film of Illuminations bread-and-butter franchise and it is a direct continuance of the characters and storylines of the second film. This time out, Gru and Lucy are in pursuit of a former child star-turned-villain (Trey Parker) who has plotted to steal a massive pink diamond. To complicate matters, Gru discovers that he has a long-lost twin(ish) brother named Dru. Dru always wanted to be the supervillain Gru was, but had to satisfy himself with playing spy in his own mind and with the vast wealth his father left him.  As Dru and Gru explore their fraternal relationship, they must work together alongside Lucy to break into Balathazar Bratt's heavily-defended compound and retrieve the purloined gem while bonding in the process. Many antiquated tropes of the spy and thriller genre, such as the family-in-distress dynamic, are on full display here and the machismo that has permeated the series threatens to undermine the jovial and friendly atmosphere the series once reveled in.  Pierre Coffin, who has been a part of the production, directing, and writing team since the beginning, has been shepherding the franchise towards its massive box office takes and popular approval, he has seemingly forgotten what had made the original film so special. That sense of emotional and paternal growth felt genuine and irrepressible. Now, it feels gratuitous and inconsequential, tacked on to tie it into the previous films, but lacking the sincerity.  This fourth incarnation has lost its way. Paying lip service to its own origins and haphazardly connecting to the past films, it is thankfully"
CFA_Doc10_DespicableMe3,CFA,Comedy,Negative,Despicable Me 3,"So, Despicable Me 3, then. Why not, I guess. It was almost a given that this was going to be an improvement over the last film in the Despicaverse, 2015's utterly stagnant Minions. And it turns out to be at least a fractional improvement over 2013's Despicable Me 2, as well, for the same reason: less emphasis on the minions, and more on the actual characters who feel actual feelings. Not much more, necessarily. While the first Despicable Me remains at least slightly charming, thanks to its straightforward version of a well-worn story of a family being formed out of isolated loners, Despicable Me 3 has a much more half-assed approach to the same basic notion. But half an ass is better than none.  The film has three main plot strands. In one, supervillain-turned-secret agent Gru (Steve Carell) is fired right before he learns that he's had an identical twin brother all this time, named Dru, who looks and sounds identical, except for a luxurious crop of blond hair. Dru, a hapless failure compared to their supervillain father, manages to seduce Gru back into a life of crime-ish-ness, as they team up to steal back a huge diamond that was already stolen by yet another supervillain, '80s child star gone bad Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker). In a second, Gru's new wife Lucy (Kristen Wiig) tries to find her footing around his three adopted daughters, Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier), and Agnes (Nev Scharrel). In the third, the minions, who've staged a walk-out in annoyance that Gru just won't go back to being a proper bad guy, end up in prison. They sadly do not remain there.  The three plotlines intersect, but they really don't talk to each other; it's more like a mid-series episode of a routine sitcom, clumsily tossing storylines to all of the leads with no real concern that they need to be stitched together in a compelling way. The aesthetic detachment is palpable. I can't what say drives Pierre Coffin, co-director and what amounts to the keeper of the Despicable Me flame; if he has some hot-blooded passion for this utterly mediocre material like John Lasseter has for the Cars movies, but I can't convince myself that he does. Cars 3 is not an inspired movie by any definition I can plausibly come up with, but it does feel like somebody on the writing staff believed in it, however misguided that belief was. Despicable Me 3 feels like cold, hard product: assembled from purely mechanical logic for purely mechanical ends.  That certainly explains the glassy-eyed blandness of what I guess we should call the A-plot, Gru and Dru's awkward attempt to re-connect through high-tech crime: Gru the master villain trying to do good, Dru the hapless idiot trying to do bad. Only the fairly low-key spectacle of Carrel trotting out a similar-but-different voice for Dru (and, in one of the few scenes in the film that wrested a chuckle from me, Gru and Dru's impersonations of each other) offers"
ACB_Doc1_Grown Ups,ACB,Comedy,Positive,Grown Ups,"I know others didn't care for this movie, but I really enjoyed it. It just goes to show, not everyone likes the same things, and that's okay. I laughed throughout - almost like I was there with them.  When the beloved coach of their childhood champion basketball team passes away, 5 friends since youth come together with their families for the funeral. Each of them having taken very different roads to end up in different jobs and financial statuses. But, all of them still share the same background, same basic sense of humor and similar family problems. They're friends, and even after all these years, they don't miss a beat.  This isn't one of Adam Sandler's best movies, but it is one of his most down-to-earth and casual films. It really is like old friends hanging out together, joking around and having fun. It is this kind of humor, the kind you have when you're with your best friends and just enjoying the time together. On the strength of this comedy type is where this movie excels. It handles most of the subject matter realistically, with some over-the-top moments - ie: the breast pump scenes, and the hanging by your feet from a zip line at the water park (which, of course, they would never let you do), but that just adds to the overall feel. The various family dynamics are entertaining - for example, between Kurt McKenzie (Chris Rock) and his mother-in-law. And each actor brings his own brand of humor effectively to the screen.  I can't imagine that a lot of serious comedy fans anticipated this movie at first, given the cast of great comedy actors that weren't having the best of luck at the time! The great news is that Grown Ups, is old-school awesome, with a story right from several classics that made many a Saturday Night Live legend a comedy movie legend.  Five friends - Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, Rob Schneider and... holy crap, David Spade??? hear of the news that the man that influenced their childhoods the most, their basketball coach, has passed away.  After the funeral, they drag their families to a lakeside resort to relive old times, only to discover why they're not what they thought they'd turn out like and to do something about it.  For a family comedy, it's pretty damn hilariously rude at times, but what I love so much about it is the chemistry and camaraderie between the leads.  The dialogue is the backbone of about 50% of the movie, consisting of Sandler, James, Rock, Schneider and Spade seriously insulting each other while acting like old has-beens. It was very well written and I couldn't help but laugh out loud throughout, which I'm not used to.  The other 50%? Well that consists of belly-laugh inducing stunts, great cameos from the likes of Steve Buscemi and Tim Meadows and some seriously cringe-worthy laughs from wives Salma Hayek (rawrr), Maria Bello (rawrr), Maya Rudolph (huh???) and Joyce Van Patten (blerrghh).  If you don't like it, I'm betting"
ACB_Doc2_Grown Ups,ACB,Comedy,Positive,Grown Ups,"I went into this one wondering if the world needed another Adam Sandler man/child comedy.  Even with the worst of intentions or my only intention being that I meant to hate the movie, I have to admit it was better than expected.  Rats!  It ruined my pretty long streak of hating all Adam Sandler movies. I'm sure the streak will start again with his next one, but until then I guess I'm an Adam Sandler fan...groan... While in high school and playing on the basketball team Eric (Kevin James - from television's King of Queens), Marcus (David Spade - from television's Rules of Engagement), Lenny (Adam Sandler - 50 First Dates, The Waterboy), Rob (Rob Schneider - Deuce Bigelow: Male Gigolo, You Don't Mess With the Zohan), and Kurt (Chris Rock - Madagascar, The Longest Yard) they win the championship together at St. Mark's in 1978. Now 30 years later they all get a call that Coach Buzzer (Blake Clark - Toy Story 3, Leatherheads) has died.  They are still friends, but haven't seen each other for quite a while.  Lenny is a high profile movie producer, Kurt is a stay-at-home dad, Marcus is still single, Eric is the co-owner of a lawn furniture company, and Rob is a new age practitioner who is married to a much older woman (Joyce Van Patten - The Bad News Bears, Marley & Me).  Once they reunite at the funeral it is like no time has passed and they are teasing each other and joking continuously. Lenny has rented the cottage they used to stay at when they were young for the weekend for all five families to spend some time together.  The guys are not too happy when Lenny tells them he has to leave before the weekend is over to accompany his wife (Selma Hayek - Frida, Once Upon a Time in Mexico) to fashion week in Milan.  They convince him to stay long enough to spread Coach's ashes. Over the course of their time together the problems of each man comes out and the bond that was there 30 years ago proves itself to be just as strong.  And it spreads on to their families. Yes, the film is totally predictable, but there is something likeable about this type of silly little film.  Maybe it is because it does not pretend to be anything other than what it is.  It just wants to make the viewer laugh and does not aspire to want to bring about world peace.  Sandler and his buddies Chris Rock, Rob Schneider and David Spade allow newcomer to the group, Kevin James to tag along for the ride.  The plot is not too deep and the jokes are pretty superficial and through today's lens, occasionally offensive.  That being said, I laughed plenty and felt good after watching it.  That is the best thing you can expect from a film like this. There are times that you body"
ACB_Doc3_Grown Ups,ACB,Comedy,Positive,Grown Ups,"What can I say, I'm a sucker for all of these comics. The cast is hilarious and work well together in creating a brilliant dialogue. My only criticism about this movie is the lack of humor from the ladies. It would have been nice to have seen the women have strong jokes and not seem so amateur. They were kind of funny, but almost all of the funny lines were from the male actors. Rob Schneider, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Steve Buscemi, and finally Adam Sandler: you all are hilarious! 'Maize.' If it weren't for Rob Schneider's character this movie would not have been nearly as funny. With them bouncing off of each other with jokes about his wife, height, kids, etc and his toupee flying in the wind, it was side-splittingly funny. It seems like there was a lot of improv, which I love. I loved the connections between all of the characters, but I wish the 'game' would have been when they were in high school or later because the whole concept of them being 12 years old winning a game and being the privileged ones to spread the coach's ashes is a little far-fetched. All in all, if you enjoy raw comedy I highly recommend this movie. Every movie that Sandler produces just turns out to be a memorable comedy film. I had enjoyed every minute of this movie laughing. I have to admit the story wasn't clearly shown, but it felt like watching one of the best episode/season of a good comedy show. Every character was good from Adam Sandler to Rob S. This movie was defiantly better then Get Him or Bring him to the Greek, that movie was just nasty. IT was a family entertainer. Great movie to take the family, especially on a summer. I have no idea why so many people gave negative review on this film but I really did enjoy it. Everybody should go see this movie. I would defiantly recommend it for anyone who wants some laugh in their life. Rather than the straight up stupid humor with lack of well thought out jokes and plot line that most of the Hollywood companies have been puking out in the past five years (probably longer), ""Grown Ups"" kept me laughing through all 102 minutes. It has a solid plot line, morals (Well hidden, where I like them), characters who grow, as well as ones who don't, and a point to prove. With a large list of highly talented and well known comedians, the movie flows smoothly and sparks a source of entertainment for most any age group/interest. This comedy may bring back memories or remind you of some important family things.  If you are interested in and hour and forty-two minutes of laughing, smiling, reminiscing and remembering, please consider choosing this movie for your next night in. The acting is good. These actors always have been good entertainers. I liked the scenes between Rob Schneider and that old lady. Those were hysterical.  Overall,"
ACB_Doc4_Grown Ups,ACB,Comedy,Positive,Grown Ups,"""In (Grown Ups,) five childhood friends reunite after years apart to honor the memory of their recently deceased basketball coach.  We care, marginally, because they are played by (Saturday Night Live) alums and real-life pals Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, David Spade, Rob Schneider, and Kevin James (who wasn't on (SNL) with this crew but hopped aboard Sandler's gravy train with (I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry) and seems to be enjoying the ride).  And (Grown Ups,) to be fair, gets some mileage and earns its few laughs from the unforced chemistry shared between seasoned comics who grew up together, professionally speaking.  Comedians are a strange bunch. Naturally surly and instinctively defensive, they appear most comfortable when surrounded by other comics.  I love listening to the nationally syndicated satellite radio program, (The Opie and Anthony Show.) The hosts regularly invite vicious stand ups as guests, and the sharpest segments feature sarcastic comics like Jim Norton, Bill Burr, Patrice O'Neal, Louis C.K., Robert Kelly, Dane Cook, Rich Vos, or Jay Mohr shredding each other for the good of a joke.  Sandler and his co-stars possess that competitive camaraderie, and (Grown Ups) is at its funniest when the five friends are riffing on each other's weight, appearance, insecurities, and flaws. Some of the one-liners broken off by Rock, Sandler, and Spade, in particular, are very funny (and, by the looks of the genuine laughter in the cast, unscripted).  Dennis Dugan's film needed plenty more of those jokey interactions, and a lot less of the toilet humor that chokes away the cleverness and friendly atmosphere of the film's opening act. Not that I'm surprised. Bathroom jokes have always been Sandler's preference, and so James must urinate on Spade, Schneider has to get kicked in the balls (twice), and Maria Bello has to spray breast milk in Maya Rudolph's face. One running joke involves Schneider's character having sex with a woman old enough to be his grandmother. Another joke suggests Spade had sex with a dog. Not very grown up, is it?  That brings me to another point. (Grown Ups) continues Sandler's impressive streak of casting incredibly beautiful actresses as his love interests. This guy's track record is Hall of Fame worthy. On screen, he has dated or been married to Julie Bowen, Winona Ryder, Drew Barrymore, Marisa Tomei, Kate Beckinsale, Jessica Biel, Emmanuelle Chriqui and, currently, Salma Hayek. At least in (Grown Ups,) he spreads the wealth, so that Rock and James can play house with the lovely Rudolph and Bello, respectively.  "" Love this film. To me it seems exactly like how imagine a weekend get together with some old mates would be in the future. Just having a laugh, messing around, going to the places you used to go, etc.   I don't think jokes seem forced at all, just a bunch of mates taking the mick out of each other at every opportunity lol.   Great story line cracking little jokes and funny scenes. The actors were perfect in every way. I can't"
ACB_Doc5_Grown Ups,ACB,Comedy,Positive,Grown Ups,"Grown ups is a fun and relaxing comedy. I took my wife to see it and we both greatly enjoyed it. Now people may complain about this or that but if they do they miss the point the movie is trying to make. 1978 a group of friends playing basketball win the big Championship and the coach as a reward rents a beautiful cabin for all of them and their families to enjoy. The Coach makes a speech about how they should all approach life like they did this game and they will be winners champions with no regrets. flash forward 30 years later and each of them receives a phone call the coach is dead. They decide to rent the cabin and hold a reunion bringing their families with them and to try to introduce them to the magic of their childhood years and teenage years. Adam Sandler is a wealthy high powered Hollywood agent who just wants his kids to grow up to be normal and not spoiled. Chris Rock is a henpecked house husband who gets no respect from his business woman wife or his kids or his mother in law. Kevin James is a typical dad with a wife and kids and a weight problem his wife still breast feeds their 4 year old son and the magic has gone out of their life. Rob Schneider is a dramatic love them and leave them man except he loves the older ladies. David Spade is the single guy here and he's the drunken party animal. All of them have secrets and all of them feel like failures in one way or the other. But by the time this weekend is over secrets are revealed and friendships are restored and marriages are given back their magic. this movie does not promise the earth moon and the stars All it wants is for you to relax shut your brain off and park your worries in the lobby. It's not a laugh every scene or a laugh riot but it does have laughs and it is a nice lazy relaxing movie that we all need once in a while. I loved this movie and recommend it for what it is. If people take it too seriously then they missed it's point.  My husband and i just saw the movie yesterday and we laughed like crazy from start to finish! anyone who loves all of the other adam sandler movies just has to see this one as its way too funny! outstanding cast, awesome acting, we were wondering (why) anyone would give this awesome funny movie a bad review? you will walk away from this movie feeling great and with a smile on your face! outstanding actors that were in his previous movies and outstanding music too. its hard to find a really great movie these days and this one is simply outstanding and is what one would expect. a must see for the entire family. if you liked all the other"
ACB_Doc6_Grown Ups,ACB,Comedy,Negative,Grown Ups,"A film starring Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade and Rob Schneider has to be funny, right? Not only is that what the promotional material for Grown Ups wants moviegoers to think, but it also seems to have been what was on the minds of the members of this comedic powerhouse. Sit back, relax, do what you're told and hilarity magically ensues. Maybe in a dream, but this is reality and Grown Ups faces a harsh one. Back in the 70's coach Buzzer led Lenny, Eric, Kurt, Marcus and Rob to a basketball championship. Thirty years later, the boys have grown up and apart, but their coach's passing brings them back together again not only to remember good old coach Buzzer, but to spend a weekend together at the same lake house at which they celebrated their big win back in the day. Joining them on the excursion are their wives and children. Lenny (Sandler) is a hotshot Hollywood agent married to a fashion designer (Salma Hayek). They've got three kids, two tech-addicted boys and a little girl with a soft spot for injured animals. Eric (James) is married with two children, a girl prone to temper tantrums and a 48-month old boy who likes to indulge in mommy milk. Kurt (Rock) grew up to be the woman of the house, cleaning, cooking and looking after the kids while his pregnant wife (Maya Rudolph) takes care of business. Marcus (Spade) may have grown up physically, but he's still a bachelor with a college frat boy attitude while Rob (Schneider) took his childhood attraction to older woman to the max and married a grandma who shares his appreciation for all things natural and wholesome. And that's pretty much it. The plot is reduced to the whole coach-is-dead-let's-reunite thing and from there, pretty much just throws the guys and the family members together and lets them go about their not so amusing business. Had the gags been funny, they could only carry the film so far. At some point there needs to be some sort of story to latch on to, some sort of ending to be working towards, but neither ever comes. The gags go from goofing with the kids, to having a guy-only powwow, to talking about bunions and back again. It gets old, fast. Making matters worse, the jokes are painfully unfunny, so much so they're embarrassing to watch if not nauseating. Even worse? Nearly every gag is used and abused, over and over. A tyke still drinking mom's breast milk, Kurt's mother-in-law's relentless farting, Rob's unnaturally gorgeous daughters and a dog with an unusual bark is a guarantee at least every ten minutes. What's in between? Countless mean-spirited jabs at one another. The only way these friends know how to be funny is by going for the other's gut and in a film with zero heart, those jokes become more unappealing than the grotesque ones.

ACB_Doc7_Grown Ups,ACB,Comedy,Negative,Grown Ups,"Starring Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Kevin James, Rob Schneider, David Spade, Salma Hayek and Maria Bello. Directed by Dennis Dugan. 142 minutes. At major theatres. PG When rock stars grow old and fade, they often resort to touring with other has-been howlers, hoping each act will attract enough fans for a reasonable facsimile of an audience. It's much the same desperation that brings us what might just be the summer's worst movie, no small feat in a season already reeking of foul cinematic emissions. The film is Grown Ups, which has a title you must not equate with maturity. It features ((stars) is too generous) four Saturday Night Live alumni, all now firmly in their 40s, who used to be considered comedy gold: Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Rob Schneider and David Spade. The first three haven't had an unqualified hit in a while, and Spade has been MIA for so long, his role should be advertised on the side of milk cartons. Grown Ups also features one guy, Kevin James, who actually still has a viable career, on the strength of last year's surprise hit Mall Cop. James has evidently decided to risk his fragile popularity by engaging in this appalling mess with his fellow boy-men, which gets him points for loyalty if not for career smarts. The slim conceit of the picture is five pals from a 1978 school basketball championship team who reunite at a lake house 30 years later, their families in tow, following the funeral of their beloved coach.  This is a five-in-one deal you definitely want to refuse. Directed by obedient hack Dennis Dugan, Grown Ups comes from Sandler's ramshackle laugh factory, which wheezes out product even when no one is buying, as is increasingly the case.  It's evident that Sandler couldn't even be bothered to write the script he's credited to having penned with Joe Dirt scribe Fred Wolf. No discernible effort went into the assembling of this witless series of juvenile and frequently offensive gags, which are set against an insipid soundtrack of cut-rate pop ditties ((The Pina Colada Song,) anyone?) Three general rules were obviously in effect on this Boyz 'R' Us movie set: (a) Any joke that entered anyone's head would be used, no matter how old, lame or gross it might be; (b) no topics, especially sexist and racist ones, would be considered off-limits; and (c) any gag, once belched or farted out, would be repeated numerous times, until even the most tolerant viewer would feel like screaming, as Schneider's character does at one point, (Grow up, will ya!) Schneider's character, cleverly called Rob, plays the closest thing to an adult amongst these stooges, which isn't saying much. He's become a New Ager, embracing the Earth, vegan food and a devoted wife who is significantly older than him (the indulgent Joyce Van Patten). Sandler is Lenny, a Hollywood super agent with a fashionista spouse (Salma Hayek), incredibly bratty kids and the usual Sandler mugging, minus any hilarity. Rock is henpecked househusband Kurt, who is bullied by his pregnant wife"
ACB_Doc8_Grown Ups,ACB,Comedy,Negative,Grown Ups,"Adam Sandler spends more time laughing at jokes than making them in Grown Ups, perhaps the slackest, shabbiest comedy in the star's increasingly dreadful oeuvre. Putting Couples Retreat to shame in the film-as-studio-funded-vacation department, director-par-crapcellence Dennis Dugan's film teams Sandler with his old SNL mates Chris Rock, Rob Schneider, and David Spade-as well as Kevin James, here baldly subbing in for the late Chris Farley-in a tale about zero, zilch, and not a single freaking thing. The setup is that, 30 years after winning a youth basketball championship, the five friends and their families reunite at a lakeside cabin after the funeral of their beloved coach. And, um, that's it. There's no story to speak of, and certainly no conflict; the only drama concerns whether or not such a high-profile project will at some point muster the discipline and energy to concoct something faintly resembling a plot. It doesn't, instead opting to merely coast on the supposed hilarity of its leading man's banter, which is of a playfully nasty sort, usually taking place as the characters aimlessly stand around, and is always far more amusing to the on-screen participants than to any conscious viewer.  Sandler is Hollywood super-agent Lenny, whose main problem in life is that he's embarrassed about employing a nanny (upper-class guilt!) and horrified that his sons are spoiled brats who demand Voss bottled water at restaurants and wear clothes fit only for the Milan fashion shows run by wife Roxanne (Salma Hayek). Woe is the rich cinema mogul Ã  la Funny People, although at least in Judd Apatow's dramedy there was an internal struggle to pivot the jokiness around. Here, there's nothing to the slipshod proceedings but tossed-off wisecracks that seem to have been made up on the spot. In rough order, the film's jokes are: You're old! You're fat! You farted! You fell down! You're old! You're fat! You're drunk! You're womanly! You peed! That dog sounds funny! Crotch shot! Male ass shot! You're old! You're fat! We rule! And, mercifully, cue end credits. To discuss the film's humor is to denigrate the term, since without a guiding concept, any sort of nuance to the characters or their circumstances, and any rhythm from one incident to the next, the entire endeavor is reduced to merely A-list masturbation, a flimsy example of smug stars thinking that even their spontaneously improvised shit smells like roses.  So makeshift that the script, in desperate need of suspense, introduces and resolves Lenny and Roxanne's marital conflict in the same scene, Dugan's fiasco celebrates its males while predictably reducing their female counterparts to either pairs of drool-worthy boobs (Hayek, perpetually breast-feeding Maria Bello, pregnant Maya Rudolph, the two anonymous hotties playing Schneider's daughters) or objects of overweight-and-overage ridicule (Ebony Jo-Ann's grandma, Joyce Van Patten's elderly wife of Schneider's doofus). Rock is made fun of for being a feminine housedad and Schneider for loving older women, while James gets to chuckle along at gags about his heft, an aged-looking Spade suffers some slaps to the"
ACB_Doc9_Grown Ups,ACB,Comedy,Negative,Grown Ups,"Almost alone among my circle of moviegoing friends, I have held out hope for Adam Sandler's soul. I have insisted upon his potential, encouraged by his performances in Punch Drunk Love, Reign Over Me and even in last year's brave and baleful Funny People. His early comedies - Happy Gilmore especially - were dumb but possessed of anarchical energy, an animal will to chaos that almost trumped the predictability of their plots and their final-act capitulations to Hollywood convention. Though at this late date it is difficult to say precisely what it was I saw in Sandler, part of me always believed he would tire of faking it for money and establish himself as a great character actor, a film comedian of genuine depth or at least a welcome screen presence. In short, I thought that someday Adam Sandler would grow up. I see now that I was a fool for thinking that, for Adam Sandler has no incentive to mature into a fully formed adult. He makes oodles of money for doing the same stupid shtick over and over again, for audiences who have been trained to accept repetitive pratfalls and little spasms of micro-violence as entertainment. He's in one of those crazy but not unheard of situations where actually doing better work would have a negative effect on his bottom line.   I'm slow, but I eventually catch on. Adam Sandler is in his mid-40s now; he is all he will ever be - a lowbrow comic who doesn't want to work very hard at churning out (comedies) that would be harmless but for their admittedly minor contribution to the ongoing degradation and coarsening of American culture and the dumbing down of the American people. If Sandler gets bored, he might take on the odd dramatic role, he might briefly recommit himself to being genuinely funny for a one-off HBO special. He might flash his talent at us, but he's never going to work at actualizing that talent. Anyway, if you've seen the trailer for Grown Ups, you've pretty much seen the movie - at least the (funny) parts. It's (about) a group of childhood friends who reunite over a long July Fourth weekend after the death of the coach who led their Catholic Youth Organization basketball team to the championship when they were in junior high school. After the coach's funeral, they gather at a lake house they visited when they were children, now with their own quirky families in tow. It's not an unpromising premise actually, and the fact that Sandler enlists some of his real life pals - Chris Rock, Kevin James, David Spade, Rob Schneider - to play his on-screen friends at least sets up an interesting dynamic. It's more than a little reminiscent of Jason Miller's play That Championship Season, though stripped of its social critique and willingness to engage adult concerns. Miller directed the film version of his play in 1982; it would have been interesting to see the core cast of Grown Ups take on that material. But"
ACB_Doc10_Grown Ups,ACB,Comedy,Negative,Grown Ups,"The term ""boondoggle"" can mean many things. Generally, it's any kind of wasteful activity either intentionally or unintentionally masquerading as work. More commonly, it's used to refer to extravagant business trips that are thinly-veiled vacations. The word is typically bandied about by corporate execs who simply must examine the latest stock figures while sipping Mai Tais off a yacht in Cabo. But at least when the CEOs do it, the rest of us don't have to watch. When celebrities indulge in such activities, we get pricey duds like ""Couples Retreat"" and ""Ocean's 12"". The Adam Sandler comedy ""Grown Ups"" is basically a movie about a bunch of funny guys improving their way through the thinnest of plots. And it plays like watching someone else's vacation footage. Ostensibly written by Mr. Sandler and ""Joe Dirt"" scribe Fred Wolf, ""Grown Ups"" reunites five elementary school buddies for the funeral of their beloved basketball coach. The threadbare script quickly sets up its one-note characters with easily definable traits. Mr. Sandler plays ""the most high-powered agent in Hollywood"" (we know because that's literally his first line), but his kids have become entitled brats. Kevin James is a devoted family man with an overactive bladder (really). Chris Rock is a house-husband who gets no respect from his family. David Spade is the unmarried one who drinks. And Rob Schneider is the melodramatic one with a penchant for (much) older women. Listing the characters' names is unimportant - I defy anyone who sees the movie to name even two of the characters. Each actor is basically playing his typical well-worn persona. Only Mr. Rock plays a bit against type, and never quite finds his footing. On the other hand, Mr. James shows some real heart in a role that could've been nothing but pratfalls. And by then end, each character learns the type of minor life-lesson that occurs when a film is over-stuffed with actors and nothing is at stake (don't hide things from your wife, family is more important than work, eat a good breakfast, etc). There's even a ""group hug"" scene in which they all confess secrets. Well, that was easy. With not much to hold an audience's attention, Adam Sandler go-to director Dennis Dugan relies on non-stop, scattershot gags from the obvious (the kids are taught the word ""wasted"") to the more obvious (a flatulent grandma? Really?). A few hit (slapping Rob Schneider - always funny), most miss (poor Maria Bello and the constant lactation humor). The rest fall with a thud. Despite its best efforts, ""Grown Ups"" can't achieve that tightrope walk between crass humor and sappy heart that Judd Apatow has all but monopolized recently. I'm not saying stars don't deserve a vacation (it can't be easy to keep us schlubs entertained). But if you're going to go someplace warm and relax with your friends, then do that. Don't wrap it up and call it a movie. Either work or don't. In this case, ""Grown Ups"" might actually be more work for the audience than"
VCT_Doc1_DirtyGrandpa,VCT,Comedy,Negative,Dirty Grandpa,"I figure the new Robert De Niro comedy is called, simply and inelegantly, (Dirty Grandpa) because (Filthy-Foul-Mouthed-Misogynist-Sex-Crazed-Pervert-Filthy-Rotten-Old-Coot-Grandpa) was too ungainly for the marquee.  De Niro plays Dick Kelly, a recently widowed seventy-two year old. His grandson Jason (Zac Efron) is a twenty-something who gave up his dreams of being a photographer to study law and join his father (Dermot Mulroney) firm. Jason has his life figured out-he's about to marry the beautiful but controlling Meredith (Julianne Hough)-but is tragically unhip. According to grandpa he is like (Mitt Romney in Terminator.)  The grieving grandfather asks Jason to drive him to his summer home in Florida. (Your grandmother and I were there this time every year,) he explains. (It's what she would have wanted.) Instead of a melancholy pilgrimage the trip takes a sideways turn when Dick goes on the prowl for a woman. He gets the chance to hook up when Jason bumps into Shadia (Zoey Deutch), an old schoolmate of his, and her friends, including the oversexed Lenore (Aubrey Plaza).  (The greatest gift a grandson can give to his grandfather,) says Dick, (is a hot college girl who wants to have unprotected sex,) so they take a detour and follow the crowd to Daytona Beach. There they meet a male drug dealer named Pamela (Jason Mantzoukas) who introduces Jason to crack cocaine, get thrown in jail, compete in a bodybuilding contest and much more.  Of course Dick's unorthodox behaviour is ripe with life lessons... you just have to endure 60 minutes of pedophilia, masturbation and rape gags before those lessons become apparent.  (Dirty Grandpa) is credited to one writer but feels like it was penned by a group of drunken frat boys on the beer and bourbon binge. What, I guess, is supposed to be a funny look at aging and making the most of the time we all have, is reduced to a spectacle of a once revered thespian calling his lawyer grandson (Alan Douceowitz.) If this were a drinking game where you took a shot every time De Niro says (vagina) (and all of that word's derivations) or any number of other words I can't print here you'd have alcohol poisoning half an hour in. It mistakes politically incorrect (did he really just say that) jokes for actual humour.  Then there is the presence of the great man himself. I can forgive Zac Efron's participation in (Dirty Grandpa,) he's young and the idea of starring with De Niro (who he imitated rather perfectly in (Neighbors)) must have been irresistible but what is the star of (Taxi Driver) doing here? At one point Jason yells, (What the 'bleep' is wrong with you?) at him repeatedly. It's a legit question. Perhaps it's time for a career intervention. For the good of all of cinema let's get David O. Russell to talk to De Niro before he accepts (Dirty Grandpa Pt. 2.)  (Dirty Grandpa) is the kind of film that, one day, De Niro's great-grandchildren will watch and wonder what all the fuss about him was."
VCT_Doc2_DirtyGrandpa,VCT,Comedy,Positive,Dirty Grandpa,"Zac Efron has about twelve costume changes in Dirty Grandpa (Schwinging might have lost my count of a couple) and each one brings back the fun of playing with paper dolls. Best is his birthday suit which is memorably exhibited when Zac's character, Jason Kelly, escorts his horny, recently widowed grandfather (Robert DeNiro) to a spring break party in Daytona Beach. Delaying his upcoming wedding, Jason smokes some crack, gets lose and shows off his tanned, gym-sculpted frame. Zac does the Macarena and shows off that rump, cleaved like a smile.  Former Disney kid Zac is now a genuine sex godlet. His semi-annual strip act (The Paperboy, That Awkward Moment, Neighbors) has been one of the few reasons to keep one riveted to recent Hollywood movies. In the '60s women anticipated Paul Newman's requisite shirtless scenes, now moviegoers (women as well as liberated men) await Zac's posing. He's a clotheshorse in reverse. The reason for his tan is as obvious as his Pilates trunk and hairless, square pecs. Like Newman, he really is a cinematic paper doll and Dirty Grandpa is his runway show.  Item #1: Macarena  Like Donatello's David statue-but animated--Zac appears in the buff except for a stuffed animal toy covering his crotch. This fantasy image of Zac invades one's dreams-a variation on the toilet-planking in That Awkward Moment complete with erotic groin-grinding gestures. As any fashionista knows: Wearing less is more.  Item #2: Stop Staring At My Tits  After being arrested for beachfront indecency, Zac emerges from jail in a police-issue outfit: a cut-off tank-top exposing his abs with a printed motto:) Stop Staring At My Tits.) The amusing gender-twist points to hoped-for sluttiness. Zac's a straight-laced, nubile innocent who inspires lust, a Millennial version of Terry Southern's '60s female sex object Candy.  Item #3 Infinity Sex  After another arrest, Zac is outfitted in a black, fringed tank-top with a bedazzled Infinity sign. Future archeologists will laugh at the indication of obvious perpetual horniness while New York's Museum of Sex gets its next key exhibit.  Item #4 Imagine This  When Jason tucks his shirt in a pastel preppy ensemble, grandpa Dick Kelly (DeNiro) objects: (What are you H&R Cock Block?) Fact is, Zac's conservative country club attire is fetching. Every strip tease starts with formality and inhibitions that are fun to shed.  Item #4 (I'm Versatile)  Helping Grandpa (Robert DeNiro) enjoy a life of new sexual possibility, Zac competes in a spring break muscle show and, still, in those yellow, long-pants, flexes to indicate his sexual athleticism.  Item #5 Ready to Wear (out)  Even on the golf course where grandpa attempts to pick-up some ladies, Zac's wardrobe makes a gay point. Grandpa gripes, (You look like a keynote speaker at a butt-fucking convention.) It's the least of grandpa's worldly insults.  The fun of sex is the entire point of the raunchy, goofy Dirty Grandpa. You have to be humorless (and sex-averse) to be offended by its deliberate naughtiness as so many critics have demonstrated. Director Dan Mazer and screenwriter John Phillips are in the long, if disreputable, tradition of porn meisters"
VCT_Doc3_DirtyGrandpa,VCT,Comedy,Negative,Dirty Grandpa,"What makes a great comedy?  The obvious answer is that it has to makes you laugh!  But the best remembered comedies are the ones that allows you to connect with the characters.  You believe in their personality, often filled with their witty banter whilst exploring their complicated relationships. When those comedic moments happen, you laugh at their embarrassing plight.  All those elements I mentioned are absent in Dirty Grandpa...  One hour and forty-two minutes - time I would love to get back but sadly I don't own a time machine or a Men in Black memory erasing device.  Dirty Grandpa is not good and the only time you could envisage yourself watching this film is if you're with a group of friends and you couldn't care less at what you're watching.  But even under those circumstances, I still wouldn't put this on!  It's not to say that I'm a prude or easily offended.  I wasn't looking for a comedy film that was philosophical or contained some deeper meaning or perspective to life itself.  I knew what I was getting into therefore this was not a total surprise - the title of the film is a dead giveaway!  The simple fact is I wanted to be entertained.  When a joke is done right, you can't argue with it.   The point I'm trying to make is that those films I mentioned all have something memorable.  Whether it's a specific scene or a line of dialogue, once remembered it brings a smile to your face.  Dirty Grandpa doesn't have those standout moments.  Yes you will chuckle at some points but it's not (ha ha) funny.  You'll end up feeling like you're laughing at the film as a whole, questioning how it got made instead of laughing along with them and the moments that occur.  The film is filled with so much vulgarity and profanity that it overwhelms anything else this film had to offer.  The jokes are continuously forced as if it wasn't sure where to end it, filling in the gaps where the plot should be.  Trust me, there is a plot - it's hiding in plain sight.  In essence, Dirty Grandpa is about second chances, moving on and living life again.  Dick Kelly (Robert De Niro) loses his wife to cancer.  The last thing she said to him was to (get back out there again).  On that aspect alone, there is some sentiment especially with the older generation.  That being said, it doesn't take long before the dick jokes, the drug use, the sexual lust, the paedophilia, the gay and lesbian name calling, the N-word and a scene involving masturbation, for it to completely erase that sentiment.  It's like watching 2-3 films in one, as if you went shopping and got yourself an unexpected bargain.  But all it does is cover up how wafer thin the plot is.  On one hand you have a OAP coping with his wife's death. On the other you"
VCT_Doc4_DirtyGrandpa,VCT,Comedy,Positive,Dirty Grandpa,"When it works, it works - and, more often than not, Dirty Grandpa lands big, sometimes awkward laughs. While more Todd Phillips than Solondz, director Dan Mazer infuses the film with an uncomfortable sense of irony right up until its post-credit gag, which perhaps proves the shelf-life of a fetish might be longer than just a temporary phase. Those seeking the meaning of life ought to look elsewhere. The formula is familiar, while Zac Efron and Robert De Niro make an unexpectedly funny duo, with De Niro delivering zingers that would be inappropriate to mention on a site such as this.  Efron plays Jason, a recent law-school grad marrying the uptight Meredith (Julianne Hough) with the approval of his equally uptight father, David (Dermot Mulroney). After his grandmother passes, his grandfather, Dick (DeNiro), begs his grandson to take him across state-lines to his condo in Boca Raton. Against, of course, the wishes of Meredith, the kind of white bread politician's wife in the making, Jason agrees to go, but - one of many catches - he can't take the SUV. He has to take her pink convertible.  Dick transitions from the sweet, endearing old man into a horny man on a mission when he meets his match at random - Lenore, with Aubrey Plaza playing a parody of a sex-crazed college senior on the mission to complete a trifecta: student, alumni, professor - and she mistakenly thinks Dick is a professor. Lenore is a disturbed young women, and Plaza tests boundaries of decency as she confesses she lost her virginity at a Bingo hall and has a thing for older men. Cringe-inducing at times (Plaza's speciality), the film commits to the gag as Lenore and Dick commit to hook up.  Along the way, Jason has an epiphany (after trying crack for the first time), falling for a member of Lenore's posse, Shadia (Zoey Deutch), also his former lab partner in photography class. Even corporate lawyers once had dreams - so of course Jason's perfect life is about to be shattered. The film progresses through a series of spring-break rivalries, parties, arrests, and encounters with a friendly local drug dealer in Daytona who will accidentally feed you crack.  The thing about Dirty Grandpa is many of the laughs are just plain wrong, testing the boundaries of jokes about child molestation and Lenore's daddy complex, coupled with a genuine parody of whiteness on occasion. Mazer is fully in control of this opus of madness - perhaps it takes an outsider (in this case a Brit) to make fun of white representation in cinema. When Shadia tells Jason he looks like Mitt Romney, he commits the ultimate party fowl of asking (who let the dogs out) at a party - a nod to Romney's uncomfortable photo-op with a group of black youth. Yet the film really is, in the end, overwhelmingly about dick and drug jokes - several land and, against my better judgement, I confess I laughed, and hard.  Dirty Grandpa has a little more under the"
VCT_Doc5_DirtyGrandpa,VCT,Comedy,Negative,Dirty Grandpa,"It's one of those boilerplates about an uptight guy on the eve of marrying a harridan taking a road trip with a free spirit to discover that maybe he doesn't want to spend the rest of his life (or the few years until he secures a divorce--the subtext of these things is always curiously traditional) selling out to The Man. Jason (Zac Efron) is that potential sell-out. You can tell because he dresses like the villain from an Eighties college sex comedy, is a corporate lawyer, and is engaged to a materialistic bimbo (Julianne Hough) who will justify his unconscionable hedonism by being a secret slut herself in his absence. The best of these films is its prototype, obviously (Capra's It Happened One Night), but the one I return to most often is Bronwen Hughes's curiously sticky--if only to me--Forces of Nature. The high concept this time around is that De Niro is the free-spirit road-tripper in a role that asks him to, literally at one point, be rapping grandmother Ellen Dow from The Wedding Singer. The imposition of this masterplot is really the only thing separating the film from ""Jackass"" spin-off Bad Grandpa, just as one word is the only thing separating the two concepts. De Niro's Dick (and you do indeed get to see his dick--though admittedly, it's probably a stunt dick) is a former Green Beret, by the way, which explains/doesn't explain why he gets a Presidio fight sequence against a bunch of black hoods who've been taunting a gay black guy Dick has also recently been taunting.  There are many ways you could go in attacking something like Dirty Grandpa. The easiest is to lament the fall of arguably the greatest actor from the greatest period in the history of film, to rend clothing and ululate about how De Niro has begun cashing checks in his dotage. It's tempting to use clever turns of phrase like ""Aging Bull"" as shorthand to avoid engaging with it. The hard way to approach Dirty Grandpa is to try to draw it into the larger conversation of what's happened to the state of our state when stuff like this is right there on the verge of being accepted as the new social lingua franca. It's the movie version of Donald Trump and Sarah Palin. There's no thesis, just provocation upon non sequitur provocation. (Actually, the other thing separating Dirty Grandpa from Bad Grandpa is that the latter offers variations on a theme--societal prejudices towards the elderly--and so its own disjointedness feels more purposeful.) Many describe their style of politicking as ""impressionistic"" (nonsystemic/subjective) and it is assuredly at least that, and Dirty Grandpa falls under that umbra as well--but it's more than that, isn't it? The image I get in my head is of a probe that hits the spot for which it's probing. Explanation, if you're willing to stretch, for why De Niro's titular grandpa habitually greets his grandson Jason with a thumb jammed up his ass. The hardest way to"
VCT_Doc6_DirtyGrandpa,VCT,Comedy,Positive,Dirty Grandpa,"The film follows uptight and by-the-book, young lawyer Jason Kelly (Efron) who works at his stuffy father's film and is set to marry his over-bearing fiancÃ©e Meredith (Julianne Hough) in just over a week. Seeing that his grandson is soon to enter into a life of constant ""sleepwalking"" and being told what to do, Dick (De Niro) guilt-trips Jason into driving him to Florida for his annual holiday, in a last-ditch attempt to make Jason see sense and break free from his oppressed situation. His argument? That his late wife, and Jason's grandmother, would have wanted him to have kept up the tradition.However, Jason soon releases that his grandfather isn't the sweet, grieving man that he expected him to be, and is actually a foul-mouthed old guy who feels like he's missed out on the best years of his life and dreams of the day he can have some fun in the sack with well, anyone, to make up for lost time. Don't get it twisted though, Dick has some redeeming qualities. His sense of family is very much still intact and he remained completely faithful to his wife up until her final days. As if that's something we should praise him hero for, but heck, it kind of does make him a little endearing. During a pit stop on their travels, the pair run into Jason's old college friend Shadia (Zoey Deutch), who just so happened to be on his photography course - a subject he was very passionate about before he got unintentionally whisked away into the world of law. Shadia's accompanied by her friends: loose, sarcastic Lenore (Aubrey Plaza) who makes a sexual beeline for Dick, and their African-American gay friend Bradley, who swiftly becomes the butt of Dick's questionable teasing. The subjects of his barrage of mockery, we will let you assume.  Lenore invites them to Daytona Beach to party and again, Dick convinces Jason to go along, and that's when the film finally picks up momentum and as expected spewing at chugging contests, public Flex-Off's, accidental drug-taking and nights in jail ensue... as you do.   With Dirty Grandpa, absolutely anything goes when it comes to the opportunity of owning a gag, which is unsurprising given that it was directed by Borat writer Dan Mazer. A lot of the time, it's actually quite shocking how far both the script and the actors will take the joke, whether it be the up-close shot of a certain part of De Niro we can only hope is a prosthetic, a rapping Dick asking his new ""crew"" whether he can say the ""n-word"" or an awkwardly deadpan exchange between him and Lenore that depict in way too much explicit detail what they might do to each other if they ever go ""all the way"".  It's common knowledge that De Niro has made his Hollywood name by playing brilliantly intimidating, or sometimes downright terrifying, tough guys in films such as Cape Fear, The Untouchables and Taxi Driver.

VCT_Doc7_DirtyGrandpa,VCT,Comedy,Negative,Dirty Grandpa,"In 2016, there's very little point in trying to analyse Robert De Niro's career. He does what he feels like, and he sometimes swings himself Oscar nominations. Of far more concern is Zac Efron, who goes from a DJ movie with a character named Squirrel to... whatever this is.  Dirty Grandpa is an early contender for the most offensive film of 2016, and not in the (it's so funny, because you can't say that!) way, but in the (that's not funny, and you shouldn't have said it) sense.  The day after his grandmother's funeral, uptight lawyer Jason Kelly (Efron, We Are Your Friends) has to escort his Grandpa Dick (De Niro, Joy) to Florida to visit an old army buddy. Dick wants to show Jason some fun before his heavily choreographed wedding to Meredith (Julianne Hough, Safe Haven), so he tricks him into a trip to Daytona Beach.  No one in Dirty Grandpa is sympathetic, not the dream-crushed Jason, nor the horny Dick, and especially not Meredith, who has the lazy double-whammy of being shrewish and Jewish. Efron literally sleepwalks through the role, the type of part that he had explicitly taken time out to avoid. You can't have a scold if his foil is also a horrible person, and they only barely learn anything from one another. Efron remembers his hidden potential through the intervention of his old college buddy Shadia (Zoey Deutch, Vampire Academy), but forgets to have significant screen time with her.  The only person comfortable in the script is spring breaker Lenore, played by an Aubrey Plaza (TV's Parks and Recreation) all too game to throw herself across the screen. Plaza is the only person who knows exactly what movie she's in, and she attacks it with gusto. It helps that every line that she has is simply innuendo rather than charged with some sort of insult - it also gives De Niro a chance to rise above the rest of his material to have something approaching fun, and to make the man a legitimately (dirty) Grandpa instead of a racist misogynist homophobe.  It never quite gets there, but it does prove the potential value of a sex comedy starring De Niro and Plaza. Neither of them care about the finished product that is Dirty Grandpa, but they're coming at it from completely different directions.  What Dirty Grandpa really comes down to is not the cast, but the script. Poached from the increasingly meaningless Black List, John Phillips' screenwriting debut is carefully optimised so that each line has the maximum amount of crassness and meaninglessness. There are pop culture references that Phillips was unable to tie into the story, so they float freely, and two beyond awful characters just won't stop showing up. Adam Pally (Life After Beth) is bad enough as cousin Nick, but Jason Mantzoukas (The Night Before) has reached a career low as omnipresent drug dealer and entrepreneur Pam.  The heavy lifting is done offscreen; Dick charms people that he has previously made enemies of, but we never understand how"
VCT_Doc8_DirtyGrandpa,VCT,Comedy,Positive,Dirty Grandpa,"When January rolls around, the cinemas are filled with a weird of critically-acclaimed award films and low-brow genre films that don't have even the smallest chance of winning any award. By the time I'm seeing the movies in the mid-January slate, I'm done with award films, having been watching them for the past three months in order to vote in various groups.  So, when I start seeing the January movies (or at least the ones the studio has the stones to show us critics ahead of time), I actually am primed to enjoy them a little more. By this time of the year, I'm tired of significant movies showing people's impossible struggles over adversity. I'm ready for raunchy comedies and substandard horror flicks.  In this context, a movie like (Dirty Grandpa) appeals to me more than it would were it released in a later timeframe. I know that (Dirty Grandpa) has nothing in it that is redeeming, honorable or respectable. It's a low-brow comedy that is going for cheap laughs. And while cheap laughs are worth what you pay for them, I actually enjoy some of them quite a bit.  I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I'm a pig. It's okay to be a pig now and again.  More over, (Dirty Grandpa) has done nothing to hide its true nature. No one should be blindsided by this movie's premise or delivery. It's all out there in the trailers and the posters. You shouldn't be expecting a tender characters study between grandson and grandfather. Instead, you should be expecting a ribald comedy in which Robert De Niro sticks his junk against Zac Efron's face while they're sleeping.  About a month ago, (Sisters) opened as counter-programming against (Star Wars: The Force Awakens.) Though it was dwarfed by the latter in the box office, (Sisters) did well enough, and it went for similar low-brow laughs. At its heart, (Sisters) was an all-night house party movie with the twist of being about women in their 40s.  Similarly, (Dirty Grandpa) is a spring break road trip movie with a guy who cashes a social security check every month. The story follows Jason (Zac Efron), an uptight lawyer, whose recently-widowed grandfather Dick (Robert De Niro) convinces him to drive him to Florida on the eve of his weeding. Soon, we learn Dick's real plan is to show Jason a good time in order to stop him from marrying his stuck-up, snobby fiancÃ©e (Julianne Hough).  Not everything in this movie is funny, and the set-up takes a bit too long to play out. However, there are some moments that made me laugh, I'll admit. I enjoyed seeing De Niro play a different version of the foul-mouthed hothead (as opposed to the oodles of gangsters he's played over the years). I know there are plenty of people out there bemoaning De Niro's acting choices lately, but I have respect for the guy still having fun in front of the camera and taking some bolder choices. After all, last year he was quite"
VCT_Doc9_DirtyGrandpa,VCT,Comedy,Negative,Dirty Grandpa,"I am not going to mince words, dear readers. I've been getting paid to review films since 1997. In those 18-plus years, ""Dirty Grandpa"" is one of the worst, most disheartening times I have had in a movie theater. You see, to a certain group of cinema lovers, Robert De Niro is still a legend. He is still an artist who is held up as one of the gold standards of film acting. ""The Godfather, Part II,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" ""The Deer Hunter,"" ""Raging Bull,"" ""The Untouchables, ""Goodfellas,"" ""Heat."" These are landmarks of cinema, part of a certain age demographic's movie DNA. And they all feature landmark performances from Mr. De Niro. And that's not even mentioning his second tier of great films and great performances like ""Angel Heart,"" ""Awakenings,"" ""Cape Fear,"" ""Casino,"" ""Wag the Dog,"" and so forth. And most of his fans and admirers have never denied him those instances where he's had fun with his tough-guy, larger-than-life De Niro persona. A number of the lighter, more playful projects he has picked over the years have been quite delightful. And he's been delightful in them. Movies like ""Midnight Run,"" ""Meet the Parents,"" and ""Analyze This."" Sure, he's cashed in a few times with sequels like ""Little Fockers"" and ""Analyze That."" But he always came back with a ""Silver Linings Playbook"" or ""The Good Shepherd.""  What the %$&# was he thinking appearing in ""Dirty Grandpa?!"" It is a deeply crass, cringe-inducing, spectacularly unfunny movie that this great actor thoroughly embarrasses himself in. Here's just a few of things that I saw that I cannot un-see that I hope anyone reading this will never see. De Niro naked and masturbating hard to a porno film. De Niro putting the moves on a college girl at least 50 years his junior (to be fair, in real-life, actress Aubrey Plaza is ""only"" 41 years his junior). De Niro on stage rapping to Ice Cube's ""It Was a Good Day."" De Niro introducing his grandson as a ""retard"" who likes to rape. De Niro sleeping naked with his grandson, then waking him up by thrusting his penis in the young man's face. De Niro waxing nostalgic about the anal sex he and his wife would have every five years.  I'm not one of those film journalists who treats movie stars as royalty. They are not my role models. But I've always held De Niro in extremely high esteem. It's De Niro! I couldn't be more disappointed in the man. If he had sought out El Chapo for the sole purpose of giving him shoulder massages and hand-feeding him concord grapes, I couldn't be more disappointed in him. If he had used the press junket for ""Joy"" to spoil who dies at the end of ""The Force Awakens,"" I couldn't be more disappointed.  And then there are the indignities heaped on some of the other people in this cast. Dermot Mulroney, a fine actor, has two large penises drawn on his face with a magic marker while he's unconscious"
VCT_Doc10_DirtyGrandpa,VCT,Comedy,Positive,Dirty Grandpa,"There's nothing clever about this deliberately rude and vulgar comedy, but certain audiences will find it absolutely hilarious. Never afraid to head straight into the cheapest, nastiest gag, director Dan Mazar and writer John Phillips throw their odd-couple stars into a series of riotously awkward situations, usually involving nudity. And even if it's not as funny as it ought to be, at least there's some meaning to the chaos.  Zac Efron plays Jason, a bright young Atlanta lawyer who takes after his workaholic father (Dermot Mulroney). But Jason's grandfather Dick (Robert De Niro) remembers a more interesting Jason, before ruthless ambition took over his life. So after Grandma's funeral, Dick asks Jason to drive him down to Florida a week before Jason is due to marry the high-maintenance Meredith (Julianne Hough). Jason quickly discovers that Grandpa is intent on sowing some very wild oats, detouring their journey through Daytona at spring break, where they meet a couple of girls (Aubrey Plaza and Zoey Deutch) who are up for pretty much anything. What Jason doesn't know is that Grandpa is doing all of this to remind Jason who he really is, and to show him how to enjoy life instead of control it.  The script sometimes lays on this message rather thickly in between a series of deliberately jaw-dropping gross-out sequences. Predictably, drugs and sex abound, and most of the jokes are so corny and ludicrous that they're not remotely believable. Everything that happens strains to shock the audience, which means that nothing is actually very shocking. But while the story has no tension at all, it also manages to grab hold of the audience simply because the characters are so vividly played by the fearless Efron and De Niro. Neither role is much of a stretch, but they dive into even the yucky and/or naked moments with gusto, developing some chemistry in the process.  Annoyingly, Mazer misses the chance to inject even a hint of a blackly comical edge to the film, leaving everything feeling merely goofy. This gives the ace supporting cast little to do but try to steal their scenes (the hilarious Plaza walks off with the whole film). And it leaves even the genuinely funny scenes feeling rather pointless. Basically this is a movie for audiences who think that a penis is the most hilarious thing on earth. And they don't mind seeing a 72-year-old trying to take a 19-year-old to bed. This is certainly the kind of movie a serious film critic would never admit to laughing at. I couldn't possibly comment.  There's casual racism and homophobia played for laughs, but it's later rectified in a bizarre way, climaxing with De Niro saying the N-word(!). For all the time the film takes to smooth over that stuff, however, it is unapologetically sexist throughout. It's relentlessly low-brow, juvenile schoolboy humour and I feel somewhat guilty for enjoying it as much as I did. But it does what it does bloody well, De Niro and Aubrey Plaza in particular are great and"
HCC_DocW_LegallyBlonde1,HCC,Comedy,Positive,Legally Blonde,"If her dazzling turns in Election, Freeway, and The Man in the Moon weren't enough to convince you that Reese Witherspoon is one of her generation's greatest actresses, Legally Blonde will close the deal. A showcase for Witherspoon's dead-on comic timing, this new comedy is a slight and airy confection just perfect for the no-brainer summer months.  Witherspoon stars as Elle Woods, an L.A. college senior who's ostensibly a fashion merchandising major, but her real goal is to become the wife of Warner Huntington III (Tigerland's Matthew Davis). When Warner abruptly dumps her-telling Elle that as a future senator he needs to ""marry a Jackie, not a Marilyn""-Elle conspires to win him back by following him to Harvard Law School and impressing him with her smarts. And how can Harvard resist Elle's hilarious video essay, in which she wears a spangled bikini and explains her qualifications for being a lawyer?  Getting in to the school is one thing, but actually going to class and facing the professors (including a hilariously hard-ass Holland Taylor) is something else entirely. Spurred by rivalry with Warner's preppette fiancÃ©e Vivian (Selma Blair), Elle buckles down and starts making the grades, catching the eye of a professor (Victor Garber) who assigns her to help out with a murder case involving an exercise guru (Ali Larter) who, as luck would have it, is a sorority sister of Elle's.  Legally Blonde has been getting lots of comparisons to Clueless because of its bimbo-with-a-brain heroine, but the film plays more like Private Benjamin-spoiled girl enters august institution for the wrong reasons, then rises to the occasion and develops character in adversity-with a dash of The Paper Chase thrown in for good measure. Writers Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith (10 Things I Hate About You) keep things zippy with one-liners like ""Last week I saw Cameron Diaz at Fred Segal, and I talked her out of buying a truly heinous angora sweater. Whoever said orange was the new pink was seriously disturbed."" There's plenty here for gay audiences to chew on as well, from Meredith Scott Lynn's amusingly earnest dyke Enid (who recalls her undergrad organizing of the Lesbians Against Drunk Driving march as ""good times"") to the queer twists of the murder trial (involving designer shoes and a Cher tape).  Alas, first-time director Robert Luketic (director of the award-winning short Titsiana Booberini) isn't always up to the task here: Once you get past Elle's dazzlingly dippy wardrobe (and her pink, faux-fur-covered phone), the movie doesn't have the visual oomph that this sort of comedy demands. There's also a big sequence involving Elle teaching her manicurist pal (Best in Show's Jennifer Coolidge) and a salon full of ladies (and male hairdressers) how to do the flirty ""bend and snap"" move, but the camera's never exactly where it ought to be to make this scene zing the way it should.

The movie is a lot like 1995's ""Clueless,"" which was also totally cute, in that it has a brain and a heart. And like its heroine, it's a lot smarter than it looks. Hopefully, it'll do more for Reese Witherspoon's career than ""Clueless"" did for Alicia Silverstone's. (Hull-o? Anyone remember ""Excess Baggage""?) Witherspoon plays the fabulously dressed and perfectly coifed Elle Woods: president of the Delta Nu sorority, Miss June in the campus calendar, AND she has a 4.0 grade point average. OK, so her major is, like, fashion merchandising. The girl is an expert on varying shades of pink. Elle thinks her gorgeous boyfriend, Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis), is going to pop the question over a special dinner, but he dumps her instead, telling her that his dreams of being a politician demand that he have a more substantial mate - whatever THAT means. ""If I'm going to be a senator by the time I'm 30, I need to stop (messing) around,"" Warner tells Elle as she cries in her champagne. One day at the salon, she gets the BEST idea - she'll show Warner she can be all serious and stuff by following him to Harvard Law School! She studies super hard for the law school entrance exam, which her best friends (Jessica Cauffiel and Alanna Ubach) TOTALLY don't understand. And the video she makes to go with her application is hys-TER-ical. She had a Coppola direct it, and she appears dressed in an array of sequined bikinis, spouting legal terms as well as the latest ""Days of Our Lives"" developments. Her dad doesn't see the point. ""Law school is for people who are boring and ugly and serious, and you, button, are none of those things,"" he tells her, an ever-present martini in hand. But she gets in! She totally doesn't fit in at first, especially toting her a-DOR-able Chihuahua everywhere she goes, dressed in a matching outfit. And she's nothing like those uptight East Coast students - especially Vivian Kensington (Selma Blair, who co-starred with Witherspoon in the 1999 guilty pleasure ""Cruel Intentions"") that horrible blue-blooded snob Warner is dating. But her keen intuition, unbeatable enthusiasm and impeccable sense of style see her through. She even helps out on a murder trial. How cool is THAT? (OK, so the movie does drag a bit here, but you can't have everything, you know?) Witherspoon showed in 1999's ""Election"" how complete she can make a character, how she can turn somebody annoying into a sympathetic figure you want to cheer for. Elle isn't nearly as obnoxious as overachieving Tracy Flick in ""Election,"" but she is interminably perky, which would be hard to tolerate on anyone else. Witherspoon appears in nearly every frame of the movie, and she positively sparkles. ""Legally"

When she's dumped by her Harvard Law School-bound boyfriend Warner (Matthew Davis) -- because she's too blonde to be considered seriously as wife material -- she fights back, nail by manicured nail, first by following Warner to Harvard Law School, then by proving that just because you're blonde doesn't mean you're a joke. The movie, however, is full of good humor. Based on the novel of the same name by Amanda Brown, and adapted for the screen by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith (""10 Things I Hate About You,"" 1999), ""Legally Blonde"" is a sassy satire that retains a message: believe in yourself and follow your dreams. Besides being funny, it's an ode to self-empowerment -- especially girl power -- and its target audience of young women everywhere will gobble it up like the latest glossy edition of Cosmopolitan magazine.  Blonde-out-of-water story  Elle isn't such an unlikely candidate for Harvard Law; she did have a 4.0 average as an undergraduate at the fictional CULA. (Of course, her major was fashion merchandising.) Moreover, she also has a very impressive background as homecoming queen and sorority president, her signature color is pink, and she's appeared in a Ricky Martin music video. Who could ask for anything more? She's an emblem of diversity! Naturally, she's accepted. Nothing will stop her now as she campaigns all over Harvard to win back her man. Call it blonde ambition. ""Legally Blonde"" becomes a ""blonde-out-of-water"" story as her snobby fellow law students begin taking bets on how long she'll last. Meanwhile, she discovers that Warner isn't worth all the effort. Succeeding in law school becomes a personal goal, and not merely a means to win back her shallow boy toy. She's a bubbly blonde with brains. Her points of reference may not be Plato and Socrates, but she proves that knowledge about Clinique, Porsches and lip gloss also can come in handy in a classroom or a courtroom.  Fine support The supporting cast is a winning bunch. Selma Blair (a former Witherspoon costar in ""Cruel Intentions,"" 1999) is excellent as Vivian Kensington, a perfect bitch -- complete with pearls -- who has snagged Warner and is wearing his grandmother's six-carat Harry Winston diamond engagement ring on her ""bony"" finger.

And Jennifer Coolidge, most recently seen in 2000's ""Best of Show,"" turns in a touching performance as a middle-aged high school dropout manicurist befriended by Elle at a local beauty shop -- the only place where Elle feels at home when she first arrives in the Ivy League.

HCC_DocW_LegallyBlonde4,HCC,Comedy,Positive,Legally Blonde,"She may be follically blond, but as an actor of distinction who's all of 25, Reese Witherspoon reveals interesting dark roots even as she plays golden girls. And while I'm not saying physiognomy is destiny, I do think that sharp, stubborn little Witherspoon chin has something to do with it: No matter how virginal or blithe she's supposed to be (in movies like ""Fear"" or ""Cruel Intentions""), her structural pointiness belies easy sweetness, suggesting the iron girder determination that supports her best performances, in movies like ""Pleasantville"" or, especially, ""Election."" To see Witherspoon daintily claw her way to success as the infernally perky Tracy Flick, candidate for student council president, in that triumphant antiblond manifesto, is to see a young actress in exciting control of her Clairol powers.  In the likable lollipop comedy Legally Blonde, Witherspoon is flaxen to classic California girl specifications as Elle Woods, a West Coast campus princess who wafts through life on a cloud of privilege. Elle is rich, popular, and outfitted in the kind of predominantly pink clothes only the very fashion victimized or self confident would dare wear. But just when she expects to grab her big prize - a marriage proposal from her cute boyfriend, Warner (""Tigerland""'s Matthew Davis) - she's devastated to learn that her mealy beau, who has political ambitions and a place waiting for him at Harvard Law School, has no plans for a ""dumb"" blondie in his future. (His chosen fiancÃ©e, Elle soon discovers, is a pedigreed prune with a dank, brunet worldview, and she's wonderfully played by Witherspoon's ""Cruel Intentions"" costar Selma Blair.)  The cheery, simple punchline of ""Legally Blonde"" is that dumbness has nothing to do with it: Don't hate Elle because she's beautiful, and don't dismiss this summer flick because it's not as hip to itself as ""Clueless"" or as well made as ""Election."" Sweetly intent on proving she's worthy of the lummox, Elle gets herself into Harvard Law School too, bowling the admissions committee over not so much with her transcript (although she does have good test scores) as with her admissions video (directed by ""a Coppola"").  Elle not only makes it through law school, of course. She triumphs, winning friends and influencing people through a combination of glinting highlights, sturdy self confidence, and, it turns out, real brains packaged in silly clothes. I'd be happier for future scholars of hair color everywhere if screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith (""10 Things I Hate About You"") took more risks and gave Elle more of a contour, making her either sharper or more rounded, or if first time feature director Robert Luketic messed with the unflaggingly light tone some more.  Actually, I'd be happier if I had a little better idea of what really matters to Elle (besides turning lemons into lemonade). And I desperately want to know, even as I laugh and admire her enchanted existence, whether this blond operates from a plan or in a burst proof bubble. But maybe that's something only her hairdresser knows for"
HCC_DocW_LegallyBlonde5,HCC,Comedy,Positive,Legally Blonde,"You have to appreciate a movie whose title essentially sums up the whole thing. In Legally Blonde, Reese Witherspoon plays a blonde who ends up at Harvard law school. If you think you've got the whole movie figured out from this scenario, you may be surprised to find out your preconceptions are only half-right. This isn't a dumb comedy; it has a certain amount of intelligence to it. It's at least smart enough not to make Elle Woods, the Witherspoon character, stupid-just ditzy. It also has the advantage of having Witherspoon in the lead role. No matter what her character says or does, she is always charming. Elle is a student and sorority sister at CULA. She has been dating Warren Huntignton III (Matthew Davis), and the beginning of the movie has her preparing for a big night. She's sure Warren will propose to her tonight. However, at dinner, Warren states his desire to become a Senator and dumps Elle (""I need a Jackie, not a Marilyn.""). Witherspoon's reaction is great. She tries to hide her emotions in fear of embarrassing them, but she'll occasionally let out a loud sob that gains everyone's attention. Warren is on his way to Harvard for law school, and during their split, Elle realizes what she needs to do to get him back. She also needs to go to Harvard. After some major studying and preparation, she actually gets accepted. Warren is, of course, shocked to discover her appearance, and after a bad first class, Elle is even more shocked to discover that Warren is engaged to an old girlfriend, Vivian Kensington (Selma Blair). Will Elle start to take law school seriously? Will she try to get Warren back? Will the opportunity for her to shine arise? Of course these things will happen, but there are actually a few surprises along the way. Elle and Vivian's relationship takes an unexpected turn. The girls from home don't arrive to shake things up (at least for a while). And most importantly, Elle is actually smart. Well, at least when it comes to hair treatment and fashion. But still, Elle is never dumbed down, and she never once comes across as fake or annoying. Some of the material here is throw-away. There's an entire subplot involving a manicurist and a delivery man that seems thrown in to extend the running time. The scenes involving the subplot range from generic and predictable (a custody battle over a dog and a nose injury from flirting) to confusing and unnecessary (particularly the ""bend and snap"" dance sequence). The courtroom scenes are funny, and they stay true to Elle's character. I liked how she outs a witness from his observation about designer shoes (prompting the biggest laugh in the movie). Essentially, this is Witherspoon's movie. She's charming and funny and stays consistent with her character while never going over the top with her shortcomings. They could have been played for easy laughs, and I appreciate the movie's restraint. I'm surprised how much the movie grew"
HCC_DocW_LegallyBlonde6,HCC,Comedy,Negative,Legally Blonde,"The good news is that there aren't nearly as many dumb-blonde jokes in Legally Blonde as one might expect. The bad news is there aren't too many jokes period.  In another era, this film would have been called ""Tammy Goes to Law School,"" and the role of Elle Woods, well-played here by Reese Witherspoon, would certainly have gone to Debbie Reynolds or Sandra Dee. For this is a mild, somewhat sugary romantic comedy about a young woman with a perky personality who chases the man of her dreams to Harvard Law School only to discover she prefers the law to her knucklehead ex-boyfriend.  Predictable, cutesy and surprisingly short on genuine humor, Legally Blonde gets by thanks to the magnetic presence of Witherspoon. The MGM pic should open well, but whether this Blonde has the shapely legs to sustain a long theatrical run in the heat of summer is doubtful. The film could have a modest success in video and cable markets.  The perfunctory, implausible setup has Elle, a postfeminist girl with only marriage on her mind after graduation from a Los Angeles university, jilted by longtime beau Warner Harrington III (Matthew Davis). Determined to get elected to the U.S. Senate by age 30, this rich kid on his way to Harvard Law School can't afford the burden of a blond airhead for a wife.  Only Elle, while blond, is no airhead. The movie swiftly establishes her as a smart woman but one whose priorities place clothing and nail and hair design far above, say, education or world events. (When a classmate claims to have spent the last two years in Bosnia, Elle remarks that that would explain her hairdo.)  Against all logic, Elle immediately gets accepted into Harvard Law School, too - boy, that was easy. This sets up a cultural clash as Elle's signature pink - worn by her and her Chihuahua, Moonie - fails to jibe with the navy-blue blazer world of law school. Clothing certainly means everything in this movie as the filmmakers display a strong bias for blue-collar duds and exuberant flash over upper-class sartorial conservatism.  Eager to get the movie out of classrooms and libraries, the second half plunges into an absurd storyline that has these first-year law students ditch their books to help a professor defend a woman charged with murder.  Young Australian filmmaker Robert Luketic, directing his first feature and perhaps a little out of his depth, plays much of the comedy too broadly. But this undoubtedly springs from desperation as Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith's screenplay lacks any real humor.  In Sandra Dee's time, Hollywood could portray innocence with a charming straightforwardness. Nowadays, the strain shows. Unwilling to give their heroine the bad habits and social faux pas of the titular character in Bridget Jones's Diary - to which this movie bears a passing resemblance - the filmmakers are baffled how to wring humor out of Elle's milk-and-cookies personality. Instead they take tepid potshots at characters' social attitudes, preppy snobbery, spineless behavior and male chauvinism.  Several actors do register despite"
HCC_DocW_LegallyBlonde7,HCC,Comedy,Negative,Legally Blonde,"""Legally Blonde,"" a hefty handful of funny jokes notwithstanding, lacks a pleasing shapeliness. But you can't say the same thing about its star, Reese Witherspoon: Her sophisticated-pixie brilliance practically makes the movie, and her easy, confident, curvaceous carriage doesn't hurt, either -- she's the thinking guy's cupcake, maybe because her mind is just as supple as her curves. When, as Beverly Hills-bred sorority girl Elle Woods, she shows up for her first day at Harvard Law School in a trim-fitting ensemble of pink pearlized leather, the only appropriate response is a heart-shaped sigh. If it's possible to play the essence of a perfume cloud -- an '80s classic like Yves St. Laurent's ""Opium,"" let's say -- Witherspoon does it in ""Legally Blonde.""  When we first meet Reese's blond glamour-cutie Elle Woods it's the end of her senior year in college, and she's eagerly awaiting the ring and marriage proposal that she's sure her handsome, dull boyfriend Warner (Matthew Davis) is about to deliver. He doesn't come through: He's on his way to law school, and he's hoping for a career in politics. ""If I'm going to be a senator, I need to marry a Jackie, not a Marilyn,"" he explains matter-of-factly, delivering the line more to Elle's plunging neckline than to her face.  First heartbroken, then determined, Elle decides that the best way to get Warner back is to get into law school herself. She has a 4.0 grade point average -- so what if it's in fashion merchandising? She puts on a sequined bikini for her admissions video, and somehow the old codgers at Harvard decide she might just be a complementary addition to their hallowed halls. When she arrives on campus, though, she realizes that no one takes her seriously because of the way she looks, least of all the haughty brunet prep Vivian Kensington (played by the marvelous Selma Blair), who, much to Elle's horror, has stolen Warner away over the summer. That means war: Elle sets out to prove her snooty classmates wrong and get her boyfriend back.  The opening scenes of ""Legally Blonde"" (directed by Robert Luketic, making his feature debut) vibrate with a bubble-gum pink glow, and their cartoonishness is exhilarating. We see Elle in her sorority house, surrounded by a gaggle of giggling sisters, getting ready for her big date with Warner: None of these women are exactly rocket scientists, but Luketic doesn't hurl cheap jokes at them so much as bounce gags off them with a gentle ping. When it comes to humor, Luketic has a nice touch. He knows how to frame individual jokes so they're like little jewels. There's one particularly brilliant one-liner delivered by the always-funny Jennifer Coolidge (perhaps best remembered as Stiffler's mom in ""American Pie"") as Paulette, a friend the depressed Elle makes at a beauty parlor far outside the tweedy, upper-crusty confines of Harvard Square. I won't give it away here, but Coolidge delivers the joke with such offhanded insouciance that it seems to take a quick whirl around"

But while Elle is played with irresistibly bouncy ebullience by the wonderfully daft Reese Witherspoon (""Election,"" ""Freeway""), the movie never provides any evidence of her supposed smarts. She just gets lucky a lot, like when her knowledge of hair care helps save an innocent murder defendant in a big case she has no business handling as an intern at a big law firm.  Such simplistic, ain't-it-wacky solutions to life's dilemmas are the driving force of this pastel colored picture that is funny from time to time, but is also weighed down with trite ""have faith in yourself"" messages, as if it's some kind of after school special.  Screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith (""10 Things I Hate About You"") ply ""Blonde"" with such transparent plot devices that five minutes after the opening credits the entire story arc is laid out before you like a road map drawn in crayon.  Petty hunk and aspiring politician Warner (Matthew Davis) dumps Elle in the first reel, just before departing for Harvard, declaring ""If I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm 30...I need to marry a Jackie, not a Marilyn.""  Too vapid to see him for the loser he is, fashion merchandising major Elle applies to Harvard Law School herself, making an impression on the old boy network admissions board with her 4.0 GPA and a video essay that makes them drool -- Elle argues her qualifications from a hot tub wearing a sequined bikini.  Next thing you know, she's standing out on the buttoned-down campus in her inexplicably retro, ""Dynasty"" cast-offs wardrobe. She's also in over her head taking heavy-duty year-one classes while competing for Warner's affections with a condescending blue-blooded preppie brunette (histrionically pouty Selma Blair).  Can the plain but sweetly genuine guy that will make her forget Warner be far behind? Of course not. He's played by the charmingly awkward and always understated Luke Wilson (the bartender in ""Charlie's Angels"").  ""Legally Blonde"" fancies itself something of a collegiate ""Clueless,"" but it hasn't the wit and creativity of that hilarious and spot-on caricature of '90s teen culture. That's not to say it doesn't have its moments. Liberally scattered among the movies steady supply of hackneyed conventions are genuinely funny japes and site gags, like when on the first day of school all her classmates open up their laptops to take notes on a lecture, Elle pulls out a pencil and a heart-shaped pad of paper. (Later she buys -- what else? -- an orange iBook.)  First time director-for-hire Robert Luketic does what he can to free the joviality of the story from the sloppy, predictable, pedestrian script (although it's all too obvious he hurried up the plot in editing). Witherspoon is such a gifted comedienne she can milk even the most superficial moments"
HCC_DocW_LegallyBlonde9,HCC,Comedy,Negative,Legally Blonde,"Newcomer Robert Luketic makes his feature film debut and has the good fortune to hook up with the talented Reese Witherspoon. Overall, ""Legally Blonde"" is a lost opportunity that uses cliche instead of originality to make its point that just because someone is a blonde, it doesn't necessarily mean they are dumb. Fortunately, Witherspoon is a talented young actress who has strong comedic ability and is able to carry the film herself. This is a good thing as the script by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith doesn't get beyond the two-dimensional. From the very start of the flick, we are presented with a character, Elle, who is by no means a dumb bunny. When Warner dumps her because she's not smart enough, I began to have a problem with the story. How could this guy spend so much time with Elle and not see that she is not just a pretty face? When she gains admission, at the last minute, to Harvard Law School, it should be apparent, to all, that Elle is not just smart, she is very smart. But, if the characters in the film were as observant as we are, they would realize that Elle is special and there wouldn't be a movie here. So, we have to wait until they all come to their senses and see Elle for what she really is. The burden of carrying ""Legally Blonde"" falls upon the shoulders of Reese Witherspoon and, with confidence and capability, she pulls it off. There is little beneath the surface of the story as we watch Elle prove herself smart time and time again. She is not just pretty and soon proves herself equal to any intellectual task presented her.. She is, of course, selected by one of her professors (Victor Garber) to be a law clerk on a high profile murder case. Her ex-boyfriend, Warner, and his new, serious (i.e. not blonde) girlfriend Vivian (Selma Blair) are also part of the team and Elle has to prove, repeatedly, that her blonde roots have not dumbed her down. Eventually, everyone gets the point. There is little going on with the supporting cast, mainly due to the shallow script that develops no one besides Elle. Luke Wilson is an obvious romantic interest, but that whole development is left as a footnote at the end of the film. Selma Blair, who made such a funny, charming splash in ""Cruel Intentions,"" is left out in the cold as non-blonde Vivian. Matthew Davis is clueless as Warner and it makes one wonder just what Elle would see in such a narrow-minded and not that bright a guy. The rest of the cast members are more symbolic than real. Overall, production values are on the cheap side and, like the screenplay, shallow. Photography, by Anthony B. Richmond, looks murky and, except for some nice shots of Boston and Cambridge, is not notable. Kudos to Sophie de Rakoff Carbonell for her costuming of Witherspoon and her pet Chihuahua, Bruiser.

HCC_DocW_LegallyBlonde10,HCC,Comedy,Negative,Legally Blonde,"Legally Blonde fits into the niche occupied by motion pictures like Clueless, Dick, and Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion - that is to say, films in which an airhead heroine captures our affection and overcomes her vacuous disability to triumph. However, while Legally Blonde boasts its share of cute moments, the production has at least one significant problem - the plot. Director Robert Luketic's feature debut is handicapped by a lame, predictable storyline that calls attention to itself too often. Admittedly, in all but the best comedies, plot is usually not a strong suit, but the filmmakers of Legally Blonde make the mistake of believing the audience will care about the way things progress, which is not likely to happen.  Without question, Reese Witherspoon carries the film. The actress, who has basically grown up in front of the camera, has previously shown a strong grasp of both comedy and drama, and this is the most effective satirical performance she has given since Election. Witherspoon's character, Elle Woods, is on screen for a majority of the running time, and it's worth noting that the movie wouldn't have been as watchable with a less capable actress in the lead role. It takes a talented performer to make a dumb character likeable (as opposed to irritating).  When Legally Blonde opens, Elle has just finished a highly successful four years at college, where she majored in fashion, was president of the Delta Nu sorority, and appeared in a Ricky Martin music video. Now, as she prepares to enter real life, she is expecting a proposal from her boyfriend, Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis). What she gets, instead, is the kiss-off. Warner is headed for Harvard Law School, and doesn't want to be encumbered by a California girl. He intends to be a U.S. Senator by the age of 30, and, for that to happen, he needs the ""right kind"" of wife, and she's not Elle. Undeterred, our heroine decides to follow Warner to law school, and, after preparing an unorthodox admission essay and doing surprisingly well on the LSATs, she is accepted. Once at Harvard, she sets out not only to win Warner back from his new, snooty girlfriend, Vivian (Selma Blair), but to prove that she can become a lawyer.  Legally Blonde combines three plot staples: the triumph over adversity, the romantic comedy, and the courtroom comedy. The resulting uneven confection is sporadically affable, but the movie suffers because it never attempts to push the envelope or challenge its boundaries. The production targets teenagers (girls more than boys) who are content to watch a motion picture with a few laughs and a happy ending. For every sly or barbed comment, there are a dozen missed opportunities. Legally Blonde wants so desperately to be liked by everyone (even lawyers, whom it jokingly calls ""people who are boring, ugly, and serious"") that it takes pains to neuter its insults.  For much of the first two-thirds, Legally Blonde remains within the realm of mild satire and lighthearted comedy; however,"
GCS_Doc1_LostCity,GCS,Comedy,Positive,Lost City,"The Lost City is a Paramount Pictures production directed and co-written by Adam and Aaron Nee. Novelist Lorretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) feels stuck in a rut; she's grown increasingly sick of her highly successful line of romance novels and the grief of her husband's death threatens to swallow her whole. While on a press tour for her latest book, (The Lost City of D) (which also happens to be the film's original title) Lorretta is kidnapped by the wealthy Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). Fairfax believes that the key to a lost treasure lies within Loretta's books and wants her help finding it. It falls to Alan (Channing Tatum), the cover model for Loretta's books, to stage a rescue - trouble is, he's not equipped to protect her and she views him as a symbol of everything wrong with her life. The adventure film's slowly been making a comeback, with films like Jungle Cruise and Uncharted providing plenty of thrills and chemistry between its leads - well, at least Jungle Cruise does. The Nees, along with co-writers Orien Uziel, Dana Fox, and Seth Gordon (who conceived the story), fully understand the tropes of the genre and how to subvert them. The male lead, who usually takes charge and has a wealth of skills, is in way over his head. The female lead, usually placed in distress, turns out to be extremely resourceful and clever. There's even a twist surrounding the artifact that all parties are seeking that I won't spoil, but it's a perfect fit for the underlying themes of love that run through the film. Speaking of love, the major draw of the film - and the main thing that keeps it running - is the chemistry between Bullock and Tatum. Bullock's no stranger to wild twists on genre or working as part of an odd couple, as fans of The Proposal and The Heat can attest. But in The Lost City, she plays Loretta as more emotionally bruised than her previous characters. This is a woman who prefers to spend her nights in the bathtub with a glass of chardonnay and is ready to close the book on a successful series despite the advice of her publicist Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph). Tatum has the chance to enter full himbo mode here and he goes for it with gusto; even though he can't match opponents in hand-to-hand combat, he makes sure to bring Loretta her favorite snacks and some more sensible footwear for the jungle. The duo also takes part in some hilarious moments, including Tatum freaking out when leeches attach themselves to his rear end and Bullock rocking a sparkling purple sequined jumpsuit for half the movie. Make no mistake, The Lost City is an action-comedy and it embraces both halves of that equation. An attempt by Alan to infiltrate Fairfax's camp and rescue Loretta doesn't go so hot, as he's no match for the trained mercenaries patrolling the boundaries. A chase scene has Alan using a motorcycle that's"

It was a decade known for comedic hijinks, daring adventure, and movies that offered that most cliched of descriptions: fun. We have been inundated of late with heavily dramatic fare focused on flawed characters with dire arcs, but what about moviegoers who just want to put the last two years behind them and escape for a while? Well you can relax, The Lost City was made for you. Sandra Bullock stars as Loretta Sage, a winsome yet disillusioned widow and romance novelist whose greatest success is a heroic adventurer named Dash. As every romance novel needs a sexed-up jacket, Channing Tatum stars as Alan, the handsome cover model who has embodied Dash for years despite lacking the actual skills the character possesses. After yet another media event devolves into horny readers screaming for Dash to drop his shirt, Loretta proclaims it's time to kill Dash off...much to Alan's dismay. Just as Loretta and Alan spare words over the decision, Loretta is politely kidnapped by Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe), a rich megalomaniac - as if there's any other kind - determined to find the hidden treasure rumored to be located in the Lost City of D. Loretta and her husband were seekers of the city, and her writings on the topic have convinced Fairfax that she can ultimately help him locate the treasure. With the help of Loretta's fierce publisher, Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), and an enigmatic rescue specialist (Brad Pitt, clearly relishing the opportunity to charismatically kick ass while glistening in the sunlight), Alan mounts a rescue attempt. Taken to a remote island surrounding a simmering volcano, the rescue attempt goes sideways and Alan and Loretta are on their own fighting against mercenaries and their own desire to find the treasure before Fairfax.Paying its respects to Romancing the Stone as it unspools, The Lost City is a zippy romantic comedy with shades of action to keep the demographics happy. Directors Aaron and Adam Nee have no aspirations of anything but a good time at the theater. The filmmakers have a firm grasp on this template, and mostly pull it off with aplomb. The only real critique I have is that the third act lacks a tinge of the punch of the first two-thirds, though it's a minor issue. The pacing is crisp, the actors are clearly having a wonderful time, laughs are plentiful, and there's even a set piece here and there to keep the adrenaline up.The real sales pitch is the cast. Sandra Bullock returns to the type of role that made her a star with Loretta Sage. Loretta is a strong, independent woman who has forgotten why her success even matters anymore. Still coping with the loss of her husband, her spirit simply isn't in the character of Dash. She craves more in her art, rather than be used as a show pony in a sequined purple jumpsuit for"

No, it's The Lost City, a spiritual successor that's comes close to being just as fun and thrilling. Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) has just released The Lost City of D, the latest in a series of romantic adventure books that she herself long ago lost interest in. On her book tour, she gets kidnapped by Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe), a billionaire who's convinced the lost city and accompanying treasure described in her book is real. To the rescue is Alan (Channing Tatum), the cover model for Loretta's books who's desperate to prove he's more than just a pretty face and a killer set of pecs. It probably goes without saying that he and Loretta are way, way out of their comfort zones here. Just a little bit of personal stuff to start off with. As a child of the 80s, I did end up watching Romancing the Stone multiple times. It was a favorite of my mother's, and as a young gay boy, I found myself instinctively drawn to Kathleen Turner. So when I saw the trailers for The Lost City, it seemed like a modern attempt to replicate that film's seemingly effortless genre balancing act and perfect cast chemistry. It even opens with a fake-out scene that turns out to be a passage from the author protagonist's current work-in-progress. However, what I was not expecting was how fun, funny, exciting, and enjoyable The Lost City would end up being. Directors Aaron and Adam Nee - who also wrote the film with Mortal Kombat's Oren Uziel and Cruella's Dana Fox - have created a fabulous matinee genre film. Imperfect perhaps, but one that flows so effortlessly and quickly that any of its flaws are quickly forgotten as we race from scene to scene. This is a film that lives, breathes, jumps, and runs completely on the strength of the chemistry between the leads. Thankfully, this is not a problem. Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum are simply fantastic together. Even if you aren't huge fans of either, seeing them as a duo is nothing short of entertaining. They banter, they bicker, and they learn to trust each other with a rapport that feels entirely organic and natural. Which is quite a feat given how tangled and complicated a place their characters' relationship starts in. When the film opens, Alan has been the model for 20 of Loretta's books and has come to fully associate himself with her heroic, Fabio-esque lead, Dash McMahon. The two do press events where the intellectual and socially awkward Loretta is constantly upstaged by Alan's Chippendale showboating.

The film doesn't set out to do anything different, settling into the comforts certain tropes and story beats provide. However, that doesn't make The Lost City any less fun than it aims to be. With the effortlessly charming and talented cast doing most of the heavy lifting, The Lost City makes for a highly entertaining, joyful adventure. The Lost City follows best-selling romance author Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock), a widow who is trying her best to finish her latest book in time for a book tour her manager, Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), put together. Loretta isn't feeling it, though, especially when she realizes Alan (Channing Tatum), a model who portrays Dash, Loretta's character, on the cover of all of her books, will be at the events. All Alan wants to do is please Loretta, but all the recluse wants to do is to go back home. However, her life takes an adventurous turn when she's kidnapped by billionaire Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe), who believes the Lost City of D the author wrote about - as well as the tomb containing a treasure he's seeking - is real. Enter Alan who, despite not knowing at all what he's doing, endeavors to go save her. The Lost City has a lot going for it: a charming cast, genuinely funny moments, and some adrenaline-fueled adventure. The film harkens back to the days when such romcom adventures were more of a constant. Bullock and Tatum have the bickering down, but when things slow down between them, they're able to understand each other a lot better than before. As a team, they work well and they're the highlight of the film overall, with their comedic timing being especially worth noting. Tatum really delivers as a man who's got his heart in the right place, even when he isn't the most intelligent of people. His rapport with both Bullock and Brad Pitt - whose role as Jack Trainer is smaller than the trailers would have one believe - is fantastic. The frustrated energy Bullock puts out is fabulous and the physical humor employed by Tatum underlines his comedic abilities well. If anything, The Lost City could have used a lot more heat between Bullock and Tatum, with only a couple of scenes making good use of their chemistry before the film moves on too quickly to the next thing. That said, the film is well-paced and, at one point, even surprising. Not all the humor lands, but it is so full with comedic moments that the audience will find themselves laughing more often than not at the antics and reactions of the characters. Tatum's Alan, who has zero combat skills, takes to slapping Fairfax's henchmen when they attack and it's incredibly amusing to watch. Mostly, The Lost City is buoyed by Bullock and Tatum's"

Trying to walk in beauty pageant heels, tripping all over Ryan Reynolds while starkers, driving an LA bus hooked up to a bomb - Bullock has turned fretting into high art. In her new adventure-comedy THE LOST CITY, the Oscar-winning actress spends half the film stuck in the jungle in a sequined party frock, squirming and fumbling about with hilarious results. The rest of the film doesn't wear as well as Bullock working that garment, but the movie still manages to be escapist fun, a summer movie gracing us in late March. Bullock plays Loretta Sage, a successful author of romance-adventure novels, who's become bored with her prose and longs for genuine connection. Her husband, with whom she shared a taste for travel, died many years ago, and since his passing, Loretta has become more and more of a recluse. She can barely finish her latest book and she dreads having to go out and promote it, much to the chagrin of her gung-ho publicist Beth (a boisterous Da'Vine Joy Randolph). Loretta is especially irked that the junkets include Alan Caprison (Channing Tatum), the model who supplies the likeness for Dash, her literary hero on the book covers. Tatum's Alan is a self-centered actor, with long tresses a la Fabio, and a sense of self-importance that angers the author who must share the stage with this egotist. He doesn't know his finely sculpted butt from a hole in the ground and constantly steps on Loretta's efforts to explain the historical places that inspire her stories. One fan who does appreciate her findings is Abigail Fairfax (a hilariously priggish Daniel Radcliffe), the entitled offspring of a wealthy Murdoch-esque family. He wants her to help him find an ancient crown that will bring him fame and glory. When Loretta turns Fairfax down, he has his thugs kidnap her right from the junket, in that sequined 'onesie,' to force her help. Unfortunately, his thugs end up grabbing Alan too, and soon the odd couple ends up deep in the jungle searching for treasure at gunpoint. Clearly, directors Adam and Aaron Nee, who co-wrote the script with Owen Uziel and Dana Fox, love films like RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK to ROMANCING THE STONE to THE MUMMY and have served up an amusing homage to such adventure films. And soon enough, the film is incorporating all kinds of familiar but fun schtick including breathless escapes, winding chases through difficult terrain, and secret tombs with all kinds of revelations in hieroglyphics. Such tropes still play well, and Bullock and Tatum run with it, commenting on it all in real-time via their quippy banter. They both have a breezy way with the rapid-fire dialogue too, confident enough to throw away lines rather than underline them. And they're assured physical comedians too. Their best scene finds Loretta being forced to remove leeches from his almost naked body after an escape through the river. She is repulsed by"

What? Did I see that in a theater? I need to take a moment ... I'm having a major bout of (feeling old as all shit.) I'm going to take a brief walk and calm down. OK, I'm back. The Lost City is obviously an attempt at making a new Stone, but given how lame the finished product is, they would've been better off just remaking the original, or pulling a Ghostbusters: Afterlife retrofit reboot by making Sandra Bullock the daughter of Kathleen Turner's author from the original-because The Lost City has the same plot. But, no. Producers must think nobody in The Lost City target audience has even heard of Romancing the Stone, so they just re-made the movie, with a different name and characters. No need to acknowledge Stone. Romancing the Stone was enjoyable, but hackneyed, and that franchise played out after the less-successful sequel, The Jewel of the Nile. Films like Six Days, Seven Nights, starring Harrison Ford and Anne Heche, tried for a similar vibe in the late '90s, but did little to keep the genre alive. Wait ... when did Six Days, Seven Nights come out? Nearly a quarter-century ago? OK, hang on; I have to take another walk and regroup. Let me wrangle the dog. OK, back again. Perhaps the rom-com-adventure film was due for a fresh take, but The Lost City is anything but fresh: In every beat, it's a movie you have seen before. Bullock's author, Loretta, is kidnapped by a whiny rich guy (Daniel Radcliffe) who discovers a legit clue to a secret tomb he's been seeking while reading her books. Tatum plays the Fabio-like cover model who flies into action to rescue her. (Fabio jokes were old 30 years ago.) He enlists the help of a hero-type guy (Brad Pitt, apparently doing somebody a favor by appearing in this), and they form a rescue plan. The rescue attempt is hapless, and wannabe hilarity ensues. We get a scene in which leeches get into Tatum's pants. (Hello, Stand By Me! Let's rip you off, too.) We get Bullock and Tatum running around many locations-cheaply created by CGI. Pitt provides the film's only real laughs, making about 10 minutes of this film enjoyable. While the movie is milquetoast, Bullock and Tatum do make an appealing screen couple. They both have searching, simple qualities to their line deliveries that they've mastered; there are good moments between them that will make you wish they were in a better movie. It's also refreshing to see a Hollywood pairing with an older woman and a younger man. (Bullock is"
GCS_Doc7_LostCity,GCS,Comedy,Negative,Lost City,"In a setup and general vibe that reminded me of films like Romancing the Stone, The Lost City tells the story of frustrated romance novelist Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock), who has had her greatest and longest success writing the adventures of the same hero character, Dash, whose old-fashioned adventures have made up a series of books that Loretta is looking to wrap up with her latest title. After meeting with her book agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), she agrees to a small promotional tour but is tricked into doing her first Q&A with the male model Alan (something of a big, dumb but loyal dog, played by Channing Tatum), who has posed as Dash on the covers of all of her books. As the Q&A proves, Alan/Dash is more popular than Loretta, and she announces then and there that the series is over. As she storms out of the event, she is picked up/kidnapped and taken to meet an eccentric billionaire named Fairfax (a game and playful Daniel Radcliffe), who was pushed out of the family business, allowing him time to amass a huge collection of historical artifacts. The treasure he is currently seeking just happens to be the subject of Loretta's latest book and includes well-researched clues Fairfax wants enhanced so he can find the prized piece in a place called (The Lost City.) Alan happens to see Loretta get snatched up, and arranges to save her, even though he has no actual military or mercenary training. Wisely, he enlists the help of an actual mercenary named Trainer (Brad Pitt, in an extended cameo) to lead the mission. But when Trainer is taken out of the equation early on, Alan must rise to the occasion, rescue Loretta, and lead them both to safety. Directed by relative newcomers Adam and Aaron Nee (Band of Robbers), The Lost City is a bit of an obvious action-comedy that suffers a great deal once Pitt leaves the screen. But more importantly, the film also isn't especially funny. Bullock has set aside every ounce of on-screen charm she's ever possessed and just plays Loretta as a one-note grumpy, bitter, frustrated writer, who seems to miss the fact that an actual adventure is happening around her that is providing her with all of the moments her isolated life has been missing. And although she has sworn off reviving the Dash character, with the clear inspiration for her next novel playing out in front of her, she's too busy making fun of Alan to notice. The only thing worse than a humorless Sandra Bullock is Channing Tatum playing a character who lacks confidence to the degree Alan does. He's good looking, popular, and not completely without helpful ideas, yet he whimpers and seems afraid of Loretta. What fun! Since this is also a romantic journey, we assume there will be a few sparks between our leads, and there simply aren't. That being said, a few solid laughs show up from supporting characters like Pitt's Trainer, Randolph's"
GCS_Doc8_LostCity,GCS,Comedy,Negative,Lost City,"Hollywood used to be able to pull off this sort of romantic action-adventure with a degree of panache-witness the movie's obvious template, 1984's (Romancing the Stone)-but (The Lost City) suggests it's lost the touch. Despite the efforts of a game cast, the picture is a limp, laborious reminder of more enjoyable examples of the genre; even the effects are second-rate. Sandra Bullock brings her most downbeat, disgusted air to Loretta Sage, a popular romance novelist depressed over the death of her archaeologist husband but pushed by her publicist Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) into aggressively promoting her new book (The Lost City of D) alongside dim bulb cover model Alan Caprison (Channing Tatum), who dresses up as her handsome hero Dash McMahon and is secretly in love with her. After she bungles their show before an adoring audience, Loretta is kidnapped by wacked-out billionaire Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe), who believes that she can help him locate a fabled treasure in the titular city of her novel, which he's located on an island in the Atlantic-beside a volcano about to erupt. Both Beth and Alan take off after Loretta, she on a jaunt that will bring her into league with an amorous pilot (Oscar Nu-ez), and he with Jack Trainer (Brad Pitt), a true version of Dash who reluctantly allows Alan to accompany him. The latter two free Loretta from Fairfax's clutches, but that leaves her and Alan on the run in the jungle from him and his henchmen, who recapture them. Eventually they wind up in an underground portion of the city where the legendary treasure is supposed to be found. By the time Beth arrives to rescue them, they're in one another's arms. The makers of (The Lost City) work very hard to make it the grand frolic it's supposed to be, but nothing goes as planned. The problems begin with the script by Oren Uziel and Dana Fox, along with sibling directors Adam and Aaron Nee. It's a lazy piece of work, derivative by design but also woefully short of wit or charm. One doesn't expect even a semblance of logic in such a ramshackle construct, but how is one to understand how, in one moment, Loretta explains to Fairfax that's it's impossible to decipher a shard of a pictoglyph he's unearthed because doing so would require something akin to the Rosetta Stone that unlocked the key to understanding Egyptian hieroglyphics, only to have her present him with a translation the next morning? The instantaneous transformation of Caprison from klutzy wannabe to capable he-man is similarly jaw-dropping. Such deficiencies might have been compensated for by sparkling dialogue, but that doesn't happen; the unfunny rants handed to Radcliffe's smirking Fairfax are a signal case in point, but the banter between Loretta and Alan never approaches an (It Happened One Night) level.The mediocrity of the writing is amplified by the Nees' perfunctory direction; this is their first large-scale production, and much of the action is messy and lackadaisical. When they opt"
GCS_Doc9_LostCity,GCS,Comedy,Negative,Lost City,"(The Lost City) is a big mess - a big enough mess that it doesn't even get credit for knowing it's a mess - but it stars Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum, so that helps. It doesn't make it worth seeing, but it keeps the experience outside the realm of pain. Yet in one way the casting actually hurts: When actors who are really, really good at comedy apply themselves to dialogue that is really, really weak, you feel the strain. You feel the outline of the joke that wasn't there - and the vicarious embarrassment of a failed acrobatic turn that goes splat. String enough splat moments together, and you have a movie that could have been good, but isn't. The setup is fine. Bullock is Loretta, a romance novelist who has become reclusive since her husband's death. On a tour for her latest book, one she doesn't even like, she is paired with Alan (Tatum), a model who has appeared on the cover of all the books in her celebrated series. At this point, the Fabio-like model has more fans than Loretta, and Tatum is funny, tossing his (wigged) long blond hair and preening for his fans. One gets the sense that if the story just found a way to stay there, on that tour, the movie would have found its way to something enjoyable. But then the plot kicks in. A spoiled and somewhat demented young scion of the Fairfax media empire (Daniel Radcliffe) - these days, every evil character is a fictional rendition of someone from the Murdoch family - approaches Loretta with a proposition. Because of her knowledge of ancient languages, he wants her help finding the buried treasure of some lost civilization. That's a reasonable offer. He needs help translating clues to the treasure, and he's willing to pay her anything she asks. But she says no, so he kidnaps her and brings her to the island anyway. It would be missing the point of a movie like this to quibble too much about illogical turns of plot. But even in a goofy confection like (The Lost City,) it's hard not to notice when characters consistently behave against their own best interests, seemingly to help the screenwriters perpetuate the story. Over and over - I'd describe this in detail, but it wouldn't be worth reading - the characters are shoehorned into actions that don't make sense and that undercut both the story and the comedy. The movie has two bright spots. Brad Pitt makes a brief appearance as the man who can get them off the island. Bullock asks him how he happened to become so handsome and he answers, (My father was a weatherman.) Bullock and Tatum also have a funny moment, right after they accidentally force two bad guys on motorcycles to go off a cliff. In what plays like an ad lib, the two start finishing each other's sentences, talking guiltily about how they didn't really mean for that to happen."
GCS_Doc10_LostCity,GCS,Comedy,Negative,Lost City,"Am not sure what director brothers Adam Nee, and Aaron Nee had in mind when they first started making (The Lost City.) To me, it felt like it started off as a prank, where one of them might have suggested an idea of roping in Brad Pitt for a super-cool cameo as a sexy, undercover guy named Jack Trainer in what would essentially be an unofficial remake of Robert Zemeckis' gleefully pulpy but wholly watchable action-adventure (Romancing the Stone.) Then, they might have decided to cast the super-dashing Channing Tatum to play out an extension of his dumbfoolery from the Jump Street movies, and Sandra Bullock as well, Sandra Bullock from all her 90s movies. The result would make a fairly entertaining movie that would glide along on their chemistry alone. However, what we do get here is an over-stretched, unfunny, and terribly written film that doesn't know if it wants to be a treasure hunt adventure, a reworking of the damsel in distress trope, a moving-on from a grief tale, or a rom-com that ends with a kiss. Personally, I enjoy a really straightforward Hollywood adventure film. But, if that said film doesn't know how to land its jokes, make the adventure interesting, and allow the charm of its stars to make it work, I won't hold back my criticism. To put this plainly, Brad Pitt, who shows up in an extended 10-odd minute cameo is the only saving grace of this dumpster fire of a film. Most of all, this is a perfect setup for a hilarious ride, but the jokes feel like they have been stored in a broom closet for 20 years, and only now have the directors discovered that they might just make some A-listers say it and make it work. There are a few chuckles here and there, but mostly The Lost City is a 'lost' cause that is so eager to move forward that it keeps plunging into its stars' chemistry, cutting them in the midst of genuine moments by introducing another element that doesn't stick. Apart from the really stale script, the editing does more damage to the film than anything else. The camera never stays on the characters when they are having, or about to have a good laugh. Hell, it even cuts to a parallel and uninspiring plot of the agent coming to get her star, making all the conjured energy of Tatum's stupidness feel like it was all for nothing at all. Overall, The Lost City is a film that is best enjoyed only with a tub full of popcorn and movie-geek companions who can point out how fucked up the post-production would have been. For everyone else, it would mean that they are paying the price of a ticket only to see Brad Pitt enter and exit the frame in less time than they take to chew through their hotdogs. Anyway, Bullock stars as Loretta, a reclusive novelist who writes these pulpy treasure hunting adventures that are less"
WCU_Doc1_NoTimeToDie,WCU,Action,Positive,No Time To Die,"What a ride it has been for Daniel Craig. He first slid into the tuxedo of the dapper 007 back in 2006. Fifteen years and five movies later Craig wraps up his terrific run with the 25th installment in the James Bond franchise, (No Time to Die). Due to several reasons (a global pandemic chief among them), we haven't had a Bond film since 2015. That's a long time, but I'm happy to say it was well worth the wait.  I was pretty lukewarm on James Bond movies until Craig came along. His first entry (Casino Royale) blew me away. I like his second film, the flawed (Quantum of Solace) more than most. I loved his third movie (Skyfall) but was more mixed on his fourth, (Spectre). With (No Time to Die), Craig is given the chance to end his tenure on a sky-high note. And boy does he.  Directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, (No Time to Die) comes packaged with everything you want from a Bond movie - big action, even bigger characters, plenty of style, and a special dash of heart. But Craig's movies have added grit to that list. His Bond carries the weight of loss, and his pain often pushes him outside the bounds of agency protocol. That emotional burden and his willingness to cross the line are traits that set his 007 apart from all the rest.  This near $300 million sequel comes with a collection of old familiar faces as well as a few new ones. And once again this latest world-saving mission takes Bond (and us) to locations across the globe - Italy, Jamaica, Cuba, Norway, and of course London. And then you have the story itself which is not only thrilling blockbuster material, but it nails the tricky task of completing Daniel Craig's story arc. And it does it in an profoundly satisfying way.  The film begins with James having retired from MI6 and enjoying what resembles a normal life with Madeleine (a returning LÃ©a Seydoux). But while on a romantic getaway in the exquisitely shot Matera, Italy, the couple are reminded why they're always looking over their shoulders. Assassins sent by the nefarious crime syndicate Spectre ambush James leading to an exhilarating action sequence through the heart of the scenic city. Bond and Madeleine manage to escape, but he suspects her of betraying and the two split up.  Five years and one Billie Eilish Bond theme later, James is living in seclusion on a beach in Jamaica when he's contacted by old friend and CIA field officer Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright). Felix needs Bond's help tracking down a kidnapped scientist (David Dencik) who has developed a DNA-targeting bioweapon known as (Project Heracles). Obviously, in the wrong hands the bioweapon could be catastrophic. And those hands happen to belong to Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek), a soft-spoken yet vengeful terrorist leader who has an axe to grind with Spectre and has a rather gnarly connection to Madeleine's past. And just like that, Bond is back in the game.  From"
WCU_Doc2_NoTimeToDie,WCU,Action,Positive,No Time To Die,"The James Bond franchise is legendary, but it certainly has its peaks and valleys. Each Bond era brings a different style. Six actors have played the iconic character over the course of 25 movies. Daniel Craig's casting was initially met with backlash, but the 2006 masterpiece Casino Royale proved a lot of people wrong. No Time to Die is Craig's fifth and final time starring in the role. Two of the entries in Craig's era are disappointing, but No Time to Die doesn't join Quantum of Solace and Spectre on that list.  No Time to Die opens on a house in a snow-covered landscape. A masked assailant descends upon the poor inhabitants to hunt down a specific target. The introduction plays out like a horror movie, including a home invasion and a creepy-masked killer. However, the movie quickly changes gears as Bond and Madeleine (LÃ©a Seydoux) live their days together. The spy discovers that there's a lot he doesn't know about her past. Now, it's coming back to haunt them. Their volatile relationship is at the center of No Time to Die. Madeleine was previously introduced, but she's given a much stronger identity here. However, the focus doesn't shift from Bond.  No Time to Die is abundantly aware of the fact that this is Craig's final outing. It seeks to tie up the loose ends on this iteration of Bond in the most respectful ways possible. The screenplay successfully adds more depth to the character by emphasizing both his internal and external struggles. The womanizer spy is much more focused on monogamy and has difficulty trusting any of the women in his life after Madeleine. Meanwhile, he's remained off the grid and hasn't been in the field in quite some time. Bond is brought back into the spotlight that opens up old wounds and forces him to face the demons that he's been hiding from for years. The consequences could result in countless lives being lost around the world.  During Bond's time away from the field, a lot has changed. For example, Nomi (Lashana Lynch) has taken the codename ""007,' who also has the cool confidence that Bond lost years ago. Another character is brought into the fold named Paloma (Ana de Armas). Both of these ladies are absolute badasses. However, their stories aren't at the forefront. In fact, de Armas has essentially a glorified cameo that will have audiences demanding a Paloma spinoff. She delivers such immense personality and fun during her brief presence that is sure to stick with viewers. Meanwhile, Nomi gets a little bit of extra screen time, allowing the character to exhibit a small amount of growth. Some other characters reprise their roles, but make no mistake that this is Craig's journey. Everybody else is simply along for the ride.  Rami Malek stars as the antagonist. His mask gives him a creepy aesthetic, but that's the most that can be said about him. He's certainly the least interesting antagonist in Craig's Bond era. However, No Time to Die doesn't"
WCU_Doc3_NoTimeToDie,WCU,Action,Positive,No Time To Die,"I've always graded films on how well they meet their aspirations. Not every film is trying to be Citizen Kane or Lawrence Of Arabia, so the only accurate benchmark to measure a film against is how successfully it achieves what it is trying to achieve.  No Time To Die is trying to do a lot of things. It's trying to wrap up the Daniel Craig era of Bond, while also give Craig a fitting farewell that matches his brilliant entry to the franchise (Casino Royale, which is the best Bond film for my money). It's also trying to push the series into places its never been and continue its modernisation, while also maintaining the essential 007-ness of it all. And it wants to be a damned good Bond film.  No Time To Die is all those things. It achieves every goal, and does so with heart, grit, guts and the occasional wry smile. It's a continuation of the changes that have been evident in the series with every passing decade, but it's also exceedingly worthy of carrying the 007 licence. In short, this will go down as one of the best Bond films of all time.  It certainly carries one of the most Bond-worthy plots - the villainous Lyutsifer Safin (Malek) has taken control of a diabolical superweapon with the capacity to selectively wipe out anyone he wants, one family at a time. Naturally, it's up to Bond to stop him.  What's impressive about No Time To Die is the way it weaves this typical storyline among the threads of the connections Craig's Bond has made along the way. It ups the stakes like no 007 movie before - not just in a ""I'm trying to take over the world!"" megalomaniacal way, but in a personal way for Bond as well. It shows Bond in a new light, making him simultaneously stronger and more vulnerable than ever before.  Most of this comes down to the script, written by series regulars Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, along with director Fukunaga, and polished by Phoebe Waller-Bridge. But a lot of credit also has to go to Craig, who delivers the highs and lows beautifully. His light touch with humour along with his physicality and ruggedness have made him a great Bond, but its been his dramatic chops and emotional range that have set him apart, never more so than here.   Fukunaga's cinematography is outstanding, the set pieces are brilliant, and the ending is to die for. The cast regulars such as Whishaw, Harris, Fiennes and Wright are great, and the returnees Seydoux and Waltz are also excellent, but its de Armas and Lynch that threaten to walk away with the movie, especially de Armas, who lights up a wonderful sequence set in Cuba.   Series custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli have successful closed one Bond chapter and provided a blank slate for whoever is chosen to pick up the martini glass next. But whoever does so has some huge shoes to fill. No previous Bond has"
WCU_Doc4_NoTimeToDie,WCU,Action,Positive,No Time To Die,"Bond's a franchise that I very slowly came to respect, although I never missed one, whenever they got released, and I had my favourites, and my least favourites, and all the Roger Moore ones, in-between.  In other words, I found 007 entertaining, but never gave him a second thought after I left the theatre.  Sam Mendes's Skyfall (2012) was a gamechanger in that respect, as it went where no Bond had gone before, into that secret vulnerable space of a hyper-charged, almost caricatural masculinity, boldly hacking its airtight biography, right up to the first time its vital force was challenged by the absurd frailty of life. It did this with precision, depth, and fluidity reserved for an entirely different type of film, and that took me by surprise. It made me think differently of exquisitely crafted entertainment, and how film art can sometimes travel Concorde style.  Sometimes.  The Bonds of my youth never seemed to have a backstory. They simply were Bonds. Their job description was their characterisation. Born fully-formed in the prolific mind of a real-life spy, Ian Fleming, penned to spend their life on paper, they turned out to be perfectly tailored for the inherent mythomania of the silver screen. Those sharply dressed broad-shouldered men, with their state-of-the-art gadgets, aerodynamic cars, nonchalantly bedding unimaginably beautiful women, in the most clichÃ©d of luxurious settings, drinking martinis pedantically shaken, not stirred. And all this was just a sideline, too. Their steely focus was always their licence to kill, terminating over-the-top villains, along with unfortunate collateral, on Her Majesty's clock.  In truth, I fond Bond a glorified workaholic, and a bit boring. He was every young man's fantasy, but not mine.  Then came Daniel Craig as James Bond, and the man of mystery started to look like he could actually bleed. Profusely so. He also felt like a person with a real secret. Something small, devastating, and mundane, yet poisonous to the soul. That's when I got interested in the story. I though it somehow bore witness to a particular type of evaporating masculinity, compressed in-between two vastly opposed eras - a trained, stoic endurance in extremes of adversity, an agility of body and spirit, a quiet loyalty. The martial impulse to destroy and conquer transmuted into an ultimate sacrifice for others.  Not the hero we always wanted, but the hero we had.  And none of the Bonds pay homage to this perilously disappearing breed as directly as Cary Joji Fukunaga's No Time to Die (2021)  It's no coincidence that Fukunaga was the saturnine stunner vision behind Nic Pizzolatto's epic poetics in the seminal True Detective series. A milestone when it comes to both the history of the moving image and cinematic depictions of masculinity, as such.  No Time To Die still has the usual trappings of a Bond cosmology - a vindictive, profoundly creepy, Bond-obsessed villain, with a God-complex, a man named Lyutsifer (hint taken), played quite soulfully by a sullen Rami Malek; thugs with dodgy Eastern European accents (still the trope), although Dr Obruchev (David Dencik) turned out to"
WCU_Doc5_NoTimeToDie,WCU,Action,Positive,No Time To Die,"James Bond's biggest save in (No Time to Die) is the movie itself.  The 25th official 007 movie has all manner of vexations: a corpulent and convoluted plot, feeble villains and a running time that tests the strongest of bladders as it pushes three hours.  But so what? The film stars the essential Daniel Craig, who elevates franchise formula with skill and dedication the franchise hasn't always deserved.  This is Craig's finest moment as an actor, a magnificent performance of power and range that makes his Bond by far the most human and involving of the six actors to carry the name.  He saves (No Time to Die) from its excesses, justifying his decision to holster Bond's Walther PPK and rev his Aston Martin for a fifth and final time.  (Spectre) (2015) was supposed to be Craig's swan song as British MI6 agent Bond. Its wheezy narrative stitched the evil doings of the global cabal of the title, led by Christoph Waltz's cartoonish Blofeld, to a romance between 007 and sultry psychiatrist Dr. Madeleine Swann (LÃ©a Seydoux). The film ended happily but shakily, leaving no stirring reasons for a sequel.  We get one anyway, along with many faces old and new. Archrival Blofeld is back, supposedly kept from mischief inside a maximum-security prison that makes a mockery of the words (maximum) and (security.)  Blofeld is peeved, as is Bond, with a meddlesome new villain on the block: Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek), a scarred, masked and whispering psycho introduced in a pre-credits flashback. Safin is such a ghostly presence he doesn't crack the ice during a frozen-lake pursuit, although someone a third his size does slip into the water.  Safin and his scientific stooges have hatched a global threat that will chill the blood of viewers still mindful of the pandemic that delayed this film's release by 18 months. It's a bioweapon, designed to infect and kill millions of people, who are individually targeted by their DNA strands.  Yet the bioweapon's real-world resonance is as muted a threat as Safin, perhaps because it inevitably involves the all-too-familiar Bond trope of a secret laboratory on a remote island, with an army of goons and an array of countdown-to-Doomsday clocks. All the place needs is a hairless cat to stroke.  Long before we get there, there's much to muddle through in the film's greater concerns: betrayal, deception and a reckoning with the past.  The latter brings us momentarily back to a character from (Casino Royale,) the 2006 film that launched Craig as Bond: the tragically departed Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), Bond's former lover, whose grave he feels compelled to visit during a romantic car journey to Italy with new love Madeleine. He's retired from the spy game, opening his heart and leaving himself vulnerable.  Thus begins the film's most pulse-racing action sequence, a balletic chase of motorcycles and cars, directed with aplomb by franchise newcomer Cary Joji Fukunaga ((Beasts of No Nation,) TV's (True Detective)) and lensed by another new hand, Oscar-winning cinematographer Linus Sandgren ((La La Land)).  Fukunaga, who also co-wrote the screenplay, invests this"
WCU_Doc6_NoTimeToDie,WCU,Action,Negative,No Time To Die,"Cary Joji Fukunaga's No Time To Die is heavy-handed from the first scene, where James Bond (Daniel Craig) and his love-interest, Madeline (LÃ©a Seydoux) glide across Europe like the protagonists in an Imtiaz Ali movie. Except there's no song playing in the background which underlines their 'free spirit' ways. As they enter (what looks like) a town in Italy, she teases him for looking over his shoulder. He denies it, and says something profound about the 'past'. We see locals burning tiny pieces of paper, which we're told are past regrets and secrets, as a ritual.  Craig's Bond has been marinating in distrust and trauma since that climactic betrayal in Casino Royale, something that has arguably worked splendidly for the franchise, rooting it in real-world opacity. And to Craig's credit, he embodies the stiff upper-lipped Mi6 agent to perfection, instead of being the one firing zingers in every scene. Which is why it's shocking that the No Time To Die makers saddle him with melodramatic lines like (We all have our secrets, we just didn't get to yours yet.) But then again, that's probably the 'pitch' of Fukunaga's film. Now, only if they had shown more conviction to deliver a sappy finale for Craig's final outing as James Bond.  It's troubling how little No Time To Die does to separate itself from its predecessors. It's just another bloated Bond film, with call-backs from within the Bond franchise (since Craig got on board), 'exotic' landscapes, a supervillain with a God complex nursing genocidal ambitions. (Just another day,) Mallory tells Bond in one scene. There's the wry British humour on display, the umpteen close-ups of alcohol being served in a glass often gulped within seconds. Even the action scenes, though impressive in the moment, aren't particularly memorable like the parkour scene in Casino Royale. There's no weighty grief in the way Bond nurses a broken heart in Quantum of Solace, and surely none of the bitterness or existential dread from Skyfall.  Far from bearing Fukunaga's signature on it, No Time To Die seems like a dish that the director cooked up from a bullet-point recipe using each of the studio executive's favourite ingredients. Some humour? Add some of Ana De Armas and Daniel Craig's playful chemistry from Knives Out. Some action? Let's blow things up - a street in Cuba, a sailboat, or even an island. Some 'progressive' posturing? Let's get Lashana Lynch as the new 007 to impress the liberals. The decision really does feel that shallow, especially the way they handle Lynch, characterising her as someone chasing her own tail based on Bond's leads. The treatment meted out to Lynch at least answers the question about whether she is going to be trusted with the franchise. Nope.  Rami Malek, sporting a Noh mask and spotted skin, isn't nearly as creepy as his plain face in Mr Robot. Playing a character, who is an odd mix of Russian and Japanese heritage, means Malek gets ample room for his homegrown eccentricities. Malek hisses his lines like"
WCU_Doc7_NoTimeToDie,WCU,Action,Negative,No Time To Die,"A case of one mission too many, No Time to Die is a mediocre conclusion to the Daniel Craig era of James Bond movies, complete with a banal, confusing villainous performance from Rami Malek that suits the films tone.  A few years ago, Daniel Craig openly admitted that he had no desire to reprise the role of James Bond again. After all Spectre, for all its foibles, concluded with Bond walking away from the spy-life with new beau Dr. Madeline Swan (Lea Seydoux) by his side. It was the perfect bookend, yet (perfect bookend) is not allowed in a franchise that still has its star available and in peak physical condition. It's just a shame that No Time to Die squanders its farewell to the Daniel Craig era, with the 25th Bond one of the most lacklustre in story and stakes.  No Time to Die begins with Bond enjoying his post-007 life with Swan, before he is thrust back into secret agent mode when a new enemy, Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek) targets everyone Bond loves while (shock! horror!) putting into motion a plan to take over the world. Now back in MI6, Bond teams up with new agents in the form of disarming CIA operative Paloma (Ana de Armas) and a new 007 in Nomi (Lashana Lynch) in a bid to save the world and those he loves within it.  With a runtime of 163 minutes, there is a lot to consume in No Time to Die and a lot of it does not go down well. Director Cary Joji Fukunaga (Beasts of No Nation) continues the visual approach Sam Mendes developed with Skyfall and Spectre (respectfully), yet he is saddled with a screenplay overwrought and frustratingly complicated in its attempt to put a bow on the Daniel Craig-era of the James Bond story that plays for easy thrills and cheap payoffs.  The films core, a love story between Bond and Swan, is never given enough time to develop into a meaningful connection upon which the emotional stakes of love and betrayal can truly manifest into characters worth investing in. Making matters so much worse is the performance by Rami Malek as the ridiculously named Lyutsider Safin, a culturally confused villain of clenched jaw intensity and fetish for all things Japanese, spouting monologues of little comprehension and evoking even less emotion.  The action sequences are impressive in choreography and craft, the 53-year-old Craig (and his stunt team) maintaining his status as the best action-man Bond we've seen yet. Great too is Ava de Amos in a scene stealing performances as a wide-eyed CIA agent whose aim is as potent as her sex appeal.  Back to Daniel Craig. While he doesn't have the GOAT status of Sean Connery, the once dubbed (ugly Bond) has capped of his run as 007 with a strong turn both physical and emotional. It is just a shame that it couldn't be utilised in a better movie, with No Time to Die a send-off of convenience rather than deserving merit.  That No Time"
WCU_Doc8_NoTimeToDie,WCU,Action,Negative,No Time To Die,"Let the mourning begin.  In No Time to Die, James Bond is dead after 25 installments of the popular series about England's most glamorous secret agent-which means he will never be back-in his present form.  This is also Daniel Craig's fifth and final appearance as 007, so enjoy his previously indestructible stoicism for the last time, too.  Do this, I hasten to add, only if you are forever dedicated to a fictional action hero who, in your heart of hearts, can do no wrong.  In my opinion, he ran out of steam long ago, and now in retirement from Her Majesty's Secret Service, he has no charm, no wit, no sex appeal, no fatal allure for women and he's losing his hair. He dies from stray bullets, deja vu, stale dialogue and mixed reviews.  The car chases, the fight sequences (there are two), the helicopter shots, the never-ending guns and exploding warheads have all been done before.  This is probably to be expected.  You don't go to a James Bond movie to learn anything new. You go to ogle the latest girls, gadgets and exotic locations.  The entertainment values are ever apparent, the violence and bloodshed have a certain lift that both defines and defies imagination, and who would have it any other way?  You don't always remember what you saw the next day, but you know you had some fun.  This time the excitement fades like the popcorn that went with it, and for me, ennui comes on stealthy fingers.  No Time to Die may not be the worst James Bond movie ever made, but it's in heavy competition as the dullest one since Octopussy.  The film's sole distinction is the fact that it's the James Bond epic that finally manages to make 007 a crashing bore.  Directed with more boyish slobber than narrative coherence by Cary Joji Fukunaga from an over-crammed, self-consciously contrived script by no fewer than five writers,  No Time to Die hops and stumbles all over the place, but you can still write the plot on the head of a carpet tack.  It opens with a flashback to the Italian Alps where a mysterious thug in a white mask plods through the snow to murder a young Madeleine Swann's mother, but young Madeleine narrowly escapes.  Cut to the character, all grown up as LÃ©a Seydoux, who may or may not be married to a gooey-eyed, lovesick 007. (The movie is very vague about things that matter.)  After some high-speed racing through the mountains in his bulletproof Aston Martin, the two lovers are set upon by agents from the evil crime syndicate SPECTRE in the town square and he dumps Madeleine, thinking she betrayed him.  It's the end for Bond and Madeleine, but the movie is just beginning.  It helps to know your Ian Fleming history, including Bond's relationship with Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale, as well as the meaning of"
WCU_Doc9_NoTimeToDie,WCU,Action,Negative,No Time To Die,"Historically, the bad James Bond films have been judged so because they were just too wacky and silly. Fortunately, its utter disinterest in a hard and fast continuity meant that a deliciously hyperbolic film like A View to a Kill can erase a hackneyed Octopussy in under two years. Never before has a James Bond film been both technically well-executed and taken a more serious tack, yet still been an infuriating mess. So, congratulations, I guess, No Time to Die.  Borderline impenetrable if you haven't rewatched the first four films in the Daniel Craig-era arc, this 25th canonical Bond picks up where the roundly unloved Spectre finished, with Bond in seeming retirement with Madeleine Swann (Seydoux), and a lot of baggage from earlier films that now seems borderline absurd and needlessly convoluted. The big twist in the last film was that Blofeld (Waltz) was Bond's stepbrother and the cause of all his pain, but the villain this time is Malek as Lyutsifer Safin, a waffling, mumbling pseudophilosophical maniac with the standard grand plans for global domination. Meanwhile Bond ends up more alone than ever: out of MI5, replaced as 007 by a new agent (Lynch), and terribly sad about everything. Because the newer, more emotionally rounded Bond is just sad a lot.  Yet No Time to Die doesn't take the opportunity to examine Bond in a more stripped-down setting. Instead, it's the standard mix of globetrotting action, just slower and less engaging than ever before. Subplots go nowhere, new characters are dropped in with little payoff (exactly what purpose a side trip to Cuba with Ana de Armas' giddy young CIA rookie serves defies explanation), and much of the dialogue is simply meaningless - particularly every word out of Safin's mouth, which would just be nonsensical if it wasn't also delivered with all the gravitas and malice of a bus timetable. It's ponderous, tedious, and somehow both buried in continuity and determined to drop it all halfway through the story. It's not just recent Bond lore: there's a hamfisted musical sting that serves as a reference to On Her Majesty's Secret Service, further complicating the already convoluted timeline and inherently conflating two of Bond's dead exes.  It's this overstuffed storytelling, mixed with lackluster pacing, that renders No Time to Die a torturous misfire, and an utterly disappointing exit for Craig's Bond. I hate to say it, but this is Bond's Rise of Skywalker.  That's the saddest part of this era of 007. Craig had two of the best entries in the entire series, with Casino Royale establishing everything that was going to make him unique, and Skyfall hitting like a battering ram. His Bond was an educated assassin, charming and cold, violently loyal to Queen and Country but untrusting of both - just as Ian Fleming wrote him. Yet the last two films have written him into a melancholic corner, adding a supposed emotional depth that he simply doesn't need. Maybe the arc would have worked better across three films, giving some space to"
WCU_Doc10_NoTimeToDie,WCU,Action,Negative,No Time To Die,"No Time to Die is a horrid, endless chore using illusion technology to look like a movie. Its villain _ clothed in only the finest suits from the Steven Segal collection _ is so comically unwatchable he's all but completely edited out of the film. His name is Lyutsifer Safin. It's pronounced (Lucifer,) and his last name is practically (Satan.) Get it? Because he's evil. The only reason this isn't the most embarrassing thing Rami Malek has ever done is because he won an Oscar for a Bryan Singer movie.  No Time to Die is a hot dog made from the pig anuses passed over by other Bond movies. But things don't start off terribly! Director Cary Joji Fukunaga delivers an opening sequence that feels more like a claustrophobic, snowy cabin slasher film. Fun! The flashback gives way to an Italian vacay for Bond (Daniel Craig) and Madeleine Swann (LÃ©a Seydoux) that descends into a betrayal that hinges entirely on Madeleine repeatedly saying that she has to tell Bond something instead of actually telling him that thing. Not fun!  Cut to some years later: Bond is an island-dwelling alcohol sponge. Her Majesty even gave away his special spy locker number, 007, to Nomi (Lashana Lynch), the most interesting character in the film despite her sincerely saying this line of dialogue: (Do you know what time it is? Time to die!) One of the four credited writers on this is Phoebe Waller-Bridge. She almost certainly had nothing to do with that line, but it's fun to think she put it in there just to tweak the nips of the Bond enthusiasts who take this shit seriously.  The problem is, everything else is so, so, so serious. Watching James Bond repeatedly weep is so flagrantly disingenuous given the context and breadth of the character. Skyfall was masterful for the way in which it believably deconstructed and humanized the character, but No Time to Die feels like a gross attempt to procure unearned emotional responses. Not that James Bond has any previous recorded experience with forcibly soliciting things that aren't consensually offered.  The plot Macguffin is a nano-virus thing but then also an island made out of poison or something? Look, if you can remember what happens in all nearly three hours of this joyless slog, your recognition and retention are above superspy levels. Storylines are Frankensteined together; rotting, fetid flesh stitched by a great theme song and Craig's baby blues. Ana de Armas's scene is kinda fun? The opening credits featured guns shooting bullets that weave into DNA, which is what America's blood looks like under a microscope. That's cool, right?  Craig's Bond tenure can be reduced to the near-perfect Skyfall, the serviceable modern resurrection that was Casino Royale, and then things that fall under an umbrella of nonsense, like the very phrase Quantum of Solace. It's not quite clear how the exceptional Fukunaga, the genius Waller-Bridge, and the somehow-still-underrated-as-an-actor Craig got together to do...this... All that is clear, is that it is the last time any"
MDP_Doc1_Taxi,MDP,Action,Positive,Taxi,"As the title implies, most of the action of this movie takes place in a taxi in Tehran, Iran, with the cab driver being none other that the director of this movie himself! Very interesting social interactions and confessions about the present repressive Iranian regime. This movie is exciting and creatively used role reversals in criminals, working class and officers of the law that were portrayed.I loved this movie since I was a kid!  Watched as I've gotten older and it still cracks me up like no other. Queen Latifah's sarcasm and Jimmy Fallon's pure silliness is the perfect combo. Queen Latifah and Jerry Fallon paired surprisingly well as comedic champions. The best part... it is extremely simple and easy to follow. This was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. If you're in the mood for a good laugh... then you HAVE to see this one!! Jimmy Fallon did a great job as the worst cop in history... and Queen Latifah was wicked funny!!! She drives a taxi and he needs to be transported around to solve crimes. It's silly, and her old Checker cab can do tricks a muscle car couldn't do, which is funny! They are the dominant characters, and they handle their abundant screen time well. Both of them are personable and appealing so the time moves quickly. I nearly split my gut when Jimmy was trying to get out of his parking space with his mother's car!! I can't even count the amount of times I cracked up laughing... my neighbors must have thought I was going crazy or something!!! Movie made me want to be ""Queen"" for a day... that's for sure!!! I just think anyone that didn't like this movie is wound way to tight... it clearly was one of the films that you don't need to think about... just sit back and have a good laugh... it's what it is  all about!!! Life is too short, after all... jeez.... get a grip!!All the bad reviews have something to do with how it's a terrible remake of the French verison. Who cares? In regard to 2000s AMERICAN comedy, this movie is a classic. Stop taking life so seriously and laugh. sooo funny jimmy fallon hilarious he had me laughing great movie.....you walk away like a song that's stock in your head.. and start laughing again. great job..he definitely will be remembered.Lol... I watch film lot times and it brings back lots of childhood memories as it has a good story great actors and lots of humor. When I want to cheer up myself, I watch this movie. Some say that the acting is bad, but I think the actor have played their role dutifully.I would not put my bars too high for a comedy film. If you are expecting a film that could inspire you, it's probably not for you. All I can say that it is good for 2 hours of relax..This film is just awesome, and I highly"
MDP_Doc2_Taxi,MDP,Action,Positive,Taxi,"Andy Washburn (JIMMY FALLON) is a New York City detective who isn't very good at his job, especially when it comes to driving. After yet another accident, his boss and former girlfriend, Lt. Marta Robbins (JENNIFER ESPOSITO), takes away his license and reassigns him as a beat cop. Thus, when he hears of a Manhattan bank robbery, he doesn't commandeer a car, but instead gets Belle Williams (QUEEN LATIFAH) to drive him there. She's a former bike courier turned brand-new cabbie with a souped-up car and a desire to become a NASCAR driver one day. Accordingly, she has no problem keeping up with the exotic Vanessa (GISELE BÃœNDCHEN) and her three Brazilian bank robber accomplices who dress as men to pull off their heists. Andy and Belle get a look at the robbers, but don't manage to catch them, a point that doesn't impress Marta or newly arrived FBI Agent Mullins (CHRISTIAN KANE) who's now in charge of the case. He keeps Belle's cab as evidence, a point that doesn't sit well with her or her boyfriend Jesse (HENRY SIMMONS) when she doesn't show up for dinner with him. The two then form an unlikely alliance where Belle needs Andy to get her cab back and he needs her to help catch the bank robbers and thus repair his credibility in the department and with Marta. With some help from Andy's lush mom (ANN-MARGRET), the two set out to accomplish both missions. I watch Jimmy Fallon every night but was surprised that he starred in this movie. He is funny on Late Night TV and did a good job in this movie too. I think this was Jimmy Fallon's first starring role and he was very good, made me laugh. He is hilarious and amazing all by himself but when you add in Queen Latifah get ready to laugh until you cry. Queen Latifah was the life of this movie and she keeps you laughing. Her costars not so much! Silly comedy movie. Queen Latifa is hilarious and Ann Margaret is not far behind! A very good movie for the whole family. It is a perfect action-comedy movie and Queen Latiffah makes its plot simply funny. The queen is great in everything she does and this so so great!!!! But Jimmy Fallon brings out another funny side of her. A very involved movie, well written and directed, with lots non-stop action(s)! Good entertainment! I can always watch Taxi and my one of the funniest movie ever made . Any time I want to see funny movie I think of Taxi Iv watch it several times and laughed every time. Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon trying to stop bank robbers. I really enjoyed it! I am not sure of the bad ratings, I would definitely recommend this movie if you like silliness, car chases, then this movie is for you. Just a mindless fun movie and this movie never gets old. . I had to get a physical copy of this. "
MDP_Doc3_Taxi,MDP,Action,Positive,Taxi,"After five years of waiting, Belle Williams (Queen Latifah) is finally getting her hack license, and New York City had better watch out, because she makes the typical New York cabbie look like a driver's ed poster child. At the same time, Washburn (Jimmy Fallon), a bumbling New York City policeman, has just had his license taken away after totaling his third police car. When Washburn hears of a nearby bank robbery over his radio while walking a beat, he commandeers Belle's cab, and a new, extremely reckless partnership is born. When you rate a film, you have to consider the whole package, as an artwork. There's a lot more to it than whether you like the story or not, whether you thought it was funny or not, or whether you think it's realistic or not. For example, the cinematography in Taxi is incredible. Just the opening sequence alone, featuring ""Belle"" on a high speed, stunt-filled messenger bike ride through New York City makes the film worth a few points. The camera work and staging are stunning. There are all kinds of unique, subtle touches in the scene, like the shot of traffic where only the cabs are in color at first.  Lot of people don't like the film just because it's a remake of Gerard Pires' 1998 French film of the same name, or just because it's a Hollywood film, or just because they've changed the gender or dispositions of the characters, or because they're misunderstanding the idea of comedy and expecting realism. None of those facts make this an inherently bad film. The idea is that you're rating/reviewing a film, as an artwork, not making a political statement or rating cultural facts that have nothing to do with what's on the screen. I disagree that fiction is necessarily making claims about how the actual world happens to be. Especially comedy cannot be just realistic and still be funny. To be comedy, something has to be absurd, exaggerated, made ironic, and so on. In general, I'm not looking for realism in films, even though Taxi has some very interesting and funny jabs at the real New York City. There are people like Belle and Washburn here, even if less comically exaggerated. There are cabbies who drive like Belle--I had the misfortune of riding home from the Newark airport with one who was going 100 mph (160 kph) while weaving in and out of traffic, often straddling two lanes. I've seen number of people use Washburn's method of parallel parking (that's one of the reasons I pay for a garage instead).  A lot of people here live in converted warehouses, industrial spaces, and so on, often ""illegally"". Apartments are so expensive that this is often the only alternative. So it's not only funny and in character that Belle sleeps right next to her car, which she would rather work on in the middle of the night before she attends to her boyfriend, it's not that far removed from reality."
MDP_Doc4_Taxi,MDP,Action,Positive,Taxi," I enjoy watching movies with lots of twists and turns and the movie ""Taxi"" has a lot to offer.  Taxi is fiction, after all, and often cartoonish fiction at that. That's to be expected in much comedy. The opening bicycle ride isn't only amazing technically, it's funny _because_ it's supposed to be Queen Latifah on that bike! Jimmy Fallon's character was hilarious to me. He's a Clouseau-like bumbling nincompoop, but with a different kind of self-awareness that he's trying to veil with that special New York City ""street tough"" veneer. It perfectly skewers the public face that most people put on in the city. Latifah and Fallon complement each other in many ways. It was a pairing that I would have never thought of, but it is brilliant. There are a large number of scenes that will stand out in my mind for a long time.  And as good as Fallon and Latifah are, Ann Margaret, as Washburn's mother, nearly steals the scene every time she appears. She's a lovable drunk with an amicable, libertine outlook. Her apartment is a delight of tacky 1970s fashion, which brings up another exemplary technical aspect of the film--the production design.  But Taxi is also an exciting action/crime/thriller. The car chases often come close to those of another fantastic, unjustly underrated film--The Fast and The Furious (2001). The stunt driving is amazing. While the crime plot certainly isn't the focus of Taxi, it's more than just a throwaway device to propel our protagonists through their character development.  I'm not arguing that everyone should come away from Taxi believing that it's a 10 as I do. Tastes differ, and these characters, or these actors, in these kinds of situations with these personalities, as well as this kind of pacing, fancy camera work, etc., could be not quite to your taste. But the extremely low scores from some only show that those reviewers aren't taking their assumed role as film critics seriously (this is even true of some professionals--just read Roger Ebert's review of this film), and if they're not giving that much respect to the artform they're engaging with, it's difficult to see why anyone should give much respect or consideration to their views. To say that a film like Taxi is anywhere near the technical incompetence of a film like Back Woods (2001) or The Black (not Blair) Witch Project (2001), which is implied when you rate the film a 1 or 2, is beyond reproach. Surely, something bizarre is going on with the mainstream public opinion about this film as of this writing. While I can understand someone not thinking that Taxi is the best thing since sliced bread, it's unconscionable to give this film a 1 or 2. Anyone rating this film so low can't possibly be looking at the ""whole picture"", so to speak, or they must be watching with a ridiculous set of preconceptions/expectations. If you did happen to be looking for realism, the film has plenty."
MDP_Doc5_Taxi,MDP,Action,Positive,Taxi,"Taxi is the story of a clumsy, completely useless cop named Washburn. His major weakness happens to be that he can't drive at all. He ends up smashing into things and causing damage every time he gets behind the wheel. His Lieutenant and former girlfriend puts him on the walk beat and he hates it. He overhears the call for a robbery in progress and jumps into Belle's cab. A smart mouthed, brilliant driver who longs to be a Nascar racer. The story continues as a group of brilliantly fast and quick changing super models rob banks. Washburn is determined to catch these master thieves to prove himself and Belle agrees to help him in order to get her cab back. Even though I don't like car chases, this is funny. Taxi is another cop buddy film, but this time with a twist. This film pits a feisty cab driver and a klutzy, nervous cop together to try to capture a band of robbers who are hitting various banks in New York City. Though not up to par with other cop buddy films, this film is fun, and enjoyable. The action is fast, and the chase scenes are just awesome, everything The Italian Job should have been. The movie is fast and funny, ""The fast and furious"" mixed with a bit of ""Bringing down the house"". An interesting view at how people from totally different backgrounds meet in a situation that brings them together and they grow a friendship and help each other out to become better people in themselves. Washburn can drive now, and Williams gets to race, something she only dreamt of, and worked her whole life for. Sexy women as the bad ""guys"", a cab driver acting like a cop, a women as a lieutenant, and a man who shouldn't even be a cop, let alone have his license, an interesting combination to create one hell of a movie Latifah is amazing, she's funny, and has an amazing screen presence and makes a great action star. Even Jennifer Esposito as a supporting role as the Lieutenant is great. Even Model Gisele Bundchen, in her first movie role is the perfect bad guy and still does a better job than Fallon. Some of the scenes are  funny, and the movie runs at a brisk pace. Plus, the Brazilian models are just incredible to look at. There are some funny situations for the Brazilian viewers is to hear Ana Cristina de Oliveira speaking Portuguese with a strong accent from Portugal as if she were Brazilian. I laughed a lot with her pronunciation in Portuguese, which sounds very funny for us. Nonetheless Taxi is a good time because of the rest of the cast and the storyline is fast paced action. Latifah alone is worth watching. Overall worth checking out but certainly not for Fallon. For fans of the genre, you will not want to miss this one. Those looking for something with a little bit of substance, look elsewhere."
MDP_Doc6_Taxi,MDP,Action,Negative,Taxi,"An inept cop (Jimmy Fallon) loses his driver's license after totaling three cars, so when he stumbles across a bank robbery in progress, he has to commandeer a passing cab (driven by speed-demon Queen Latifah) to pursue the culprits, four sexy women who look like swimsuit models. Are you getting all this? The script by Robert Ben Garant, Thomas Lennon, and Jim Kouf, is adapted from a 1998 French film that was heavily influenced (says one reviewer) by TV's Starsky and Hutch and The Dukes of Hazzard. If you think you'd be willing to watch Latifah in anything, here's your chance to find out. Fallon has moments, but his character is a whining wimp that he quickly wears thin. Directed in a frenzy by Tim Story, the movie is a lame and witless excuse to string a lot of stunt driving together. This movie is just another run of the mill buddy cop movies, the plot is an excuse to have Jimmy Fallon and queen latefa team up , but this decision is  horrible this just makes the story as bad. Rating- 3/10 - the action scenes are pointless and have no effect on the story, the casting is very confusing and the comedy had absolutely parts that even made me laugh. This movie is a shameful copy of Taxi 2. I would say that 90% of this movie is Taxi 1 and Taxi 2. the only difference is that the cabbie is gender-swapped and this could be the worst movie that I've ever attempted to watch. I was embarrassed for all actors that were in the movie. another raciest movie about white people cant drive cant sing cant dance and be good cops. oh wait cant jump The best scene (at least one good comment about the title) is a scene involving Jennifer Esposito and Gisele BÃ¼ndchen, which had a sort of ""tension"" to it, that was funny and sexy at the same time! Funnily (maybe not so funny) enough, with the cast here, you'd be excused to think that it would be more often like that. But it's neither funny nor sexy ... and I'm not talking at the same time, at all! Except the one scene ... but that doesn't save the movie, which just is too long and has nothing going for it! It's a shame, because Jimmy Fallon can be funny, but here he's just annoying! My recommendation is to watch the French original. And just to make sure you get it right, i'll repeat myself: Watch the French original! It's so much better, starting from the cast (Queen Latifah is so miscast, it hurts), straight to the story/humor (it's just not right)! This is the American version of the French Taxi films and it suffers in comparison. I'm not kidding when I say that this a remake of the three French films since although the film is mainly a poor remake of the first film, it lifts sequences from the second and third films.    "
MDP_Doc7_Taxi,MDP,Action,Negative,Taxi,"A remake of the Luc Besson French flick of the same name, ""Taxi"" is a rather dull action comedy punctuated by some well-shot chase sequences - which are the only things that stick out in memory from this otherwise waste of cinematic space. The plot is limp - bumbling cop and lead footed new cabbie chase down four bank robbers who also happen to be Brazilian super models (although their reasons for the robberies remains as elusive as their desire for long-sleeved clothing). As a result you get action sequences punctuated with mismatched characters, neither of whom is particularly engaging. Latifah comes off better, having done movie comedy before and playing to her usual sassy strength - she's the kind of girl that's hard not to like, but even she struggles to get a laugh out of the all too thin material here that's begging for comedy and failing almost every time. Worse still, the pairing of her with Fallon's character seems so forced and hard to swallow that the much needed buddy chemistry so standard to these movies is just non-existent. Fallon is a big disappointment. He's been a sort of fun guy on SNL but he's just not a crossover movie comedian I'm sorry. The pale sweaty Fallon mugs constantly at the camera, trying desperately for laughs when just a simpler and more relaxed air about him would be so much better. Esposito as his ex turned boss holds her own far better, whilst the stunning looking Gisele Bundchen as the robbery leader has little to say but proves better than you'd expect for a first-time beauty onscreen. Ann Margaret provides the few genuine chuckles as Fallon's margarita-soaked mother. Kudos has to go to the action choreographer. The chase scenes look spectacular, kicking off with an awesome bike sprint through crowded Manhattan subways, trains, over bridge holes and amidst oncoming traffic. The scene helps set the pace for the over the top chases which fly through the streets with pace. The trouble here though is that it's all so unbelievable - Latifah's cab and the robber's red BMW drive around downtown Manhattan streets at top speed without once hitting a traffic jam let alone any major crowds or obstacles short of the occasional garbage truck. In the end while the action may be passable, the comedy utterly fails. The script has no real story (if you've seen the trailer you've seen all the plot points), whilst the characters are paper thin excuses to get the action going. Director Tim Story handled characters well in ""Barbershop,"" why couldn't he bring them into this limp duck. Take the bus instead. ""Taxi"" is an exercise in how not to make movies. The casting of Jimmy Fallon for the main role was a poor judgment by whoever decided to give the comedian this plum job; he is not even funny! The opening sequence involving the undercover operation where Washburn fakes to be a Cuban mafioso, shows that Mr. Fallon needs to reconsider future appearances in films. "
MDP_Doc8_Taxi,MDP,Action,Negative,Taxi,"Taxi casts Jimmy Fallon as Officer Andy Washburn, a bumbling cop who loses his drivers license after causing thousands of dollars worth of damage while in pursuit of a suspect. En route to a bank robbery, Washburn hails a cab driven by Belle (Queen Latifah) - where the two encounter four criminals that just happen to look like supermodels. Washburn, unable to drive himself to various crime scenes, enlists Belle's help in pursuing the perps - despite the protests of Washburn's Lieutenant (played by Jennifer Esposito). It's clear that Taxi is going for a Stakeout sort of vibe, mixing action sequences with wacky hijinks. And though it'd seem all the right ingredients are in place - aside from Fallon, Latifah can be funny when given the right material - there's virtually nothing here that works. Director Tim Story - whose most notable directorial effort thus far is the Ice Cube comedy Barbershop - quickly proves to be the absolute wrong choice for this material, infusing the film with incredibly obvious choices and a sense of style that's beyond bland. Example: in the sequence where we first see the models, the soundtrack blares Tone Loc's Wild Thing while Story's camera lingers on their bodies (in slow motion, no less!) That sort of thing is indicative of Story's astounding lack of imagination, with the filmmaker, time and again, taking the safest route possible (though, to be fair, this isn't exactly cutting edge material). Unbelievably, it took three people to write this mess - Ben Garant, Thomas Lennon, and Jim Kouf - and their script is peppered with dialogue that seems to exist only to further the tired storyline. Washburn perfectly exemplifies this, as it's impossible to believe a police officer could be this inept and keep his job for more than a few days out of the academy. Rather than use any actual police work to solve the case, Washburn instead relies on tips and suggestions garnered from friends and family (Columbo this guy isn't). And let's not even get into the plausibility of Belle, with her tricked-out taxicab (how on earth could a delivery person afford such a vehicle?) and ability to always be in the exact right place at the right time. Then again, it'd be easy enough to overlook such flaws if the film contained even one decent character (which it doesn't). The performances are generally of the sort of caliber one might expect from a movie of this sort, with Fallon delivering a grating, over-the-top performance that's absolutely devoid of charisma. (Latifah, on the other hand, isn't bad and deserves much, much better than this.) Unfortunately, this was a film that looked better in the trailers when the film was being promoted, prior to release. Taxi is, without a doubt, one of the worst films of the year and a disastrous start to Jimmy Fallon's movie stardom. If he's hoping for a career along the lines of Bill Murray, he'd better be a little more choosy in future."
MDP_Doc9_Taxi,MDP,Action,Negative,Taxi,"I'm tempted to just write ""This movie sucks"" and then go see the original again, but that wouldn't be very helpful to you guys. Here's why this movie sucks.  To sum up the movie, I steal from oshram-3 (One of the other comments) ""The plot of Taxi follows Detective Washburn (Jimmy Fallon, making his debut as a movie lead) and bike-messenger-turned-cab-driver Belle (Queen Latifah) as they inadvertently get tangled up with one another and have to figure out who is ripping off a series of Manhattan banks and try to catch them. Rounding out the cast (no pun intended) are Jennifer Esposito (you might remember her from Spin City) as Washburn's lieutenant, Marta, and supermodel Gisele Bundchen as the head hot chick.""  Luc Besson's action-comedy Taxi(1998) was a great movie, mostly due to decent acting, funny characters and social/cultural references. In this American remake, all that is gone.  The characters in themselves are severely less intricate than in Besson's original, and maybe the best of them all is gone. I am, of course, talking about the utterly insane police captain. Then again, of course the Americans would leave him out, since he's a parody of every single angry police chief in American movies. All that's left is Queen Latifah driving a taxi, and a cop that's just pathetic, and doesn't have that likable quality FrÃ©dÃ©ric Diefenthal had in the french version.  Also, the political correctness really shines through the gaps in this film. Every single strong character is a woman. The only guy in the entire core group of the movie is the awkward cop/disguise artist. The movie has been carefully constructed so it doesn't lash out at any particular groups in society, and by doing that, you lose the edge.  I see this movie as a blatant attempt to salvage careers and make some money on the fact that Americans don't like subtitles. It's also a classic example of what happens when you let lawyers and politically correct groups scare you out of doing things right. Avoid this film at all costs! This is just a very very cheap remake of the french movie by the same name. Being a big fan of that Taxi, I was intrigued to see what the Yanks had done with it. Watching it was painful, the only reason I watched till the end was to see how low they were going to go with this film. Queen Latifa's performance is the only redeeming aspect of this film, who does her best with an unoriginal, crass and cheap script. The best scenes are direct rip-offs of the original film and Jimmy Fallon is wasted on a one dimensional ridiculous character. Fallen is who really fails. He's just not funny in this. I never thought he was that great on SNL either. He needs to hire Will Ferrell's agent. FINAL VERDICT: Not worth your time. if possible, Go and see the original french film and give this one as wide a berth as you can!"
MDP_Doc10_Taxi,MDP,Action,Negative,Taxi,"Taxi is not only lame, but it's extremely unfunny. Its idea of humor is either Queen Latifah yelling at Jimmy Fallon for being the stupid, whiteboy he is, or a long and cartoonish chase scene. Usually in movies, chase scenes are used to either portray a climatic scene or the biggest scene in an action movie. Taxi abuses them and uses them as humor in its contrived and incoherent plot.  The story focuses on a New York City cabbie named Belle (Latifah) who has a loving boyfriend and has spent the last five years working on her cab and has added features a sportscar could only dream of. The story also focuses on a cop named Andy Washburn (Fallon),a bumbling cop who is now forbidden to drive his cop car after an accident.  Trying to catch a group of supermodel bank-robbers, Andy's only method of transportation is a taxi. For some reason he can't get a partner, who knows? Luckily, he gets into Belle's taxi. The rest of the film is mindless action mixed with stupidity, dim-witted characters, and stiff dialog.  The question that grew bigger and bigger when I was watching Taxi was how did Andy qualify to be a cop in the first place? He's completely idiotic and two nickels shy of a dollar. He's so brilliant in one scene he runs into oncoming traffic holding his badge in an effort...to get a taxi? Instead waving his hand out, he decided cutting into a crosswalk holding his badge and starting an unrealistic pileup would be the correct way to do such a thing.  My other question was where does Belle find all the time and money to buy and work on her taxi, while still getting money from customers. It's a five year process, but all that work on one car could cost tens of thousands. I don't think it's worth losing sleep or evaluating.  Also, why is Ann-Margret, the gorgeous woman from Bye Bye Birdie, Grumpy Old Men, Viva Las Vegas in this mess playing Andy's alcoholic mother? Is alcoholism really so funny that such an actress needs to play it unrealistically? I hate to say it, but those scenes with Ann-Margret were appalling to watch to say the least.  Why Tim Story wanted to direct such an inspired mess of a movie is foreign to me since two years prior to this he directed the fantastic urban film Barbershop about several grown men talking up their city barbershop, sharing experiences, and giving relationship advice. Barbershop was well done and well written. Everything Taxi isn't.  Taxi is sloppy, and its computer-generated car chases don't work in its favor. In a good movie like The Fast & The Furious, the car chases are more like drag races, and they don't take place on a heavily occupied NYC block where it looks completely unrealistic.. Also, there are other little minor jokes that don't involve chase scenes. In Taxi, that's all they got.This is an embarrassment in the film industry "
JGS_Doc1_Taken,JGS,Action,Positive,Taken,"""Taken's"" greatest asset resides within the perfectly cast Liam Neeson and the deliberate build of his fascinatingly merciless character. Rather than jump directly into the advertised plot, the film is careful to explore the anti-hero's troubled relationships and hint at the dark past that allows him to transform into the ruthlessly efficient soldier requisite for the task at hand. Halfway through the film, when audiences discover to what extent the protagonist is willing to go to accomplish his mission, it's impossible not to be engaged in his brutally unrelenting plight. Former government operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) has retired from his job of long hours and dangerous work in an attempt to reconnect with his estranged daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). But with a restrictive ex-wife (Famke Janssen) and his naturally overprotective impulses, he finds the young woman drifting further away. Not wanting to compound their strained relationship, Bryan reluctantly permits Kim to vacation in Paris, giving her more freedom than he's comfortable with. Things quickly spiral out of control when she's kidnapped by Albanian slave traders from her hotel room. Now, in a desperate and deadly quest, Bryan will stop at nothing to track down those responsible, to save his daughter from the clutches of a depraved organization. Luc Besson certainly has an obsession with shady men with checkered pasts, forced to delve into disturbing criminal underworlds to seek redemption and vigilante justice. Antiheroes come in many styles, and although some critics may scour at unoriginal aspects of Liam Neeson's Bryan, the man still knows how to be a badass. In the rescue of his daughter, he has no limits; this creates many unexpected scenes of exercising an iron will and a frightening determination, which finds a seemingly heroic man donning a guise of villainy. And yet, all of it feels righteous - it's a testament to character design when the hero can remain a hero even after viciously torturing criminals or shooting innocent people to force a few quick answers. He may not be entirely unique, but this hardboiled, unflinching ""preventer"" is simply fixating. ""Taken"" is an action film connoisseur's perfect guilty pleasure. Bubbling over with chase sequences, shootouts (the kind where the baddies supply all the firepower), and fistfights, it takes on a realism not found in many of the action-for-the-sake-of-action flicks of recent years. Bryan's hand-to-hand combat skills don't rely on flamboyant or showy martial arts, instead taking a more realistic approach, with plenty of one-hit takedowns and throat-chops that effectively subdue the enemy in a stealthier manner. The authenticity of it all may be negotiable, but it's refreshing to see simpler forms of attacking and defending - and it's certainly more believable when random gun-toting henchmen aren't prepared with perfect kung-fu fighting techniques to combat the specially trained protagonist. ""Taken"" prides itself on its serious, dark tone. The villains' atrocities are amplified by their detestable trade; they will receive no sympathy from viewers when they get what's coming to them. The hero is also rather remorseless,"
JGS_Doc2_Taken,JGS,Action,Positive,Taken,"Liam Neeson believed that ""Taken"" would be ""a little side road"" on his career, suspecting that the action film would likely go straight to video. He was wrong. The relatively low-budget thriller - it was made for about $25 million - was a runaway hit, netting more than $145 million domestically over nine weeks in the box-office top ten. The 20th highest-grossing film of 2009, ""Taken"" begat a pair of sequels, both of which also topped the box office and made decent money (though they fared better overseas than domestically). As for Neeson's career, the side road proved to be long and winding. Suddenly, the veteran was an action star - a decided change of pace for a guy until then associated with prestige fare like ""Schindler's List"" and soft-edged characters like his mourning widower in ""Love Actually."" To correct a common misconception, though, the transformation wasn't immediate. In the aftermath of ""Taken,"" Neeson continued on two of the roads he frequently trod in the aughts: big-budget tentpoles and little indie flicks. He appeared in ""Chloe"" and ""After.Life"" the next year, and continued lending his voice to the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" series (along with the English-language dub of the Studio Ghibli film ""Ponyo."") He did ""The A-Team"" and ""Clash of the Titans."" He had a very particular set of skills, but he wasn't yet willing to use them too often. The more robust career change set in a full two years after ""Taken,"" with Neeson taking the lead in ""Unknown"" in 2011 and both ""The Grey"" and ""Taken 2"" in 2012. (In fact, it was longer than that; ""Taken"" debuted overseas a full year before its US release, so it's better thought of as a 2008 film.) Three separate action flicks - ""Non-Stop,"" ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" and ""Taken 3"" - appeared in 2014, immediately followed by ""Run All Night"" in 2015. Now the side road was a full-on career path - one that continues to this day. As I write this, the middling action flick ""The Marksman,"" starring Neeson as a disgruntled Texan rancher and ex-Marine, is the number one movie in America. Somehow, it's the second Liam Neeson movie to top the box office since the pandemic began. The road from ""Taken"" to Liam Neeson, Action Workhorse may not have been direct, but ""Taken"" was certainly the starting point. While he does bring a physical intensity - mostly around the eyes and fists - to action roles, the real source of this trend is his voice. It's no accident that the ""I will find you and I will kill you"" speech has become a meme; hearing Neeson's comforting, whiskey-kissed voice turn direct and sinister is the key moment in ""Taken,"" the most memorable thing in a fundamentally formulaic film. It also helped ""Taken,"" particularly in word-of-mouth, that it is direct, quick and uncomplicated. Running a breezy 90 minutes, the film has no interest in side-plots or detailed world building; aside from some dispensable business with a corrupt"

How curious, then, that ""Taken,"" the one good film they do make (and a proven box office success overseas), not only gets pushed from its original release date, but then gets dumped into the cinematic cesspool of January with almost no marketing. Way to go, Fox. If there's any proof the studio really is being run by a bunch of monkeys, this is it, because ""Taken"" might just be one of the best action thrillers of the last decade. Liam Neeson stars as Bryan Mills, an ex-CIA agent who has given up his career and moved to Los Angeles in order to be closer to his 17-year-old daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), who now lives with her mother (Famke Janssen) and wealthy stepdad (Xander Berkeley). When Kim asks Bryan to sign a waiver allowing her to go on a month-long trip to Paris, he's hesitant at first, knowing full well of the dangers that exist in the world. Eventually, though, he agrees, but only under the condition that she follow his strict set of rules. As it turns out, Bryan's apprehensions were completely warranted, as Kim and her friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy) are snatched up within hours of setting foot in Paris by a group of traffickers in the prostitution trade. Now, Bryan has 96 hours to find his daughter before she's gone forever, and he'll use whatever means necessary to get her back. With the ""Bourne"" series on hiatus and the third installment of ""Transporter"" proving to be even more ridiculous than the last, it's nice to see a movie like ""Taken"" come along that incorporates elements of both franchises into a darker action thriller where the protagonist is more Jack Bauer and less James Bond. In fact, while the Fox drama may be trying to get away from the subject of torture by having its lead character constantly scrutinized for his questionable interrogation tactics, ""Taken"" embraces it with the most seat-squirming torture scene since ""Casino Royale."" Of course, Neeson's character doesn't have that much time to waste, so most of the movie adopts the kind of quick and sharp action that the ""Bourne"" series made famous. A chop to the throat here, a break of the neck there; whatever it takes to dispose of your enemy and keep moving. And move he does. Though the film takes some time to get going, once Neeson arrives in Paris, the 91-minute runtime flies by like its stuck on fast-forward. That's because the script (co-written by Luc Besson) only has one thing on its mind, and that's watching Liam Neeson beat the living shit out of anybody who gets in his way. Thankfully, the generic story is easier to swallow due to the involvement of Neeson, who lends the same kind of credibility to the role that Matt Damon did with"
JGS_Doc4_Taken,JGS,Action,Positive,Taken,"Taken is the grown-up, more mature brother of the ""The Transporter"" series.

Xander Berkeley), a billionaire hoping to replace Bryan in Kim's heart. Bryan is the kind of overbearing dad who wants you to call when you get to the theater, when the movie starts, when the movie ends and as you're pulling off the highway on the way home, just to make sure nothing has gone wrong. Against his better judgment - and in the hopes of endearing himself to his daughter - he signs off on her going to France for the summer, driving her to the airport with advice about where in France is safe and always to look out for trouble. This is what we call foreshadowing. Once Kim gets to France, the fun begins. Kidnapped by a cartel of Albanian human traffickers, she's destined for a life of prostitution and drug addiction unless her father can track her down in 96 hours, before she disappears for good. Here, Bryan switches into Jason Bourne mode - he's an expert at hand-to-hand combat, weapons usage, interrogation techniques and everything else a superspy needs to know to get the job done. Featuring some pretty graphic action sequences (as well as a harsh interrogation involving electricity, a metal chair and a bad guy with information to disgorge) ""Taken"" pushes the boundaries of its rating. How this movie sneaks in as a PG-13, while ""Slumdog Millionaire"" gets slapped with an R, I'll never understand. Mr. Neeson is fantastic as Bryan, perfectly bringing to life the sort of father every girl hates - at least until she winds up in a spot of trouble and needs someone with a backbone to pull her chestnuts out of the fire. The cadences in his line readings are engaging, as always; his dialogue comes off as almost lyrical. To say nothing of the fight scenes; for a guy entering his late 50s, Mr. Neeson is pretty impressive in the action sequences. He carries himself with an unassuming confidence that you rarely see except from those who actually have been in a scrape or three. The rest of the ""Taken"" cast is nondescript. There's no central villain in the film; Bryan simply disposes of scummy bad guy after scummy bad guy for the film's final 60 minutes. His Parisian counterpart, a former French intelligence officer who now works for the police, is the closest thing to a recurring character in the film's last two acts, and even he barely registers. Miss Grace is good as the bratty, insouciant little girl who wants to see the world and thinks she knows best, while Miss Janssen is woefully underused; she must be on-screen for less than 15 minutes.

He reluctantly agrees, on the condition that Kim calls him the second she's landed and every night during their stay. Every parent's worse nightmare is realized when Kim calls her father open their arrival at the Paris apartment. There are no parents, the girls' trip was a mere set-up to follow U2 around Europe, and there's a knock at the door. Kim screams, terrified, men are in the apartment. They have grabbed her best friend and are coming for her. Bryan tells her not to fight them. He knows they will hurt her if she struggles. But he asks her to describe what she sees, anything to identify them. They have her...a mysterious voice picks up the phone. Brian, in a deadly calm manner, asks the foreign voice to let her go, or he will kill everyone is his way to find the kidnapper. The strange voice beckons him to try. And that is a mistake to taunt an elite CIA assassin. Taken is an uncompromising, visceral film. It delves into the horrifying world of female kidnapping and sex slavery. French director/writer Luc Besson pens the script and produces the film. His vision is not only to deliver a spectacularly brutal action film, but to show an otherwise ignorant populace the heinous crimes of the illegal sex trade. Taken grabs you from the opening and never relents. Bryan is unstoppable in his quest for his daughter. His journey takes him to Paris where he uncovers a world of astonishing criminality. But while the bad guys are despicable, the vengeance he unleashes on them is like the hammer of god. They get their comeuppance from a father who will not stop until he finds his precious daughter. Liam Neeson, known for his excellence as a dramatic actor, proves he has the chops to be the toughest action hero. His character is so lethal, and yet so understated, the performance shows how truly great Neeson is. Because there is no karate, no machine guns, no big explosions, just a death dealer exacting revenge in a cold-blooded way. And he is not superhuman. Mills gets more hurt, bloodier, the closer he gets to the truth of his daughter's kidnapping. Taken is an extremely violent and sexually explicit film. But it is not derogatory or overblown in any way. Its mere subject matter is a callous truth that the world chooses to ignore.

Kim is so irritating. Kim is so excitable and such a pampered flouncer to boot. 'Bryan,' I'd have said to him if I could, 'you're better off without her; so excitable and such a pampered flouncer to boot. Now, let's go eat.' But doting dads are doting dads, I guess, and there is just no stopping him, which is a shame, as what follows is a big sorry mess of the most clichÃ©ed, improbable and xenophobic kind.  'Bryan,' I'd have also said,' I am very hungry and if I don't have supper soon I shall faint.' I probably wouldn't have fainted - have yet to faint, ever - but I think I'd have tried anything, pulled out all the stops. Still, I wouldn't have added that I'd tear down the Eiffel Tower if I had to, as that's just silly.  The film opens in California; happy, sunny California where you are safe because bad, swarthy foreigners can't get to you. That's the feeling, anyway, and it is weird, I agree. After all, Besson is French and Neeson is Irish but there you have it. There must just be no accounting for pro-American fervour and sentimentalism sometimes, although an eye on the box office must help. Anyway, we are introduced to Bryan: big, tough Bryan who has retired early so he can live nearer to and get closer to 'Kimmy', who lives with his ex-wife and her husband, Stuart, a zillionaire. Stuart is always outclassing Bryan. Bryan gives Kim a karaoke machine for her 17th birthday. Stuart gives her a pony. Ouch! That clichÃ© always hurts. And, boy, does Kim squeal excitedly when she sees that pony. Kim, you are already thinking, deserves whatever is coming to her. Bring it on! Lay her out!  What is coming to Kim? Well, Kim wants to go on a trip to Paris with her friend Amanda, another pampered babe of the flouncing kind, but daddy won't have it. He knows the world and there are bad people out there, he tells Kim. Hell's bells, they probably lace the croissants with crack in Paris. Still, he eventually consents with strict warnings about phoning every ten minutes. So Kim and Amanda fly off for what would have been a lovely trip had they not been kidnapped by swarthy, sex-slave traffickers the moment they arrive. Seriously, they don't even get a chance to unpack. That's how evil Paris is. We know we are in France, by the way, because all the French men carry baguettes, which is always a sign.

JGS_Doc7_Taken,JGS,Action,Negative,Taken,"On the narrative level, Taken is a fairly routine action thriller about a retired CIA operative who is forced to break out his tools and flex his old skills when his virginal teenage daughter is kidnapped abroad by human traffickers. There is little to distinguish it from dozens of interchangeable straight-to-DVD concoctions except for the fact that is stars Liam Neeson, who brings an immediate sense of heavyweight gravitas to what could have easily been a lightweight central role filled by any run-of-the-mill B-list action star. Once you put the man who has played Oskar Schindler, Michael Collins, Rob Roy, Jean Valjean, and Qui-Gon Jinn--vastly disparate roles, to be sure, but all of which are unified by their underlying intensity--the film is inherently transformed into something meatier. It gives the illusion of emotional depth and complexity where, in fact, there is none, but it's still an effective ploy.  Unfortunately, the film itself doesn't quite live up to the dramatic heft provided by its star. Written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, who are now on their seventh collaboration after The Fifth Element (1997), Kiss of the Dragon (2001), Bandidas (2006), and the three Transporter films (2002-2008), Taken is fueled primarily by its sense righteous vengeance, which is highly contagious, especially in desperate times when audiences are looking for a cathartic release. Besson and Kamen provide plenty of irredeemable bad guys, including a group Armenian thugs who do the kidnapping, a group of soulless international businessmen (including an American) who wear tuxedoes and sip champagne while buying human bodies, and a corpulent Middle Eastern sheik whose wallowing girth marks him as the epitome of consumption takent to its grotesquely logical end. It's a rogue's gallery of depravity at all income levels, and Neeson's Bryan Mills blasts his way through all of them.  Yet, that is precisely where the film comes up short. At virtually every turn it feels like it's pulling punches and not delving into the potentially dangerous visual terrain its story and its attendant emotions are screaming for (part of this may be due to the editing of the film's international version to earn a PG-13 rating for U.S. distribution, but my gut tells me the film is missing more than just a few seconds on the cutting room floor). The violence is quite brutal and Mills proves that he is not above shooting an arguably innocent woman (in the arm, but still ...) if it means he has a better chance of recovering his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). But director Pierre Morel, one of Besson's protÃ©gÃ©s, keeps the violence visually restrained, which puts it in direct conflict with the film's underlying emotional premise. Besson has always had a soft spot for killers with a heart (see, especially, 1994's Leon), and Mills fits right in that category.  When we first meet him, he is first and foremost a father who has given up his dangerous black ops career to get closer to Kim, but finds"

If you're looking for a ransom, I can tell you, I don't have any money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills acquired over a very long career in the shadows, skills that make me a nightmare for people like you.

But wait. If you DO have such skills and someone overseas HAS taken your daughter and you ARE going to find him and kill him, do you tell him all that? Unless your goal is to scare him off, which hardly seems likely, why go all Dirty Liam on him?  That quibble is about the 467th most implausible thing about ""Taken,"" an extremely well made and wildly, jaw-droppingly, astonishingly unbelievable thriller from producer Luc Besson, who specializes in this sort of picture. (He directed ""The Professional,"" one of the weirdest and one of the best hitman movies ever made.) Neeson gives this picture more weight than it deserves with a first-rate performance as Bryan Mills, a former CIA operative who has retired so he move to Los Angeles and be near his 17-year-old daughter. Nice timing there, as 17 is just about the age when kids are pining for college and want to spend as little time as possible with their parents.  Maggie Grace is Kim, Famke Janssen is the obligatory ex-wife who keeps reminding Bryan he was NEVER AROUND FOR ANYTHING EVER, and Xander Berkeley is her new husband, an obscenely wealthy guy who gives Kimmy a horse that looks like Secretariat in his prime for her birthday party, which looks like something out of ""The Girls Next Door."" (Clueless Bryan shows up with a cheap karaoke machine.)  Against Bryan's better wishes, Kim and her girlfriend go off to Paris----and within about 45 minutes of their arrival, they've been kidnapped by an evil cabal of Albanians who want to turn them into drug-addicted sex slaves.  From one single recorded phone call with his daughter that transpired as the kidnappers close in on her, Bryan and his CIA friends are able to determine the identities of the kidnappers, the region in Albania where they're from, and much more.

And he's paid a price for his fists. Bryan once devoted so much concentration and energy to his job as a ""preventer"" (""I prevented bad things from happening"") that his wife (a wasted Famke Janssen, who usually plays these roles herself) left him for a rich California businessman and took their daughter with them. So Bryan retired, moved to Los Angeles to make up for the frayed relationship with his estranged daughter Kim and sacrificed his own career to be near her. All he does now is grill steaks for his buddies and work occasional security jobs like guarding pop stars at rock concerts. But old habits die hard, and Bryan has forgotten none of the special skills he learned from his years with the C.I.A.-a knowledge of weapons, wiretaps, deciphering secret codes, scaling buildings like Batman and wiping out anything that gets in his way without regret-if he suddenly needs them. When his virginal 17-year-old (huh? In L.A.?) embarks with her girlfriend on a whirlwind tour following the rock group U2 across Europe and, within hours of her arrival in Paris, gets kidnapped by Albanian white slavers, Bryan shifts into demolition mode and takes no prisoners. He may be a has-been, but within 96 hours he's torn down everything in Paris with his bare hands except the Eiffel Tower.  First, he leaves a message on the kidnappers' cell phone, which just happens to be lying under the bed where his daughter is hiding: ""I will look for you. I will find you. And I will kill you."" He does, of course, but not before he slam-dunks his way through the City of Light, turning it into darkness. Equipped with Uzis, knives, swords and even an electric chair, Bryan works without official supervision or an expense account, yet never seems to run out of steam or cash. And there is no limit to his ability to tap international phone lines, spark the ignition in foreign cars without keys and find new ways to torture and kill his victims. In one scene, when he fails to get the right answer from a man strapped to a chair in the middle of a brutal interrogation, he electrocutes him, filling the room with smoke, fire and the smell of burning flesh. Each new victim (including some of France's leading power players) only piques the simmering rage of a vengeful parent, and we all know that a dangerous secret agent with a mission makes for panic in the streets.

JGS_Doc10_Taken,JGS,Action,Negative,Taken,"The conundrum posed by ""Taken"" is as old as cinema itself. Do stars degrade themselves when they take a role in trash, or does their very presence redeem the folly, turning up something that glitters amid the dross? A trenchcoated Robert Mitchum, for instance, sauntered through the villainous Europe of ""Foreign Intrigue"" (1956), but his saunter is pretty much all that remains; the rest of the movie was forgettable to start with. Now we have another looming hulk, Liam Neeson, laying similar waste to a posse of un-American scoundrels. Like Mitchum, Neeson has shoulders so wide that you have to inspect the back of his jacket to make sure that he didn't leave the coat hanger in. Like Mitchum, too, he appears to move slowly, at his noble leisure, yet to act with daunting swiftness when the occasion demands. He is more alert than Mitchum, whose brand of cool verged on the narcoleptic, but both men lord it over their surroundings-not with a wink but with a bang. Why spoof the world when you can wreck it with a straight face?  In ""Taken,"" Neeson plays a former C.I.A. hand named Bryan Mills, who is divorced from his wife (Famke Janssen) and living in Los Angeles to be near his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). If there's one thing we've learned from ""California Dreamin',"" it's that seventeen-year-old daughters get into scrapes. And if there's one thing we've learned from ""24"" it's that anybody named Kim, with a father schooled in dirty work by the U.S. government, will have a large echo chamber where her brain is meant to be. Kim and a friend leave for a vacation in Europe, where, ignoring the advice of her father, they are abducted with such consummate speed that it might have been simpler if he had FedExed them directly to the kidnappers. Pausing only to borrow a private jet from his ex's slimy husband, Mills flies to Paris, where he proceeds to work his way, without mercy, through a personal alphabet of undesirable aliens. This being a brisk affair, of little more than ninety minutes, he gets only as far as Albanians and Arabs, but, if I were an innocent Bermudan, let alone a Belgian, I would be starting to get nervous about a sequel.  The producer and co-writer is Luc Besson, and the director is Pierre Morel, who made the superior ""District B13."" That had Paris under its fingernails, whereas ""Taken"" darts from one location to the next without probing the city that lies between the hot spots, although Neeson would argue that, once you learn to drive like a Parisian, the opportunities for sightseeing tend to flash past. His performance is the most perturbing thing in the film, even more so than its electrical-torture sequence or its revelations about sex-trafficking; Mills, like some older, vaster brother of Daniel Craig's James Bond, seems driven to-or, increasingly, driven by-acts of vengeance that are only obliquely related to the wrong that is being avenged.

I'm not saying there's a lot of similarity between the two movies other than its themes of dream vs. reality and it's lead star Leonardo DiCaprio but like Shutter Island it's a movie that thinks it's smarter than the audience and uses an obnoxious soundtrack to signal that something important is happening only at the end of it you realize you just wasted 2 1/2 hours of your life. Director Christopher Nolan likes odd material, he made his bones on the mind numbing, Memento before going mainstream with the last two Batman movies. Inception in many ways is like a Hollywood version of Memento. Almost like if Nolan had the money in the early days this is the film he would have made first.   I used to have a lot of nightmares when I was in High School and read a lot of books on the subject of dreams and how to master them and do feel like I can control my dreams - probably also explains why I'm partially an insomniac so I actually believe everything they do in the movie is possible and understand the concepts the movie talks about. Whenever I feel a nightmare coming on, I use the same techniques to force myself awake. So I'm not going to say I didn't like this movie because it was confusing but from the first few minutes into it, it completely fails to suck me in. I wanted to like this movie, I want to see a great summer movie but there's something about the material. First it's hard to connect with a movie when it tries so hard to ""fool"" you or to keep you guessing; is this a dream, is it not, is it a dream within a dream? Who cares? Just commit to something and get on with it. The movie opens almost like Shutter Island with DiCaprio's character washed up on the shore of an Island that seems out of time, to the sound of an over bearing soundtrack. A lot of stuff happens in the first few minutes of the film but none of it seemed important and that's the problem, during most of the main dream sequences there are usually three things happening at once so as an audience member I was never clear which was the dream and which was real and it made me not care about anything. Especially for the first 20 or 30 minutes, there's not much of a story at all, just Leonardo's character trying to track some guy down. We slowly find out that Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is some sort of thief whose expertise is stealing secrets from people's dreams. In 2 1/2 hours the movie never really explains how this came to be. But it takes great pains in explaining the theory behind"
DWH_Doc2_Inception,DWH,Action,Negative,Inception,"Director Christopher Nolan is such a master movie technician -- a combination of engineer, architect, game designer and God -- that it's startling to realize how constricted his vision is and how clumsily he tells stories. ""Inception,"" Nolan's first film since his mega-googolplex hit with ""The Dark Knight,"" and his first as a solo writer-director since the now-legendary puzzler ""Memento"" in 2000, is supposed to be a dreamscape movie. At one point, in fact, we travel with its central Scooby-gang of characters into a dream within a dream within a dream, and then into some deeper, still more unconscious, psychological limbo-state below that. Managing all these nested levels of narrative is a marvelously nerdy accomplishment, no doubt -- but this is the most tight-assed vision of the innermost human psyche I've ever seen. While Nolan's images are visually impressive and powered by state-of-the-art digital effects and accomplished stunt work, they're always ordered and organized with anal precision. They don't look or feel anything like dreams. (Or, at least, not like my dreams.) They look instead like mediocre action films from the '90s, or in the case of the supremely boring ski-patrol vs. Arctic fortress shootout found on Level Three, like the Alistair MacLean adaptation ""Ice Station Zebra"" from 1968. (With Rock Hudson! And Ernest Borgnine!) ""Inception"" may have been directed by Christopher Nolan, but Nolan's dreams are apparently directed by Michael Bay. OK, I know -- you want me to back off the high-minded analysis and tell you whether ""Inception"" is a good destination for those summer movie going dollars eager to leap out of your wallet. Sure, I guess so. It's a cool-looking action movie, carefully constructed and edited, that uses all kinds of nifty locations and a lot of portentous-sounding expositional yammering. It inhabits a Philip K. Dick-style universe of psychological warfare that suggests ""The Matrix,"" ""Total Recall"" and ""Minority Report"" -- all of them, by the way, better movies -- but it's fairer to call ""Inception"" a maze movie or a labyrinth movie than a puzzle movie. Because, as the wisecracking fellow critic sitting next to me observed, every time the story gets puzzling the characters call a timeout and explain it. So, yeah, if you approach ""Inception"" with lowered expectations it's a pretty good time. Problem is, there are no lowered expectations around Christopher Nolan, whose adherents have proclaimed him as the heir to Kubrick and Hitchcock and declared ""Inception"" a masterpiece. I don't want to get sidetracked here, but let me suggest that the comparisons aren't entirely misguided. They're just not helpful. Nolan has inherited some of Kubrick and Hitchcock's worst tendencies, most notably their defensive, compulsive inclination to work everything out about their stories and characters to the last detail, as if human beings and the world were algebraic or geometrical phenomena requiring a solution. But the mysterious power of Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" cannot be explained by the ludicrous official story revealed in the final act -- indeed, it nearly scotches the whole movie --"
DWH_Doc3_Inception,DWH,Action,Negative,Inception,"As a slick, all-out action thriller Christopher Nolan's much-anticipated Inception delivers its share of tense drama and more than its share of eye-catching spectacle. As a piece of psychological sci-fi, though, the Warner/Legendary project never quite achieves the mind-bending quality that distinguishes the most successful examples of that genre. So it may still take all of Warner's marketing savvy and Leonardo DiCaprio's star power to turn this pricey - reportedly $170m or more - venture into a significant profit maker.  The risky proposition gets its first test when it opens on July 16 in North America (with a PG-13 rating) and the UK. Competition will be especially stiff in the US and with stars apparently counting for less at the box office this summer Warner's deliberately cryptic marketing campaign will need to prove effective. In other markets (most of which get the film during the second half of July) DiCaprio and the big scale action will certainly sell tickets and the international locations and internationally-flavored supporting cast should provide an additional boost. DiCaprio's Dom Cobb is a top drawer 'extractor,' a corporate spy who steals business secrets by sneaking into the subconscious minds of executives during shared dream experiences. For reasons that are only revealed as the story unfolds, the globetrotting Cobb can't return to his home and family in the US. But when a powerful client offers to rectify that situation Cobb agrees to take on a special job - planting rather than extracting an idea by performing the nigh on impossible task of 'inception.'  Working from his own, apparently long in the works, screenplay, Nolan structures the film's first hour like a heist caper, though the mostly somber mood is more reminiscent of the writer-director's 2008 Batman blockbuster The Dark Knight. As Cobb assembles his team of specialists - among them a trusted lieutenant (Joseph Gordon-Levitt from 500 Days of Summer), a sassy architecture student (Juno's Ellen Page) and a sleazy forger (Bronson lead Tom Hardy) - the film goes through a few too many scenes of silly-sounding explanatory dialogue and awkward attempts at humor. Much more arresting are the scenes in which Cobb and his team enter their own or others' dreams. The dreamworld effects - particularly the shots of the city of Paris folding up on itself - are flawlessly realized and extremely impressive, though not as frequent as the film's trailers and ads suggest. In its final hour, Inception becomes more conventional and less imaginative. The rules of the dreamworld still frame the action - to complete their task Cobb and co have to enter dreams within dreams, risking descent into a long-lasting dream limbo - but they provide fewer surprises, for the team or the audience. Instead, the dream backdrop allows the film to become several films in one, with three action strands - one of them involving another impressive set-piece, a zero-gravity fight sequence - being intercut as the story approaches its climax. Threaded into the action, and crucial to the"
DWH_Doc4_Inception,DWH,Action,Negative,Inception,"I suppose how you feel about Inception depends on whether you compare it to Nolan's Batman movies, which I have not seen, or his brilliant breakout film, Memento, which I have seen more than once. Perhaps both of these comparisons are misguided and Inception should be evaluated in the company of other big budget, head-trippy futuristic fare, with or without sci-fi trappings; Minority Report, Vanilla Sky, Total Recall, Brazil, and no doubt lots of other stuff I've never seen. Be this as it may, I am inclined to compare Inception to Memento because the former so plainly presents itself as a thinking man's action thriller, with a complex psychological premise we are expected to find as engaging as the one around which Nolan constructed Memento. It would be easy merely to dismiss Inception's failure on this score as being the result of it saddling its complex psychological premise with way too much action thriller baggage. Clearly, the intense drama achieved by the low-budget, street life, daylight Noir of Memento is not even approximated by the capital-intensive, fantasy land, CGI overload of Inception. But the real problem with Inception has to do with its complex psychological premise in the first place. In the first place, it's truly not complex at all. Set aside all the mumbo-jumbo tech talk about how there are concentric rings of the unconscious that can be induced, invaded and controlled by others from without. What remains is the most banal, coffee-table Freudian stuff. So much smoke and mirrors about how to manipulate the inner workings of the mind through the power of suggestion, only to trot out and ride the tried and true hobbyhorse of a father figure fixation. Jesus, why not simply put the billionaire victim in intensive (and expensive) psychotherapy, let him take forever to get over daddy, and take over his inherited company while he's preoccupied on the couch. In the second place, the psychological premise is way too complex. On this score, the demands of the action thriller really are at fault. In order to establish the changing situations that facilitate the variety of thrilling action, the Byzantine architecture of the head-trippy plot takes on ever more inconsistent proportions that must be justified by ad hoc explanations in the dialogue. The constitutional articles of the psychological premise are continually undergoing congressional amendment. Just when being murdered in a dream is the mechanism for waking up in reality, this ceases to be the case and an entirely different mechanism is introduced. Just when there is definitely a mechanism of some sort - any sort - to ensure waking up in reality, this ceases to be the case and an entirely different and deeper ring of the unconscious is introduced, from which it may be impossible escape. The tolerance of the audience is over-taxed. And in the opinion of this taxpayer, the whole conceptual government deserves to be voted out of office. The incessant explanation of the psychological architecture saddles the action just as much"
DWH_Doc5_Inception,DWH,Action,Negative,Inception,"In this summer of also-ran blockbuster sequels only the kiddie fare like Toy Story 3 and the alternative movies like I Am Love and The Kids Are All Right have really thrilled me. Like other fans of big, effects-driven action pictures, I have been waiting for something to rhapsodize about-something to give me that roller-coaster thrill effect. Inception, from writer-director Christopher Nolan, certainly promised to live up to these expectations. The follow-up to Nolan's dazzling 2008 summer hit The Dark Knight, this epic action blockbuster would seem to have everything going for it. Inception is visually dazzling; stuffed with great action sequences; and acted by a gorgeous cast headed by Leonardo DiCaprio that includes queer audience faves Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. And it's not a sequel with a premise that's far from the standard-issue action blockbuster. So far so good. But the reality isn't quite as enervating as one would hope. To begin with, Nolan's propensity for gimmicky, unnecessarily complicated stories-witness Memento as Exhibit A-wraps his audience in so many layers that eventually even his characters onscreen cry ""Uncle!"" Second, if I see one more movie with a subplot that focuses on DiCaprio's character in emotional freefall due to guilt over the death of his wife (this year's Shutter Island and 2008's Revolutionary Road immediately spring to mind) I'm going to have nightmares myself. Third, the picture's too long. In this futuristic thriller, dream manipulation has become possible. DiCaprio plays Cobb, who leads a crack team of operatives into the dreams of wealthy clients and their targets to unearth subconscious secrets. (Talk about high-concept!) After being tested by Saito ( Ken Watanabe ) , a wealthy Japanese businessman, in the movie's opening sequence the group is hired to pull off an intricate job that involves ""inception""-or planting an idea in someone's head. The specific someone is Robert Fischer, Jr. (Cillian Murphy), the son of a dying business tycoon and Saito's biggest competitor, who will inherit the business. Saito wants Fischer to break up the corporation and hires Cobb & Co. to plant the idea in his head. Page is the dream architect brought in to construct the maze-like spaces of the multilayered dreams, all reality-based and all occurring simultaneously. Once the team goes in, it learns that Fischer has had training to block dream invaders and has dream security with weapons ready to fight off the mental attack. DiCaprio's late wife (played by Marion Cotillard) is inside one of the dreams, too, adding another level to the thick-as-molasses proceedings. By that point the movie has become so dense with the pretzel logic that Nolan has conjured up that when Page exclaims, ""Wait a minute. Whose subconscious are we going into?!"" you can't help but laugh in relief. If the characters are confused, imagine how the audience feels. And the dreamscapes don't have nearly the otherworld visual panache of The Cell, What Dreams May Come or even the Nightmare on Elm Street series (or, for that matter, 1984's Dreamscape). We"
DWH_Doc6_Inception,DWH,Action,Positive,Inception,"Following the blowout box office success of 2008's The Dark Knight (which grossed $535.2 million domestically and $1.1 billion worldwide) and the rampant raves it received (culminating in a posthumous Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Heath Ledger), Christopher Nolan was finally rightfully recognized as the adept auteur he had always been, gaining commendation from crowds and critics across the globe. Though Nolan was no freshman filmmaker - having made several acclaimed indies from 1998-2002 (Following, Memento, Insomnia) and beginning his blockbuster blitz with 2005's Batman Begins - The Dark Knight turned him into a national name, with Sue Kroll, president of Warner Bros.' worldwide marketing, even stating that ""Christopher Nolan [was now] a brand."" While the world waited with bated breath for Nolan's conclusion to his brilliant Batman trilogy, he had another project in mind he wanted to pursue before going back to Gotham City. Nolan initially pitched the idea for the intricate and inventive Inception to Warner Bros. back in 2001, but he wished to acquire more awareness on how to best bring ""larger-scale"" films to life before officially tackling this twisty tale; with two big-budget Batman flicks under his belt, the time had come to make his delirious dreams a reality (both literally and figuratively) and begin constructing his most complex chronicle yet. We have a little less than a month to wait until Nolan's eleventh feature film, Tenet, hits theaters (scheduled for Wednesday, August 12th), but to coincide with both that picture's first release date and Inception's 10th anniversary, the seventh edition of ""Flashback Films"" is dedicated to revisiting Nolan's ballsy 2010 blockbuster and investigating its influence on innovation in cinema over the past decade. Given that Tenet is seemingly quite similar to Inception in scale, scope, and story, there's no better way to put your anticipation for Nolan's latest effort at ease than by joining us to analyze one of his greatest achievements. Originally envisioned as a horror-tinged heist film about ""dream stealers,"" Nolan soon realized that Inception's plot lacked ""personal"" stakes and emotional investment; in a movie centered around memories and the mind, this was an obvious oversight. For the next nine to ten years, Nolan strained to smooth out his script, soon settling on a story that told of a ""dream thief"" named Cobb (to be played by the legendary Leonardo DiCaprio) who was called upon by a client to assemble a crew (composed of actors such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy) that could pull off the converse chore of instead planting an idea in an influential C.E.O.'s subconscious - this procedure would come to be known as ""inception."" Just as Inception's narrative follows its protagonists' twisty travels through ""dreams within dreams within dreams,"" Nolan additionally fine-tuned the film to jump from genre to genre to genre throughout its running time. When analyzed from afar, one can see that Inception has the suspenseful set-up of a heist film, the stupefying stunt work of an action adventure (most notably in that instantly"
DWH_Doc7_Inception,DWH,Action,Positive,Inception,"After the release of Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" back in 2010, I wrote a review on my earlier blog site praising the film. After several more viewings, I would continue to applaud this production and it was easily my favorite film of that year. But as excited as I was over ""Inception"", I still don't think my previous review did justice to what has become one of my favorite movies of all time. Yes, I said of all time! I still find ""Inception"" to be one of the most original and most ambitious movies I've ever seen. But ambition doesn't always equal a great movie. ""Inception"" not only aims high but it succeeds in creating a brilliant and unique picture that's unlike anything I've seen. It's hard to pigeonhole ""Inception"". It's a heist film, a tragic romance, science-fiction, and an action film. But the best thing is it uses all of these ingredients flawlessly. The bulk of its success can be traced right back to Nolan. For my money Christopher Nolan is one of our greatest working directors. He wrote, co-produced, and directed this film and I truly believe he's one of the only visionary filmmakers who could have pulled this off. It took him almost ten years to write and rewrite the script and it took the huge success of ""The Dark Knight"" to secure the big budget needed to make ""Inception"". But you sure can't argue with the results of the finished product. ""Inception"" ended its box office run making over $825 million worldwide. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, an actor Nolan had wanted to work with for some time. He plays ""Dom"" Cobb, a dream thief for lack of a better title. He, along with his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), are paid to infiltrate the subconscious of their targets via their dreams and steal information. When the dream extraction from a wealthy Japanese businessman named Saito (Ken Watanabe) goes wrong, Cobb and Arthur find out they were being tested. Instead of extracting information, Saito wants them to attempt inception on a business rival of his. The idea of inception is that instead of stealing information you plant it in the target's subconscious while they're dreaming. There are questions as to whether inception is even possible but Cobb is enticed to take the job when Saito promises to use his influence to clear Cobb's name of a mysterious murder charge that has kept him out of the United States and separated from his two children. To do the job Cobb needs a top-notch team of experts. Eames (Tom Hardy) is basically a forger or probably better described as an impersonator. Once inside a dream he has the ability to take on the identity of anyone. Ariadne (Ellen Page) is the architect. She is able to construct mental labyrinths inside the dreamer's subconscious. This is essential if the team is going to know their way around the dream. Yusuf (Dileep Rao) is basically the team's pharmacist. He's the one who"
DWH_Doc8_Inception,DWH,Action,Positive,Inception,"The scope of Christopher Nolan's on-screen ambition is seemingly limitless, particularly his relentless desire to destroy the accepted standard that a big Hollywood blockbuster is inherently mindless. He already proved his theory with The Dark Knight, and with Inception, he nails it again with his personal mix of cerebral celluloid cement and the mind-blowing action for which he is now equally revered. Forget the hype machine, and the wilfully obscure marketing campaign - quality filmmaking of this caliber, like Nolan's low budget sophomore film Memento with its equally mind-bending structure, can speak for itself. By now, anyone who's been chomping at the bit for any online snippet of information about Inception will have an idea - planted by the media in cahoots, no doubt - of what to expect from the plot, the tagline for which is ""Your mind is the scene of the crime"". It's a metaphysical thriller, in which Christopher Nolan explores a genuinely audacious idea - no doubt first created in his own enviable dreams - that he could set a film within the mind of sleeping dreamers - and we'd buy it. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Dom Cobb, an ""extractor"", whose expertise is extracting ideas and thoughts from inside the dreams of others has led to his exile from home, and his status as a wanted man for a crime he didn't commit. One last job could save him, but it's not to extract - instead, he has to plant an idea, a far trickier concept. It's a psychologically complex premise, insisting the audience flex their minds as they watch; this is not a film for the lazy. But neither is it too complicated to be wholly enjoyable, as some might label Memento. Nolan uses exposition sparingly, but each character that arrives on the scene explains each step, drawing the audience inextricably into the world of dreams that Nolan has imagined, so convincingly that there is little cause to question his rules - except of course, if such cleverness inspires you to stay alert for logic holes instead of willingly getting just a little bit dazed by the idea that at any one time, you're not entirely sure just which character's subconscious your attention is swimming in. There's humor and heart too, if less than one might want - possibly the weightiest criticism one could muster - with particular kudos going to Tom Hardy's ""forger"" Eames, a dreamscape impersonator providing much needed light relief from the action and heavy emotional themes of guilt, forgiveness and redemption with his droll patter and sly one liners. Nolan's world in Inception is one that could rival Burgess' Clockwork Orange in originality, with a specific vocabulary and a physics-bending set of rules that normalize an essentially insane idea, that we can wade around inside dreams, molding them, as Ellen Page's dream architect Ariadne (a not so subtle nod to the Greek figure who guides Theseus out of the labyrinth, essentially her task here) does, initially with innocence. ""It's just pure"
DWH_Doc9_Inception,DWH,Action,Positive,Inception,"Mind-blowing doesn't even begin to describe director Christopher Nolan's latest foray into the mystifying realm of the subconscious. Like ""Following"" and ""Memento"" before it, ""Inception"" builds upon several truly clever concepts; but where his previous efforts only alter the timelines and the chronology of the information the audience receives, this film also plays with time itself, expanding and adjusting it to suit the adventure and mystery. Add to that the film's focus on the already enigmatic nature of dreams and their Jungian infiltration, disruption, and manipulation by experts (both in front of and behind the camera) and the movie becomes so stunningly complex and thought-provoking that it practically demands repeat viewing - not because it's too confusing to absorb all the creative ideas the first time around, but because it's just so astonishingly brilliant. When asleep, the mind's defenses diminish, allowing infiltration and deception by those with the ability to navigate the intricacies of the subconscious. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is one such ""extractor"" whose experiences with dream sharing are both enlightening and tragic. A fugitive from the U.S. for his involvement in corporate espionage and his implication in murder, Cobb is presented with an offer he can't refuse: attempt a seemingly impossible undertaking of ""inception"" on a rival of energy magnate Saito (Ken Watanabe) in exchange for a chance to return home. But the task of planting an idea in someone's dream rather than stealing it requires intricate planning, forcing Cobb to recruit an ""architect,"" Ariadne (Ellen Page), a ""forger,"" Eames (Tom Hardy), a ""chemist,"" Yusuf (Dileep Rao), and longtime extracting partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) to help execute the complex operation. Once their meticulous mission begins, Cobb's dark past and their target's unexpected awareness threatens to tear apart their carefully fabricated realities. Those that make it out alive may never awaken to the truth. Few films can achieve the level of creativity in ""Inception,"" a masterwork of complexity, intelligence, and ambition. Dreams have always been an endlessly fascinating subject for movies, a concept that can be explored again and again without ever being repetitive or derivative (if handled correctly). With no rules, the possibilities are immeasurable, limited only by the minds of the designers. Writer/director Christopher Nolan uses this to fashion an unpredictable, intense, unknown, mazy world full of spellbinding visuals and consternating twists. Anything can happen and just about everything does. Although he's renowned for jumpstarting a new Batman series, Nolan is well on his way to being more highly recognized for his mind-numbing psychological thrillers. The film opens with a dream within a dream sequence to demonstrate a notion, to plant a seed of doubt in the viewer's acknowledgement of the unfolding events, and to introduce them to unique characters with a job that warrants plenty of explanation. With theories on extraction (retrieving information from a dream), inception (planting information in a dream), dream-sharing, the subconscious' emotional influence, limbo (dying in a dream), projections (inhabitants of a dream), instability, and suspicion, all presented rapidly, the mysteries and"
DWH_Doc10_Inception,DWH,Action,Positive,Inception,"Christopher Nolan's first original screenplay since Memento (and his first solo writing credit since Following, his debut feature), 2010 action caper Inception proved a major narrative and technical leap for the writer-director. While its action unfolds in dreamscapes, it remains heavily rooted in some of Nolan's more realist influences - primarily, heist films and 007 - resulting in a work that feels distinctly tactile and grounded, despite its surreal setting. By rooting the film in the literal, Nolan not only establishes familiar tension and physical stakes, he also grants recognizable physical form to various themes and anxieties explored throughout his work. In our latest deep dive into Nolan's filmography, we explore the myriad ways in which he created a multilayered, self-reflexive action film that fires on all cylinders, manipulating time through meticulous editing to deliver a hard-hitting cinematic experience. A key scene in any heist film involves the crew laying out their plan. If the target is a bank vault, and the path to get there is through a casino floor, then establishing all the limits, hurdles and eventual end-goals helps rope the audience into the action. We become participants in the heist, privy to the casino's floor plan, though unaware of what dangers lurk around its hidden corners; the Ocean's Trilogy, for instance, thrives on these meticulous setups, payoffs, and sudden turns. We know how our characters must execute their plan, and we know how each unexpected obstacle might hinder their success as soon as it appears. More importantly, we know what's at stake should our characters fail. By the time we get to Inception's snow-fortress climax - inspired by the 1969 Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret Service - all the film's pieces are in play. Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) watches the action through a sniper scope, as his target and unwitting comrade Fischer (Cillian Murphy) attempts to break into a bank vault housing his own subconscious, three dream-layers deep. They're racing against the clock as the van they're asleep in a few layers ""above"" plummets toward the water, and as Cobb's employer Saito (Ken Watanabe) - the only man who can get Cobb back to his children - bleeds out, at risk of having his mind trapped in limbo. Cobb shoots the numerous henchmen attempting to thwart Fischer, as he reminds Ariadne (Ellen Page) that these ""projections"" are simply manifestations of Fischer's subconscious. But as soon as Cobb's own projection of his deceased wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) drops down from the ceiling, the music cuts out. She arrives like a ""thud"" in the viewer's stomach, gun drawn at Fischer as he makes his way to the vault. We know, given the increasingly blurred lines between Cobb's dreams and his reality, that he may not be able to pull the trigger and stop her. His return home rests on this one decision. The film lays out its roadmap deftly from start to finish. Its opening minutes dramatize the mechanics of dream-sharing, and the relationships between ""dreams within dreams."" The"
LLQ_Doc1_AngelHasFallen,LLQ,Action,Negative,Angel Has Fallen ,"Ric Roman Waugh's Angel Has Fallen sees U.S. Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler)-having returned to his home turf after a trip across the pond-contending with more threats to international security. Mercifully jettisoning the Islamophobia of Babak Najafi's London Has Fallen, the film finds Mike framed for an assassination attempt on President Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman). And clearing his name appears to hinge, at least at first, on whether or not he learns to grapple with the physical and psychological toll of his previous exploits, as multiple concussions and spinal injuries have saddled him with insomnia and an addiction to painkillers. As a fleet of miniature drones slaughters Trumbull's security detail, it's impossible not to think of Mike's early interactions with his old Army Ranger buddy, Wade Jennings (Danny Huston), the head of a private military contractor. Angel Has Fallen introduces Wade openly lamenting that Trumbull's efforts to stop war profiteering have hurt his business. It's almost to the film's credit that Jennings's guilt is never in doubt, meaning that Mike's subsequent escape from custody and quest to clear his name are rooted solely in his having to contend with his traitorous friend's private army, and not some dull mystery centered around who set him up. Still, the film's framing of Mike as the most wanted man in America is clumsily executed. Given that his face is plastered on screens all over the country, you'd think that the man would be trying to avoid public exposure at all times. In practice, though, Mike is almost always in plain sight, never making any attempt to disguise himself, almost as if he's aware that no one ever seems to recognize him. The only exception to this rule is when he's held up by two armed, backwoods militiamen in Angel Has Fallen's most baffling scene; after all, when one imagines the sort of people who might be driven to an outraged citizen's arrest over an attack on a liberal, black president, one doesn't immediately think of white nationalists. Given the lack of significant impediment to Mike's movements, the film allows plenty of space for action thrills, but Waugh seems to have cobbled his set pieces together from a series of close-ups edited as if by random selection. And because of so much coherence-defying shot continuity, it's impossible to tell what's happening during any given skirmish. Even the nonviolent scenes are jittery and aggressive; a close-up at one point tracks a character picking up a phone with a whip pan so fast that the shot slips out of focus. Worst of all, though, are the special effects that mark the more grandiose set pieces, with smoke from massive explosions hanging statically in the air as a giant, solid mass and, in the film's rooftop climax, the obvious use of green screen revealing image artifacts around the actors' faces. It doesn't help that, three films into the Fallen series, Mike has almost paradoxically lost some of his dimensionality as a character. In an age"
LLQ_Doc2_AngelHasFallen,LLQ,Action,Negative,Angel Has Fallen ,"The sleepy, dopey action bonanza ""Angel Has Fallen"" is disappointing, and not just for the reasons you might expect. Being the second sequel to ""Olympus Has Fallen,"" ""Angel Has Fallen"" doesn't even have a high bar to clear. ""Olympus Has Fallen"" was a by-the-numbers revenge-fantasy about ruthless North Koreans and emasculated, savior-thirsty Americans that's mostly distinguished by its considerable displays of over-the-top violence. Basically, America is graphically imperiled for the sake of confirming a slogan coined by then-interim President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman): ""As a nation, we are never stronger than when we are tested."" ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is, at the very least, a credible survivalist wet dream. In that movie, America is (temporarily) made great again, but only after the Washington Monument is toppled, the President is tied up, and the Secretary of Defense is punched in the face and kicked in the belly, right before she's dragged across the floor as she defiantly screams the Pledge of Allegiance. To defeat the North Koreans, Banning does what no officially sanctioned US agents can: he kills a bunch of bad guys without any remorse or reprisal, like the North Korean hostage that he shoots in the head, just to spook the other North Korean agent he has tied up (""Your friend seemed like a funny guy""). ""Olympus Has Fallen"" isn't a good movie, but I couldn't stop watching it. By contrast: I couldn't wait to stop watching ""Angel Has Fallen,"" an indifferently assembled cash-in shot with way too many shaky, unfocused close-ups which seem designed to re-assure viewers of this otherwise bland drama's surface-deep intensity. Being a timid lament about contemporary American trust issues (the Russians are to blame, but almost incidentally), ""Angel Has Fallen"" sics Banning-now rickety from concussion-induced migraines and insomnia-on a group of disloyal American mercenaries led by, well, you'll figure that part out soon enough. The makers of ""Angel Has Fallen"" don't seem to care as much about their characters (or patriotic ass-whoopings) like their predecessors did. Instead, we get a few tentative signs of introspection from Banning-he's sick, has a family to protect, and an estranged dad, too!-that are immediately glossed over for the sake of pumping up a few flat set pieces that hail from the Tony Scott School of Frenzied Action Filmmaking, only they're not as dynamic or good-looking as Scott's jittery photography. If you're going to be mean-spirited and exploitative, at least do it convincingly. The makers of ""Angel Has Fallen"" struggle most when they have to make Banning look like a rebel who also knows that he must inevitably ""ride a desk"" to retirement. Their version of Banning is more like John McClane in ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" than in ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder."" He complains (and periodically shows symptoms) of the action-movie equivalent of PTSD, but never succumbs to those ailments, especially not when he needs to cut through handcuffs, light up a phalanx of armed mercs, or run away strategically. This is apparently what life is like"
LLQ_Doc3_AngelHasFallen,LLQ,Action,Negative,Angel Has Fallen ,"There is a certain mindless pleasure in the Fallen movies. Watching Gerard Butler muscle his way through increasingly preposterous obstacles as a Secret Service agent can be amusing and oddly transfixing at the same time. It's mass entertainment that makes a courtesy stop in theatres before ascending to its true calling: endless cable reruns. But whatever this franchise got away with in Olympus Has Fallen and then, miraculously, in the totally unnecessary and very unintentionally silly sequel London Has Fallen, it's clear that the well has run dry on this idea and character. Butler and the filmmakers sleepwalk their way through Angel Has Fallen, the third, and hopefully last, visit with agent Mike Banning. This time, the powers that be have decided to make Banning a fugitive. He's on the run after being falsely accused of orchestrating an assassination attempt on U.S. President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) that kills 18 Secret Service agents and leaves the commander in chief in a coma. There is a dizzying amount of plot thrown at Angel Has Fallen. Banning has a toddler daughter with wife Leah (Piper Perabo, subbing in for Radha Mitchell in the thankless ""worried wife"" role) and he's considering scaling back from dangerous field work for the sake of his family and his own health after too many concussions on the job. The Oval Office is having issues with someone leaking false information to the press, not to mention the looming threat of Russia, who we're told meddled in a recent election in the Fallen world. And then there are the private contractors, like Banning's old military friend Wade Jennings (Danny Huston), who are longing for the good old days of lucrative wars and government contracts. Oh and Nick Nolte, playing Banning's estranged father Clay, is living off the grid in the woods and having some regrets about leaving his wife and young child some years ago. These threads are all thrown together in this kitchen sink of a movie that is unforgivably dull for having so much going on at all times - and I haven't even had the opportunity or reason to mention that this film also has Tim Blake Nelson playing the vice-president and Jada Pinkett Smith as the FBI agent who is leading the hunt for Banning. It's too much and too little at the same time, and neither absurd nor exciting enough to maintain an audience's interest for two hours. Nolte is the only real saving grace as the wild-eyed and paranoid Vietnam veteran living in his little bunker in the West Virginia woods. He's the only one having fun with this material, but even so gets unceremoniously demoted for the final set-piece (although he does pop up again in a bizarre and kind of funny post-credits scene that has more spirit in two minutes than the entirety of Angel Has Fallen). Everyone else is either too serious or too bored or some joy-killing combination of the two. Directing this time is Ric Roman Waugh, a stuntman"
LLQ_Doc4_AngelHasFallen,LLQ,Action,Positive,Angel Has Fallen ,"Angel Has Fallen may not be appreciably better than the first two installments of this lower-middle-range Mission: Impossible wannabe franchise, but it's actually more fun - first and foremost because of a vastly amusing turn by Nick Nolte as Gerard Butler's eccentric Vietnam vet old coot father. Outfitted with a dizzying body count and robust R-rated mayhem, this late summer action entry brandishes a small war's worth of bloody violence and heavy artillery to lure boys young and old to theaters, where the 2013 and 2016 entries both landed in the $200 million box office range worldwide. The first thing you can't help but notice is that Butler is getting a bit puffy around the gills as he pushes 50; not only that, but the president's personal Secret Service macho man Mike Banning is experiencing disorienting dizzy spells that suggest that a move from the field to a desk job may be in order. Still, it doesn't take long for Banning to once again prove that one of him, however diminished he may be, is worth a dozen of anyone else when it comes to protecting the President of the United States, who, in a bit of wish-fulfillment fantasizing, is played by Morgan Freeman and not, let's say, by Alec Baldwin. In an elaborate set piece notable for its body count, President Allan Trumbull's entire security staff is wiped out while protecting the chief executive during a fishing expedition not far from Washington; only his personal bodyguard, Banning, manages to keep the president alive during this frightful onslaught by what look like brilliantly trained mercenaries. But what thanks does he get for his heroism? Instant blame for the whole bloody fiasco from Vice President Kirby (Tim Blake Nelson), who insists that Banning is in cahoots with the Russians, has him charged with the attempted murder of the president and is immediately sworn in as acting president. From here, screenwriters Robert Mark Kamen, Matt Cook and Ric Roman Waugh - the latter of whom also directed, as he did on the previous series entry - clearly spent most of their creative energy figuring out multiple ways in which Banning could wriggle out of seemingly inescapable predicaments, get caught or subdued again, then bust his way out to fight yet another day. Kirby's first hours as president don't go very well, as Banning slips through his fingers in short order. Waugh's background is as a stuntman, and he no doubt put a lot of his old cohorts to work on this one; bodies go flying every 20 minutes or so, as Banning at one point escapes in, of all things, a big rig, and you begin to think you're bearing witness to the reincarnation of Hal Needham. It's all utterly preposterous, and yet Waugh handles the big scenes pretty well, or at least well enough (and with sufficient self-aware humor) that you're willing to go along with Banning's mad attempt to elude the traitors and save the country from servitude to Russian-backed"
LLQ_Doc5_AngelHasFallen,LLQ,Action,Negative,Angel Has Fallen ,"No, you don't need to have seen ""Olympus Has Fallen"" and/or ""London Has Fallen"" to understand the eminently disposable third chapter of the Mike Banning chronicles. It's not that complicated: Gerard Butler is an elite Secret Service agent with a heart of gold and a face of raw meat, he's saved the free world a couple of times over the last few years, and he's forced to do it again. On the contrary, the only prerequisite for enjoying ""Angel Has Fallen"" - or at least for appreciating the essence of its potential appeal - is a fond nostalgia for old-school action movies. You know, the steroidal stuff that Hollywood churned out back when men were men, explosions were the only special effects that mattered, and the President of the United States going into a coma wasn't the best thing that could possibly happen to national security. Even in its best moments, the latest episode of Butler's low-rent franchise is nothing more than a feeble attempt to refurbish 20th-century shoot-em-ups with 21st-century anxieties. With some actual craft, a pinch more personality, and even a single moment that didn't feel like it was watered down from 100 better movies, ""Angel Has Fallen"" might have felt like a fond homage to a bygone era of blockbuster spectacle. Instead, it brings a mediocre series to a fittingly mediocre close, and sends the summer movie season running away with its tail between its legs. Butler, who seems almost deathly afraid of deviating from his archetype, reprises his iconic role as Agent Banning, a character defined by two things above all: His born-and-raised Americanness, and a barely concealed Scottish brogue. But Mike, like the genre his movie belongs to, is getting a bit long in the tooth. After surviving the uselessly shaky action sequence that opens ""Angel Has Fallen"" - a shoot-out revealed to be part of a training exercise operated by cash-strapped private military contractor Wade Jennings (a cigar-chomping Danny Huston) - Mike immediately retires to his SUV to pop a bunch of pain pills. Being an all-American alpha male is hard work, and those concussions and body blows are starting to add up. Mike's wife (the ever-reliable Piper Perabo, seamlessly replacing Radha Mitchell) is pushing him to holster his gun and accept a desk job running his department, but our hero is hesitant to leave the field. He still wants to feel like a man! And real men don't take high-paying administrative gigs so they can live to see their ridiculously adorable baby daughters grow up! Real men have so many spinal-cord injuries that they're one big sneeze away from being paralyzed for life! Wade refers to he and Mike as ""lions."" For these guys, it's not about patriotism or justice so much as it is about pride. Pride is in short supply for Mike, especially after the president he's sworn to protect is nearly killed in a drone strike during a fishing trip.

LLQ_Doc6_AngelHasFallen,LLQ,Action,Positive,Angel Has Fallen ,"Angel Has Fallen, opening this weekend courtesy of Lionsgate, is a curious political retcon. After two films that, implicitly or explicitly, seem targeted at the stereotypical Fox News viewership, this third film offers a mostly conventional action-adventure movie with politics closer to the MSNBC demographics. The film offers not a story of Americans under attack from scary foreigners but of a nation in danger from rich white dudes who would prefer to keep up the status quo of perpetual war for the sake of their own defense contracts. Simply put, if London Has Fallen was season six of 24, then Angel Has Fallen is closer in spirit to season 2, when the (black) president had to face down a government that wanted to go to war even under false pretenses. Say what you will about Jack Bauer's cultural legacy, but 24 was doing ""the Iraq invasion is a bad/immoral idea"" stories in early 2003, right as the war was beginning, way before it was safe or cool to do so in mainstream entertainment. While this seem more spoiler-y than I'm accustomed to being in a pre-release review, much of this is revealed in the first act. Besides, once Danny Huston shows up in the opening scene, you know what to expect. The movie doesn't even treat his ""reveal"" as a baddie as any kind of plot twist. I'm sure Mr. Huston is a lovely human being in real life, but, as an onscreen actor, he is arguably the least trustworthy man in the history of Hollywood. In terms of plot, all you need to know is that Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) is on the verge of getting a major promotion, but he's hiding issues stemming from work-related injuries and has taken to popping pills and visiting doctors on the sly to avoid worrying his co-workers and his family. After a drone attack nearly kills the president (Morgan Freeman, giving a fine Morgan Freeman performance), Banning finds himself blamed for the attack and forced to pull a Dr. Richard Kimble in order to clear his name and protect his country. He also eventually runs into his estranged survivalist father (Nick Nolte), who offers some key aid while providing a counterexample for why a desk job may not be the worst thing in the world. Anyway, Angel Has Fallen strips away much of the Die Hard tropes from the first two installments, even as its politics and ""Who are the baddies and why are they being bad?"" plot comes straight out of Roland Emmerich's painfully underseen/underrated White House Down. Yes, just as London Has Fallen copied the general plot structure (the hero secret service agent rescues the president and the two of them avoid the bad guys and save the day) of the other 2013 ""Die Hard in the White House"" movie, Angel Has Fallen has now co-opted its politics. The core story, the hero being framed for an attack on the people he has sworn to protect and forced to go"
LLQ_Doc7_AngelHasFallen,LLQ,Action,Positive,Angel Has Fallen ,"Perhaps you've been on a road trip where you thought you'd make it to your destination in time for lunch, but there was traffic or a detour, and the next thing you know it's 3:07 and you are starving. You pull over at a rest area and, no, gross, you aren't going to poison your bowels with Burger King, so you crunch down on that non-chain grilled chicken caesar wrap and it's like, hey, these tomatoes actually taste fresh, this dressing isn't globbed on, and there's a smidgen of care in the sear of these chicken strips. These bright moments are nothing to dismiss in life, and it's my major takeaway from Angel Has Fallen, a movie I barely knew existed 24 hours before I ended up in its weirdly captivating thrall. I saw 2013's Olympus Has Fallen, not that I remember it too well, and I skipped the sequel London Has Fallen, but I swear you don't need to have seen either of them. Gerard Butler, looking more and more like Russell Crowe's baby brother, is Action Hero Man in the guise of a secret service agent. He's the best there is, like Rambo but pro-government. He and the President (Morgan Freeman) are pals. Standing next to the leader of the free world on a fishing boat is technically work, but he likes it. Why not? They are bros and they've been through two action movies together. But trouble is brewing. Thanks to one exploded grenade in his face too many, Butler (whose character's extremely regular name is Mike Banning, but may as well be Chest Steel or something) has headaches and can't sleep. His wife (Piper Perabo) wants him to pack it in and ""ride a desk"" but his old army buddy/bellicose defense contractor with his own private killsquad college (Danny Huston) knows he'll never give up the job. Indeed, the two men sit in Adirondack chairs one evening, mooning over the good ol' days like they are ex-ball players, not warriors-for-hire who machine gun helicopter pilots until they are enveloped in flames. One day, Mike Banning is out with the Pres on his vacay and, like those weird balloons from the British series The Prisoner, very smart drone-bats appear over a lake, eviscerating the entire secret service detail. ""Holy shit!"" exclaimed the man next to me, who got into the screening for free. The President comes very close to dying in a fire, but Mike Banning saves him. He doesn't save himself, though, because we see the murderbats' POV (computers!) and his name was on a white list. He was never a target. There's something fishy about this assassination. When we get to the hospital the President is in a coma and Mike Banning wakes up with more than just a headache. His DNA is all over the van that launched the drones, and there's a bank account with Russian millions in it, too. He's being set up! Who will clear Mike Banning's name? Mike Banning will,"
LLQ_Doc8_AngelHasFallen,LLQ,Action,Negative,Angel Has Fallen ,"No one has ever accused a Gerard Butler action movie of being too smart, but ""Angel Has Fallen"" operates on such a level of half-considered logic and improbable motivations that even moderately well-mounted action can't distract audiences from how dumb it is. Returning for the third time to the role of Mike Banning, Butler at least addresses the threat of aging out of a surprisingly anemic landscape of C-grade movies that actually open nationwide in theaters, but director and co-writer Ric Roman Waugh (""Snitch"") seems more interested in defying his main character's reality than substantially exploring it in this political thriller that blends the most overworked and stale ideas from ""First Blood,"" ""The Fugitive"" and even ""The Bodyguard"" into a watery, tasteless, unfulfilling stew. Three years after the events of ""London Has Fallen,"" Mike Banning is poised for a promotion to head of the Secret Service under President Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman), an honorable leader frustrated by the leaks that inexplicably pour out of his inner circle. Banning isn't sure if he wants the job; despite a growing addiction to painkillers to get through daily life - much less his military exercises - he doesn't know if behind a desk is the best place for his skill set. But when an assassination attempt is made on the President's life and Banning is the only survivor from Trumbull's security detail, FBI agents Helen Thompson (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Ramirez (Joseph Millson) find a wealth of evidence pointing to Mike as the perpetrator. Awakening to discover Trumbull in a coma and himself declared Public Enemy No. 1, Banning reluctantly acquiesces to due process, only to be unexpectedly ""rescued"" by a shadowy group of mercenaries keen to cement him with the blame for the assassination attempt. But after realizing that Trumbull's death paves the way for a regime change in the White House - and a policy change that could make that mysterious organization very wealthy - Banning is forced to escape his captors and evade the authorities, even as he scrambles to protect his President and uncover the real perpetrators before they can finish the job. In terms of its politics, ""Angel Has Fallen"" is a movie that wants its cake and to eat it too, to use election interference and Russian influence as a timely plot motivator but feature a contemporary President who's indefatigably refined and thoughtful. But it's a split that proves fatal to the believability of its premise - starting with a commander-in-chief allied with a VP whose policies seem starkly opposite to his own, and then a decommissioned private American military force so determined or desperate to replenish service contracts that its leaders would flagrantly murder Americans, soldiers and citizens alike, by the dozens. The fact that two of Hollywood's most go-to actors for portraying suspicious characters, Tim Blake Nelson and Danny Huston, play the Vice President and one of Banning's former colleagues, Wade Jennings, only concentrates the audience's attention on ""twists"" that would, or maybe should be"
LLQ_Doc9_AngelHasFallen,LLQ,Action,Positive,Angel Has Fallen ,"Rare is the action-movie franchise that finds a way to improve by its third installment, and yet, Ric Roman Waugh's bare-bones Angel Has Fallen ends up being the best chapter in all the Gerard Butler-led bunch. Color me shocked. Part of this lies in the fact that the previous two installments in this explosive trilogy - the series-launching Olympus Has Fallen and its ludicrous sequel, London Has Fallen - weren't very good. In fact, had you asked me which ""White House In Peril"" picture released in 2013 would still be telling its story today, I'd have bet big money on Roland Emmerich's White House Down (if only because Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx seemed like better box office bets over Butler). Yet, here we are, still following the heroic exploits of Presidential bodyguard Mike Banning, a burly concoction of Kiefer Sutherland's Jack Bauer, Bruce Willis' John McClane and Clint Eastwood's Frank Horrigan from In The Line of Fire. Banning's a throwback on-screen hero, which is why it works that director Ric Roman Waugh has constructed a throwback action thriller around him, relying on practical stunts, tangible explosions, smaller-scale fights and good-old-fashioned car chases to make Angel Has Fallen the most credible and enjoyable film in the series to date. Mike Banning actually spends all of Angel lamenting his broken-down body. He never actually speaks the words, ""I'm too old for this shit,"" but he embodies the classic Lethal Weapon line in every frame of this film. His vulnerability is a welcome trait. Banning has been through the ringer protecting first The White House and, later, the entirety of London, so he's contemplating hanging up his detail. Those plans are cast aside when a new antagonist makes a high-tech attack on new world leader, President Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman), somehow framing Banning for the threat. That's one of the most preposterous plot turns in Angel Has Fallen, and poor Jada Pinkett Smith has to somehow sell the tough talk that anyone in the administration would doubt Banning's loyalty after the previous two films, or think he'd have a legitimate reason to want to eliminate Trumbull. Yet, without that line of bull, there'd be no story, thereby, no sequel. The ""twist"" sends Mike Banning, two-time world saver, on the lam, where he must out the true criminal element and prove his innocence, all while still fulfilling his moral duty to keep the President alive. Piper Perabo lends support via telephone calls as Mike's wife, Leah, while Nick freaking Nolte joins the fray in a welcome supporting part as Mike's off-the-grid father. But this is Butler's show, and he makes the most of the opportunity. I return to the point of Mike's vulnerability, an action-hero trope that has gone the way of the ""practical stunt"" in this current era of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson holding a helicopter in place with one arm as he poses in front of a green screen. (See Hobbs & Shaw for that visual. Or, you know, don't.) Angel"
LLQ_Doc10_AngelHasFallen,LLQ,Action,Positive,Angel Has Fallen ,"When you think of badass action heroes in film, there are some recognizable names that will immediately pop up: Ethan Hunt, James Bond, John McClane, John Wick, and... Mike Banning? Hollywood will force Gerard Butler into being an action hero whether we like it or not. The man has great charisma but can't be in a good movie to save his life, excluding the How to Train Your Dragon films. The ""Has Fallen"" series - I think that's what they're going by - has been one of the most bizarre franchises to ever exist in recent years. Let me share a story with you. My pops and I live in an area close to this county in New York called Valley Stream, and a few years back there was a shitty theater called 'Sunrise Cinemas'. It was one of those theaters that had a metal detector inside, auditoriums that smelled like a rusty bathroom, busted and uncomfortable seats, and popcorn that tasted so stale. The theater is closed down now (for obvious reasons), but back in 2013, when it was still running adequately, my dad took me to see Dreamworks' The Croods for my birthday. I love animated films and my dad thought I was too damn old for them, but he knew what he was getting into when he showered me with videos of Disney, Pixar, and Dreamworks movies as a kid while taking me to every other animated movie that would come out in theaters. We both liked it a lot, but he wanted to watch something else - something manlier - and few theaters down Olympus Has Fallen, the other new release of that weekend, was just starting. So, we walked in, took our seats, and had a blast. I mean, a mediocre action movie in a mediocre theater? That was perfection for us and we loved it. Never did I ever expect that, six years later, this measly action movie that kept getting compared to White House Down (another 2013 action film with the same premise) would garner two follow-ups, but here we are. To be fair, I didn't watch London Has Fallen simply because I just didn't care. Whenever an action film has a sequel they always bring the hero to Europe and chaos ensues. It happened in Taken and Die Hard and I personally wasn't emotionally ready to deal with that for Gerard Butler. So, now we're at Angel Has Fallen, a *sigh* third entry in the weirdest action trilogy of the 2000s. And you know what? It's... not that bad. After saving the White House and London from international terrorists, United States Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Butler) is now requested to become director of the Secret Service on behalf of President Allan Trumbull (Freeman), who apparently just took over after Benjamin Asher retired from his presidency, I guess. They never really address it, for his character (played by Aaron Eckhart) is completely absent in this. Unfortunately, Banning feels unworthy to take on"
KCM_Doc1_ItChapterTwo,KCM,Horror,Positive,It Chapter Two,"It Chapter Two is beautifully cathartic and emotionally rewarding. Now, usually that's not a sentence I would write to associate with a horror film, but it's surprisingly accurate in summing up the adventure that director Andy Muschietti takes us on. Whether its Ari Aster's Hereditary or Jordan Peele's Get Out and Us, there's no denying there has been a notable shift within the horror genre, focussing more on the emotional substance and its social and psychological effects than the traditional jump scare motifs.  To a certain extent, Muschietti's take on the Stephen King classic (with all of its richness and minus that controversial sex scene) has done well to align itself in that same company.  Given how traumatic Pennywise (Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd) can be with his deceptive smiles and evil manifestations, this is a therapeutic journey to conquer fears and defeat the clown.  And trust me, as someone who hates that clown ever since Tim Curry donned the suit and make-up in the TV miniseries, its thematic exploration felt necessary. And that's where we find ourselves, 27 years later with the Losers Club reforming to keep their 'blood oath' promise they made as kids.  The entire film is built like an epic blockbuster event that chucks in the kitchen sink equivalence of twists and turns.  But like a lot of Stephen King adaptations, its subject matter can be 'out there', but beyond the surface layer of scares which It adopts, elevating from the creepy to the horrifyingly graphic (and the occasional Meta references thrown in as a tribute), its focussed exploration is that childhood loss of innocence.  The coming of age vibes is strong as the plot transcends into adulthood with all of its negotiated difficulties and life struggles.  But it's genuinely surprising how poignant and reflective It Chapter Two is. Working best as a back-to-back experience (which I recommend), that wave of unexpected emotion lifts the film.  Drawing active parallels with Netflix's The Haunting of Hill House with its visual transitions, its switch between the grown-up adults and their young counterparts is instantaneous.  It leaves a celebrated nostalgia on the journey they've faced and their growing companionship as friends which you want to revisit.  But, you adore the set-up with their older selves, knowing they have to confront and reconcile with the generational trauma of their past.  It's an emotional beat often taken for granted, but as much it takes its time to establish those points, you relish their reconnecting journey, proving once again that they are the heart and soul of this film. Rightfully, the film deserves high praise with its casting.  Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Bill Hader, Isaiah Mustafa, Jay Ryan, Andy Bean and James Ransone comfortably match their young counterparts with ease, diminishing any hints of star power, but allows room for depth in their spot-on performances.  McAvoy mimics Bill's panic stutter that gets worse as the film escalates.  Chastain brings the confidence"
KCM_Doc2_ItChapterTwo,KCM,Horror,Positive,It Chapter Two,"What is it with clowns, eh? Pop culture's obsession with the painted jester has often seemed sinister, but back in 2016, something changed. A new craze had swept the world, with countless sightings of people dressed up as killer clowns, sometimes brandishing weapons and threatening passers-by. In California, one woman reported that a clown tried to snatch her baby daughter from her arms, while another man in Texas shared CCTV footage of a red-nosed prankster breaking into his home at night. They were crazy, unreal times. Enter It - the big-screen adaptation of Stephen King's classic 1986 novel. Largely indebted to the iconic '90s TV two-parter, It was a box office smash, traumatising a new generation of horror fans while raking in more money than ever before. The inevitable sequel was soon confirmed, It Chapter Two. But with two years to get over the fad and new movie Joker stealing all the headlines, has Pennywise let rip that throaty cackle for the last time? Set 27 years after the events of It, It Chapter Two finds the gang getting on with their lives. Most notably, Bill writes bestselling novels and funnyman Richie is now a famous comedian. The Losers' Club may have outgrown its moniker, but each character is haunted by their past. Eddie's new wife resembles his overbearing mother, Beverly's husband is a copy of her abusive father and now-hunky Ben can't escape his formative years as a chubby target for bullies. Eventually, a devastating phone call threatens to pull them back to Derry where Pennywise awaits. Played by Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd, the clown prince of mime is on top form here. Stuffed with deliciously creepy scenes, the film's mid-section follows each character as they revisit their most terrifying encounters with Pennywise. By the time we reach the epic climax, we've met baby-faced crab-wasps, mouldy decapitated heads which sing in a fish tank and a dead friend's noggin suspended by huge, furry spider's legs. Director AndrÃ©s Muschietti has been given full license to spook in this sequel - and It Chapter Two works best in its weirdest, most off-the-wall moments. Elsewhere, it's a smorgasbord of genres, packing in nods to history's greatest slasher, psychological, gross-out and zombie horrors. Love The Shining? You'll want to pay attention. There's even a hilarious Stephen King cameo, where the world's scariest writer plays a sassy antiques dealer in a Neil Young t-shirt. It's a horror nut's dream. The Losers' Club are all grown up in Muschietti's scare-laden sequel Cast-wise, the film's famous stars don't always live up to their reputations. James McAvoy and Jessica Chastain are fine individually, but Bill and Beverly share little chemistry. At the same time, Isaiah Mustafa is unconvincing as Mike and James Ransome's quirky take on hypochondriac Eddie sometimes feels like an impression. Fortunately, none of this matters because Bill Hader is a revelation. Funny, compelling and often moving, the Superbad star steals every scene he's in - which is most of them. When Hader's on screen, the movie"
KCM_Doc3_ItChapterTwo,KCM,Horror,Positive,It Chapter Two,"It's been two years since we last visited the doomed town of Derry, Maine. The Losers Club, the most lovable group of misfits there is, has since grown up and left the sleepy town, but the evil hasn't. They are called back into action by Mike Hanlon, who remained as the town's librarian. It has returned, and it wants the Losers. This time, they have to kill It for good. Andy Muschietti's It Chapter One was a bit of a sleeper hit. It became the highest grossing horror film of all-time that no-one saw coming, because everyone hates sequels and reboots. But Muschietti had all the right ingredients to make his reboot work; a great cast and understanding that Stephen King's 'unfilmable' gigantic novel is actually about friendship, and the pain of growing up, rather than the killer clown everyone remembers the original miniseries for. Muschietti returns to the director's chair to craft a sequel that goes bigger and bolder in every sense, while digging deep into It's mythology, and the dynamic between the adult Losers. It's a mixed bag, and not everything works quite as smoothly as it did the first time. Muschietti also relies too much on CGI for scares and monsters, but in the end he regains a steady hand to bring the story to a satisfying, and a surprisingly emotional, close. As predicted, the cast is impeccable. It says a lot when James McAvoy is somehow the least charismatic on?screen presence; that's how stacked and good this cast is. McAvoy isn't bad per se, he's just left in the shadow of other equally talented actors. Especially good are Bill Hader and James Ransone as Richie and Eddie. The forever bickering friends steal the show, and every scene they are in. Hader is a revelation here, turning in one of the best performances of his career. He's laugh?out-loud funny, but his performance is always grounded in tragedy and self?hatred. Ransone gets possibly the flashiest role as the germaphobic Eddie. He gets to have the most fun but make no mistake, there's a lot bubbling under the surface. Eddie's insecurity, while at times played for laughs, is a tragic thing and the character's arc might just be the best of the film, along with Richie's. Jessica Chastain is great as Beverly but doesn't leave much of a mark, much like McAvoy. Both seem to be on autopilot, which still produces good performances, but forgettable ones. Jay Ryan, a relatively unknown Australian actor, makes a great Ben Hanscom, especially when he's pining for Beverly. But unfortunately the character is often just a root for fat jokes. Partly this is due to the source material, but considering it's 2019, one would hope Muschietti would have handled it with more grace and sensitivity. Muschietti certainly has a particular style of CGI he prefers,the overly fake look, and long, wonky faces. There's no effort to make It's iterations look realistic, but it's a strange choice, and one that distances the viewer from"

Andy Muschietti's first It film was a huge commercial success, but made quite a few changes from the novel that did not entirely satisfy. Its take on the demonic clown Pennywise, a character still dominated by Tim Curry's theatrical performance in the 1990 miniseries, was rather too horrific and bleak, while a shift in setting from the 1950s to the 1980s felt a poor fit for Stephen King's original novel. A reduction in Mike's role in the narrative also hurt the film somewhat, weakening the story's sole person of colour for no easily justifiable reason. It: Chapter Two is set in the present day, and adapts the second half of King's lengthy novel. ""It"" has returned, and as the last remaining member of the Losers Club still living in Derry, Mike calls and begs his childhood friends to return. This sequel did not gain the popular audience or acclaim that its predecessor did, but personally I find it a much stronger film. With the benefit of age the protagonists have much more depth to them, and a strong cast of actors do an exceptional job of fleshing them out and showing how each has changed and developed in the intervening years. Particularly strong is Jessica Chastain - one of the USA's best contemporary actors - as Beverly: still a victim, but still fighting to escape a legacy of violence. Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd brings a much more comfortable and light tone to Pennywise, warming up the character to an extent and in doing so pulling away from the relentless horrors that made him difficult to believe in last time around. Clowns are naturally creepy characters - more so in the 1980s than the 1950s - and a screaming demonic monster as a clown made a mockery of the idea it could ever tempt a child into harm's way. This revised iteration is funnier, and more subtle where it counts: finally a temptation for which you can believe a child would fall. Stylishly shot, well paced, and overall very satisfying, It: Chapter Two feels like a strong improvement, and a solid slice of commercially-minded populist horror. It is imperfect in places - the climax struggles a little, and an early scene of two homosexual men being assaulted feels tonally misjudged - but overall it satisfies in a manner that the original film did not quite manage. Still, as a two-part re-opening of the Stephen King adaptation for business - there have been six new Stephen King film adaptations since It with 10 in development - it acquits itself remarkably well."
KCM_Doc5_ItChapterTwo,KCM,Horror,Positive,It Chapter Two,"Pennywise (Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd) is back. This time he's really, really angry. He has had time to stew on things as IT CHAPTER 2 picks up 27 years after the first film. While most of the kids from the Loser's Club have moved out of Derry, Maine, Mike (Isaiah Mustafa/Chosen Jacobs) has remained. Haunted by the events of the past, he keeps ever vigilant for IT's possible return. When mysterious disappearances begin occurring once again, Mike reaches out to his childhood friends to remind them of their promise to return to kill IT once and for all. I am happy to report that IT Chapter 2 is a worthy sequel to the first film, and in some ways even better. Bigger risks are taken, the violence is more unhinged and effective, scenes get more abstract and dreamlike, and it carries a surprising emotional weight. The film deftly jumps from present to past and back again thanks to a nimble script by Gary Dauberman and clear direction from Andy Muschietti. This necessitates employing the younger performers from the first film along with a new ensemble of expertly cast adult actors. The effect is consistency in character that adds a unique gravitas to the collective performances. We are first reintroduced to all of the Losers as they get the fateful call that pulls them back to their painful childhoods in Derry and the film begins. All but one of the Losers immediately hop onto planes and return home with the exception of Stanley (Andy Bean/Wyatt Oleff). Once back, the Losers meet for dinner at the Jade of the Orient. Each of the losers arrives and sizes one another up in their own way. Beverly (Jessica Chastain/Sophia Lillis), Bill (James McAvoy/Jaeden Martell) Richie (Bill Hader/Finn Wolfhard), Eddie (James Ransone /Jack Dylan Grazer),  and Ben (Jay Ryan/Jeremy Ray Taylor) sit at a round table, reconnecting until a lingering feeling of dread takes hold again. As they all slowly recall the evil they faced 27 years before, Mike attempts to convince them that it is their obligation to stay, confront the evil, and defeat it for good. The initial response is to run, screaming into the night and never look back. After a bit of convincing, they all realize that the only way to fight fear is to confront it. Dauberman's script goes to great pains to include the rich mythos of IT as an ancient, cosmic creature that has tormented the area for hundreds of years without sacrificing narrative momentum. The film even goes so far as to touch on the local Native Americans tactics in facing off with the creature and how that could help the Losers. Saddled with their marching orders, each adult Loser heads off to seek a ""token"" to be used in a ritual that will destroy IT for good. As this plays out, Pennywise lets the Losers know he is aware they have returned. This leads to one particularly effective scene of Beverly returning to her childhood home only"
KCM_Doc6_ItChapterTwo,KCM,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two,"The first It film from 2017 covered roughly half the material in Stephen King's epic horror novel of the same name. It ran 135 minutes. The new It Chapter Two covers the second half of the book. It runs almost 170 minutes. This ain't It Chapter Two, this is It Chapters Two Through One Thousand. It's not just that it's long (or It's long); it feels long in a way other recent long movies like Avengers: Endgame or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood did not. It's bloated with exposition, and because the film constantly pauses for flashbacks, nightmares, and even a drug-induced hallucination or two, the narrative never builds any appreciable momentum. Some of this is a function of King's novel; its dense structure, monumental page count, and its sprawling cast - and yet much of the same creative team managed to condense that same writing down to a manageable and economical length the first time around. During It Chapter Two, that task eluded them. The TV miniseries version of It might have moved more swiftly, and that was a four-hour movie spread across two nights of broadcast TV. In the first It, a group of teenagers discover an ancient evil entity feasting off children in their hometown of Derry, Maine. They manage to wound the monster they call ""It"" and send it back into hibernation, then swear a blood oath to return to Derry if It ever wakes back up. 27 years later, It (and his harlequin alter ego Pennywise, played by the preposterously creepy Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd) awakens, and begins its slaughter anew. The only one of the so-called ""Losers Club"" who remained in Derry, Mike (Isaiah Mustafa), realizes what a new rash of child murders (and at least one hate crime, depicted on screen in surprising and upsetting detail) means. He summons the other Losers to come back home: Bill (James McAvoy), now a successful novelist and screenwriter, Beverly (Jessica Chastain), a fashion designer trapped in an abusive marriage, Richie (Bill Hader), a stand-up comic, Eddie (James Ransone) a hypochondriac who works in risk assessment, and Ben (Jay Ryan), a former chubby kid turned extremely handsome slab of man-meat who works as an architect or something. The standout among the grownup Losers is Hader, who has the benefit of playing the one character in the story who gets to acknowledge the madness of Pennywise and his apparently limitless powers - i.e. doing a lot of running and screaming and cursing in pure terror. Some Stephen King fans have speculated about the sexuality of Richie and Eddie in the It novel, and director Andy Muschietti and screenwriter Gary Dauberman bring that tension to the forefront, with Hader playing scenes that reveal Richie as a closeted gay man whose anxieties about his own identity are ruthlessly exploited by Pennywise. As a result, Hader gets both the best comedic lines and the most emotional arc in the film. It's a really strong performance. The other adult Losers are fine, and"
KCM_Doc7_ItChapterTwo,KCM,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two,"It's back. The second half of Stephen King's horror bestseller about the terrifying clown (is there any other kind?) has now been adapted as a separate but frankly laborious film to follow the first one. That was the story of how a bunch of middle-school kids in a small American town in the 1980s banded together to defeat a homicidal harlequin of hell called Pennywise. His relationship to them made him an antichrist version of ET. Now, almost 30 years later, they are all grown up and must return to their home town to face the horrible Pennywise all over again - as adults. Screenwriter Guy Dauberman (who worked on The Conjuring franchise) adapts the second half of King's novel and the director once again is Andy Muschietti. There is some lively stuff here, including a few sensational cameos and interesting ideas about confronting one's personal demons, about homophobia, abuse and depression. It is also about the ubiquitous availability of the past in the digital age and the permanent reunion-stalkerthon of social media, and about the way guilt and shame are built into what we choose to remember and forget about our teenage years. But, like the first film, it becomes a virtual non-narrative anthology of standard jump-scares that could be reshuffled and shown in any order. The second time around, your tolerance for this is tested to destruction and beyond because, unlike the first movie, it is just so pointlessly long: approaching three hours, with our heroes finally beginning to assume a glassy-eyed solemnity like Hogwarts graduates or the Fellowship of the Ring. Muschietti is even hinting at a possible third chapter. The way they battle Pennywise as grownups is not much different from the way they did it as kids (although, arguably, these new confrontations are unlocking painful childhood memories) and Chapter Two seems to consist of an indefinite number of big, scary set pieces, featuring interchangeable snaggle-toothed creatures, or occasionally gigantic, fairground-sized monsters lurching grotesquely up out of nowhere. The scenes deliver reasonably efficient scares, but with the tension level repeatedly and disconcertingly reset afterwards to zero: the scenes don't develop or accumulate anything within a story arc and it feels as if the movie is jumping the shark and jumping back again, increasingly spending more and more time the wrong side of the shark and finally staying there. The situation is that Pennywise (played again by Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd) mysteriously returns to the little town of Derry, Maine, metaphysically reconfigured or reincarnated, perhaps, by an ugly display of homophobic abuse - an interesting acting cameo here for the Canadian director Xavier Dolan. Mike (played now by Isaiah Mustafa) is the only one of the gang to have stayed behind in Derry, and he gets in touch with everyone. Smart, flame-haired Bev is now a well-off professional played by Jessica Chastain, with troubles in her private life that chillingly mirror what she endured as a child; nerdy bespectacled Richie (Bill Hader) is a wisecracking standup comic; Ben (Jay"
KCM_Doc8_ItChapterTwo,KCM,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two,"About an hour into It Chapter Two, the now-grown-up Losers Club walks through the woods to their old hideout. Bill (James McAvoy) trips on a branch and, as if the two have rehearsed this song and dance before, falls into Beverly's (Jessica Chastain) arms. ""You're exactly the same,"" she says to him 27 years after Pennywise the clown (Bill SkargsÃ¥rd) first tormented the group. Bill grimaces and a stutter builds in his throat. Then she turns back: ""That's a good thing."" But is it? In the first It, each of the kids were little more than an archetype. Whether that's due to Andy Muschietti's direction or the script from Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga, and Gary Dauberman is beside the point now; these characters are, for better or for worse, the foundation of what's become a pair of films. The first installment was myopic, but it was generally consistent in tone with cinematography from Chung Chung-hoon that imbued a glossy menace. It wasn't particularly scary, but that wasn't too big of an issue when placed next to how shallowly it realized the ideas of Stephen King's novel. Muschietti and Dauberman return to their respective roles, and their approach is that bigger is better-that fan service equals good writing. As a result, not much as changed. Now Bill is a successful writer, still the everyman. Bev, now instead of being sexually and physically abused by her father is... well, sexually and physically abused by her husband. Richie (Bill Hader) is a comedian instead of just a punch line dispenser, Eddie (James Ransone) is still a smartass, and as for Ben (Jay Ryan)? Well, now he's skinny and awkward instead of chubby and awkward. Mike (Isaiah Mustafa), meanwhile, is the only one to have stayed in Derry, Maine. Make no mistake, though: this isn't just the starting point. There's little growth here and a curious lack of stakes. For a movie about standing up to fatalism, Chapter Two wallows in it. The setup-that all six return home to vanquish evil for good-has cinematic potential, but most of it turns out pretty glib. Look no further than the opening in which a young gay couple (Xavier Dolan and Taylor Fray) fall victim to a hate crime. One of them gets beaten nearly to death and tossed into the river while the other cries in horror. But as it so happens, this scene has no place in the larger narrative: it, like the nastiest moments in Chapter Two, is just a harbinger for Pennywise, a villain without enough screentime to make an impression. As his return first catches our eye, it also catches Mike's, who summons the remaining Losers back to Derry to stop It once and for all. In theory, this means each character confronting their fears. In actuality, it means an episodic structure in which each character wanders around town. They revisit their own homes, going in even if nothing good could come of it. They bypass old shops and street corners, and"
KCM_Doc9_ItChapterTwo,KCM,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two,"When I wrote my review of It: Chapter One two years back, I left it on a bit of a ""to be continued,"" the same as the film itself. As I said back then, my view of part one was going to end up being largely contingent on how well or how badly part two managed to stick the landing. Well, here we are, ready to discuss the conclusion of the clown-eats-kids scare factory, and I guess my collective response is...could've been worse, could've been better. Again directed by Andy Muschietti (this time with script by Gary Dauberman), It: Chapter Two wraps up the Stephen King novel by bringing the story into the present day, with our grown up band of Losers drummed back into service when Mike (Isaiah Mustafa), the only one of the gang to stay in the sleepy burg of Derry, Maine, notifies them that gruesome killings have begun once again, signaling the return of demonic clown Pennywise (Bill Skarsgaard). They took an oath, you may recall, that should the need arise they'd again do what needed to be done. But that was a long time ago, and now each of them have their own lives and only faint memories of their experience three decades ago. And thus we get the extended catch-up sequence letting us know how the former Losers are now winning (or not). Bill (James McAvoy) is a successful screenwriter. Stan (Andy Bean) is happily married while Bev (Jessica Chastain) is trapped in an abusive marriage. Meanwhile, Eddie (James Ransone) is an insurance adjuster. Richie (Bill Hader) is a successful comic, and Ben (Jay Ryan) is now a hugely successful architect (and thin and handsome, to boot). So, life has moved on for the gang, but they're nonetheless compelled to return to Derry to clean up unfinished business. And at a plus-sized runtime of three-plus hours, there's clearly a lot of business that requires doing. Now, normally you'd think that would be long enough to give the story breathing room that had been denied it in the previous It adaptation, the 1990 miniseries (which clocked three hours for the entire story). However, it feels at times both too laborious and too abrupt. It's not so much the runtime but what they do with it, spending far too much time on some sequences and giving precious little attention to others. Now, some of this can be chalked up to the difficulties that arise when adapting from page to screen, and some of it can be attributed to King's prose proving famously unable to stick the landing (something the film itself winks at a few times). Now, the stuff that works works very well. The casting, for one, is absolutely spot-on. Every single one of the adult Losers is entirely believable as the decades-later incarnation of their childhood counterpart. Hader in particular is a rock star here. While he's been impressive in dramatic roles for awhile now, he brings something extra to grown-up Richie that makes"
KCM_Doc10_ItChapterTwo,KCM,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two,"With It Chapter Two we have a needed, yet pretty bad, conclusion to a saga started with a previous, far superior film. If you saw and liked the first movie, you have to watch this one to get the full story. You'll also witness a decline in quality. In a strange way, I'm happy it exists, because it does have some good scares and Bill Hader rocks the house as a grown-up Finn Wolfhard. It closes out the Stephen King story in, admittedly, much better fashion than that spider sequence in that TV miniseries. If you look at It as one long movie consisting of two chapters, the overall ""two-movie"" experience is still cool. If you look at this sequel as a standalone, well, it's a bit of a mess. Actually, it's a big mess-an editing room fatality. The first movie focused on the Losers Club as children, concluding with them seemingly defeating Pennywise the Clown (an always frightening Bill Skarsgard). This one picks up 27 years later, welcoming the likes of Hader (Ritchie), Jessica Chastain (Beverly) and James McAvoy (Bill) to the proceedings. When evil seems to revisit their hometown, the adult Losers return for a rematch with the morphing clown. That's it for the plot. The adults split up, suffer some individual horrors at the hands of Pennywise, then wind up back together for the finale. A big, central problem in this movie is that the kids from the first film, who actually play a large part in this one, have grown mightily since the first chapter wrapped. While there have been some nice advancements in digital de-aging, this film is not a boasting component of that movement. The kid scenes are a mixture of newly filmed scenes and flashbacks. The kids, often filmed in the dark, look very odd with their digitally altered, disproportionate faces and, in some cases, their digitally de-aged voices make them sound like chipmunks. Too bad the producers didn't have great faith going into the It franchise, because they should've filmed the extra kid scenes during the original movie's production, saved themselves some dough on special effects, and had a better-looking movie. There's a lot of whining out there about this film's running time, as it clocks in at 2 hours 48 minutes. I'd like to submit the notion that director Andy Muschietti should've taken three films to tell this story because at nearly three hours, this movie actually comes off as oddly rushed and haphazard. There should've been a Chapter Three. There's talk that the original cut for Chapter Two was four hours long. Perhaps an hour will be restored for a home video release, which might fill in some gaps and make the experience feel more complete and less compressed. Hader rules this movie as Ritchie in the same way Wolfhard ruled the original. He's funny, he's aces at looking scared, and he can handle the heavy drama. Surprisingly, McAvoy seems a little lost in the role of grown-up Bill, while"
AJN_Doc1_TheToxicAvenger,AJN,Horror,Positive,The Toxic Avenger,"French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu published Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste in 1979, one of the first major studies on taste as a social construction. He argued that good taste was ""asserted purely negatively, by the refusal of other tastes."" After one scrapes away the abject horror and disgust experienced in a visceral or ideologically negative reaction, the remainder must be the product of good taste. But only the offended tastebuds of a distinct, mostly bourgeois group implant the good taste canon, according to Bourdieu, and thus, these so-called elites draw the acceptable boundaries of mainstream culture. Cult films rally against good taste, defying the sociopolitical, economic, and cultural elitism of tastemakers. Such bad taste fare transgresses the conventional consciousness and dominant ideology. And there once was a time, established in the 1920s with the emergence of Classical Hollywood and lasting through the early 1960s, when a prevailing cultural outlook permeated the cinema. From the 1960s until the dawn of the Digital Age, cult films could still be transgressive in the face of a perceived uniformity in American culture. But as the overall culture continues to fragment and cults progress into subcultures, which in turn become entirely independent of one another, cult film has transformed into a commercially proven and exploitable market for cult-style entertainment today. As a result of this transformation, The Toxic Avenger, released in 1984 by Troma Entertainment, seems almost cute today. Bringing up French sociology and the fragmentation of cultural values in relation to The Toxic Avenger is not meant to suggest any feeling of loss or regret over the near eradication of the elitism of good taste in contemporary times. In an effort to preserve itself, the social hierarchy of good taste throughout history has suppressed countless artists from expressing themselves openly, forcing them into cult modes of exhibition. Rather, my initial remarks are meant to deplore the normalization and commercialization of transgressiveness in cinema. Antiauthoritarian cultists have become so commonplace that they have transformed into subcultures able to inhabit entirely different spaces without overlap, whether they exist online or in the real world. Their autonomy dissolves the oppositional relationship of good and bad taste, which has both positive and negative effects. On the positive end, it grants the creators of transgressive art a wider audience that supports it both financially, in terms of establishing a reliable marketplace for their works, and existentially, in that their audience has been demarcated by midnight madness screenings, web forums, and countless other subcultural sites. On the negative end, the institutionalization of cult films in pop-culture has robbed them of their potency, rebellion, and essential alternativeness-cult films have become just another option on the search bar. In a way, my belief in the death of truly transgressive cult cinema began with The Toxic Avenger, as evidenced in the movie's modest franchise success.

AJN_Doc2_TheToxicAvenger,AJN,Horror,Positive,The Toxic Avenger,"1984's ""The Toxic Avenger"" is the movie that put Troma Entertainment on the map. Previously employed as a distribution machine for titillation comedies, Troma hit pay dirt when they switched their focus to silly splatter efforts and horror pictures, finding a rabid audience who couldn't get enough of their specialized brand of winky mayhem. ""The Toxic Avenger"" is the prototype for subsequent Troma endeavors, mixing a bewildering cocktail of one-liners and ultraviolence in a production that actually desires to make audiences laugh, even while it kills a kid and a dog, and points a shotgun at a baby. Still, the earnestness of the feature is amazing, always working to find a note of absurdity to molest as directors Michael Herz and Lloyd Kaufman (billed here as ""Samuel Weil"") bathe the screen in blood, nudity, and slapstick, funneled into a superhero spoof with a vague environmental message. 30 years after its initial release and ""The Toxic Avenger"" still manages to trigger disgust and a handful of laughs, representing not only a key Troma financial victory, but it's quite possibly their finest original work. Melvin (Mark Torgl) is a hopeless weakling working as a janitor at the Tromaville Health Club, where he mops floors and is subjected to constant bullying from its customers, including Bozo (Gary Schneider) and Slug (Robert Prichard), and their girlfriends, Julie (Cindy Manion) and Wanda (Jennifer Babtist). When a prank goes horribly wrong, Melvin jumps into a barrel of toxic waste, with the resulting mutation turning him into a powerful monster with strong moral values. Out to help the fine folks in Tromaville, the Toxic Avenger (Mitch Cohen) is transformed into a hero, a development that irritates Mayor Belgoody (Pat Ryan Jr.), whose corrupt ways are threatened by this new arrival. As Toxie takes a blind girlfriend in Sara (Andree Maranda), the melted savior is marked for death by Mayor Belgoody, threatening the future safety of the beleaguered community. ""The Toxic Avenger"" has a weird joyfulness that's infectious, even while it stages ghastly deaths and dismemberments. Kaufman and Herz construct a rather effective silent comedy in the midst of all the brutality, with the picture playing just as effectively with the sound shut off. With a cast that wildly gesticulates with every line reading, broad physical comedy, and a hulking, deformed hero, it's fairly easy to follow the feature without hearing it, as it periodically reaches Vaudeville-style shenanigans. It's not a tasteful endeavor (maybe babies should be spared the magic of moviemaking), but it has a defined spirit that carries the adventure from beginning to end, stopping occasionally to assess character motivations and explore the romance between Toxie and Sara. Horrible, and I mean horrible stuff happens in ""The Toxic Avenger,"" but rarely does the effort sit around and wallow in ugliness, always on to the next bit of awful it can manipulate into horror and comedy. Herz and Kaufman serve up quite a buffet of incidents in the feature, challenging screenwriter Joe Ritter to piece together a"
AJN_Doc3_TheToxicAvenger,AJN,Horror,Positive,The Toxic Avenger,"In the world of movies, many know of the main genres that cover all kinds of stories. But like anything else, there's always sublevels to these groups which can be broken down even further into their own genres. These genres are not the ones people either readily know about, have access to or is spoken of. An example of this are films produced from ""The Asylum"". Their reputation has become known for either making cheap knock offs or making cheap sequels to popular mainstream blockbusters. There are people who actively invest their time into those films. The same could be said for films made by Lloyd Kaufman under the Troma Entertainment banner. In a way, it's just another acquired taste like the previous company mentioned earlier. And although Kaufman was directing films a decade or so before this movie, it was this that got people's attention. The story written by Kaufman and Joe Ritter in his first credit is about the fictional town of tromaville located on the outskirts of New York. The town is filled with polar opposite citizens; those who have common sense and others who literally do the most absurd things no reasonably sane person would ever do. Among them all is Melvin Junko (Mark Torgl), a loser pool boy at the local health club. He's by no means socially equipped to navigate through such an environment and is easily bullied. One day after a group psychotic adults play a practical joke exposing him to toxic waste, he transforms into The Toxic Avenger (Mitch Cohen) and voiced by Kenneth Kessler. Now having superhero strength, Melvin takes it upon himself to rid the evil in his town of Tromaville. The film was also directed by Kaufman and Michael Herz, who collaborated with Kaufman on a few previous projects. What works in the movie's favor is the tone audiences will experience from the execution. It's a simple plot about a discarded protagonist whose misfortune seen to others, turns out to be the best thing that could have happened to him. While out on his crusade Melvin crosses paths with a blind girl named Sara (Andree Maranda) and soon develops a connection. Its clichÃ© but seeing the protagonist earn the respect from someone is something anyone would want. Does that mean the acting and characters well rounded? Absolutely not. Except for Melvin and Sara, no other character has redeeming qualities or resembles that of any regular human being. The way the actors play them and the way they're written are bizarre caricatures of what someone having no idea how a real person would behave. It's very strange to watch but that's partially the appeal because it is so out there. Of the adults that badger Melvin, Julie (Cindy Manion) and Wanda (Jennifer Babtist) are the women of the group who have the most reprehensible interests. Topping it off though are their partners beating up grannies in the street who are rightfully named Slug (Robert Prichard) and Bozo (Gary Schneider). How"

It kinda was a gradual build for me, I first discovered this franshise from the cartoon show ""Toxic Crusaders"" which I thought was cool and I didn't even know at the time this was loosely inspired/based on the movie ""The Toxic Avenger"". I didn't see this film until I lot latter when I was a teenager about 16 and I'll admit it blew me away it wasn't entirely what I was expecting but that what made it all the better as it was outrageously fun and funny; watching it now as an adult is even more fun and funner than before. It's also one of the films that actually inspired me, yes I'm not kidding in writing and getting into the entertainment business. This film to me really turned things on their head let alone turned up the notch on violence, effects, comidy, and the superhero genere up to 11. The content and wild expressionism in this film wasn't common place at the time, it was defenantly before some of the TV shows ""South Park"", ""The Simpsons"" which are just as nuts, and that's part of what made the film great for me because it wasn't afraid of being what it wanted fun while doing what it wanted. This film was made on a low budget but I felt it was money well spent just showing that you can still make a good fun film despite limitations; as opposed to most big budget film where some tend to disappoint because they forgot one curcial element fun. The music is great it's one of my favorate movie soundtracks I really like the song ""Body Talk"" which is a catchy tune and a fun one to use if you ever want to do aerobics or fitness training. This film of course were in it for the action and comidy and like any well done floor it shines on both. The comidy is great the whole thing plays out like a live action Mad Magazine cartoon, it's rich in both verbal and visual humor. I also feel has a bit of replay value because sometimes watching this again I can pick up on more jokes that might have flied over me. The characters are fun, everyone in Tromaville are kinda live action Mad Magazine characters because not everyone is totally normal there is always something unusal about them or are just crazy. From villain despite unlikeable which is the point their still funny, like Cigarface as well as the two health club bullies Slug and Bozo whom are all true to their names, let alone the fact Bozo has got some real impulse problems as he gets easily stressed and angry over the smallest or stupidest thing, it cracks me up whenever he blows up. And Toxic/Melvin whom is a soild superhero."
AJN_Doc5_TheToxicAvenger,AJN,Horror,Positive,The Toxic Avenger,"When I was a teenager, the only available place to watch trash was on USA's Up All Night which showed their movies cut with just enough on screen to tease and tantalize. A trio of films appeared on USA which caught my attention, the Toxic Avenger series, and I was introduced to Troma. This was their flagship series, and it was rare that you'd find any other item as entertainingly zany, sick, and cheap as these films. Even close to these films were the Class of Nuke 'Em High movies which dealt with high school kids introduced to what toxic waste could do. But, in The Toxic Avenger, a geeky, buck-teethed janitor whose trusty mop was always by his side, ogling the bikini-clad aerobics gals who'd come to the gym he was employed to maintain their impressive bods, is the subject of what toxic waste can do to your anatomy when the skin and body are immersed in such chemicals..it can turn you into a grotesque superhero with amazing physique and martial arts skills, not to mention you can rip arms off and propel men in the air with ease. It all starts when four psychopaths, Slug(Robert Prichard), maniac Bozo(Gary Schneider), and their girlfriends, Wanda(Jennifer Prichard) and Julie(Cindy Manion)who frequent a gym wish to cause ""mop boy"" Melvin Junko(Mark Torgle)as much harm and humiliation as possible just for the hell of it. During their past time, these four enjoy driving over innocent people with Bozo's car, adding up points kind of like in the movie Death Race 2000. We see this when the four single out a kind little kid with a helmet riding his bike as they run him over before crushing his head under their back tire! They take Polaroids, for which gets the girls hot and bothered. Yep, this is not for the squeamish or those who demand films of good taste. Anyway, Julie prompts Melvin to slip on a pink tutu so that she can get all worked up for a little sex, setting the poor kid up for a cruel practical joke, concerning a lamb, with all the customers of the gym laughing their asses off at his expense. Tormented and crazed, Melvin throws himself through a window. What Melvin doesn't expect is to fall into a barrel of toxic waste placed inside a parked truck hauling the stuff to a nearby landfill. The toxic waste in turn transforms Melvin into a ghastly monster with a homing beacon towards evil. Anyone corrupt, gangsters, hoodlums, and crooked city officials, are targets of the Toxic Avenger.

AJN_Doc6_TheToxicAvenger,AJN,Horror,Negative,The Toxic Avenger,"A Toxic Challenge: I can say the most positive thing about The Toxic Avenger is that it knew what it was. Sure, it's a horrible, horrible, incredibly bad film, but at least unlike other top worst movies of all time, this one knew it was meant for B-Movie status. Or at least for some midnight views or drinking games. For someone who has not seen a singe ""Troma"" film ever, until last night, I was pretty shocked on the lengths these directors and writers went. From the extreme homophobia, to vehicular manslaughter while drinking and driving and actually shoving a shot gun into a toddler's face. I'm guessing this (1986) was far before the PC-movement or they simply wanted you to turn your brain off. Sure, you would have to turn off your senses while watching, but as much fun as some of the movie was, it was hard to ignore the blatant disregard for taste/humanity. Yeah, I mentioned some of the movie was fun. It was, only because it was so over-the-top in its bathroom humor and bad special effects/voice-overs. (Man, that Toxic voice-over was hilarious, though I never knew if it was one of the jokes.) I didn't, however, mention the deliberate misuse of transporting toxic waste because it was an obvious set-up and part of the overall camp of the movie. Nerdy, nerd, nerd Melvin's the janitor in charge of the mop at a gym and is getting picked on. Why? Because he's misunderstood? No, because he's such an exaggeratedly bad form of geek that makes Napoleon Dynamite look like the captain of the football team. And he should honestly never be let out of his house for his own safety. At any rate, he sort of works by mopping and goggling the bimbos until a plan is hatched to rid the gym of this eye sore by humiliation that turns into him leaping out of a window into, you guessed it, toxic waste. From there, this Frankenstein's Monster with a brand new voice and body seeks out justice for whatever reason you can think of. But, this is not a Batman vigilante. This one not only has no conscious of murder, he slaughters. I could say this is where the movie gets silly, but that was from frame one. No, this is where is where the movie gets sick and turns more horror. Sure, there are more comedic, intentional or not, moments, but they layered on the gore and violence and some of the oddest characters lifted right from Garbage Pail Kids cards, and no, I'm not talking about mutated characters. These were the humans. I honestly can't recommend this movie to anyone other than the midnight-movie, drinking (or other forms of controlled substance) or lovers of bad movie groups. I will say though this movie is obviously set up as a comedic fun-ride and not to be taken seriously for a second, the underling messages of homophobia and violence against kids still is very disturbing."
AJN_Doc7_TheToxicAvenger,AJN,Horror,Negative,The Toxic Avenger,"Four crazed teenagers speed down the road in their car, wildly bragging about points they've notched up by running down different people in the car. So many points for someone on a bike, so many points for an elderly person, and big points for a small child. ""How many points for a child on a bike?"" asks the driver, excited. Learning this will earn him maximum points, he proceeds to knock the small child off his bike, and he goes flying over the hood. They turn round and see the child move in pain. Horrified that he may lose out on his points, the driver then proceeds to reverse over the child's head, squashing it completely. Two girls get out of the car and take some pictures. This scene, for me, represents the majority of this film. More shocking than it should be, even today, but never taking itself at all too seriously, regardless of the horror on show. Melvin (Mark Torgl) is a skinny, nerdy loser who works in the swimming baths, forever cleaning up with his mop. He is frequently bullied and humiliated by a high school gang who one day play a trick on him, which sees him kissing a goat dressed in a tutu. Horrified, Melvin flees and throws himself through a window, landing on a conveniently positioned (and open-topped) barrel of toxic waste. He begins to burn and rot, and eventually the toxic waste causes him to mutate in a taller, stronger, and ultimately more heroic beast, who wants revenge on his tormentors. Toxie (as he is now called, played by man-mountain Mitch Cohen) starts to clean up the city of Tromaville, which is being run by corrupt mayor Peter Belgoody (Pay Ryan), while at the same time romancing blind girl Sara (Andree Maranda) who he rescues from a rapist in a restaurant. This was Troma's first big hit, and also their first foray into horror, having previously focusing on really crap sex comedies. After this, which after an initial unsuccessful run became a popular cult favourite on the B-movie circuit, they focuses only on horrors. This is the second Troma film I've seen. The other was Killer Nerd. You can probably assume from the title that it is a god-awful excuse for a film, although it is quite amusing in it's filmed-on-video awfulness (starring Harvey Pekar associate Toby Radloff). This, I'm pleased to say, was actually good! It was a hell of a lot more violent than I was expecting, and the special effects are actually pretty impressive in some places. And Toxie proves to be a likable vigilante/superhero, however hideous he may be. Having said that, this is a low-budget Troma, and it's not exactly Citizen Kane. The acting is wooden, and the film is so 80's you can practically reach out and feel the sweatbands and mullets. But it is funny, satisfyingly gory, and, most importantly, fun. Toxie proves to be a more interesting 'superhero' than the majority of others. And the"

But for all this industrial advancement there is a price to pay. Pollution, the unavoidable byproduct of todays society, every year millions of gallons of poisonous wastes, garbage & radioactive chemicals are disposed of in nearby towns such as Tromaville the toxic waste dumping capital of the world. Our story takes place at the Tromaville health club where a young man named Melvin Furd (forget what the IMDb says, it's definitely Furd not Junko) works. Melvin's entire life, in fact entire being was changed by toxic chemical waste...' Melvin (Mark Torgl) is a real loser, nerd & all round wimp. Melvin is a mop boy at the the Tromaville health club & everyone makes fun of him, especially four local thugs named Bozo (Gary Schneider) his girlfriend Julie (Cindy Manion) plus Slug (Robert Prichard) & his girlfriend Wanda (Jennifer Prichard as Jennifer Babtist). One day the four decide to play a cruel practical joke on Melvin & humiliate him in front of as many people as possible. However things go wrong, or right depending on whichever way you look at it I suppose, & Melvin ends up head first in a barrel of hazardous toxic waste.

The script by Joe Ritter is as stupid as you can imagine, this thing makes the Police Academy films (1984 - 94) look like the pinnacle of sophistication! The jokes are really dumb & moronic, furthermore it stretches the boundaries of acceptability & taste.

AJN_Doc9_TheToxicAvenger,AJN,Horror,Negative,The Toxic Avenger,"""The Toxic Avenger,"" lauded by many as a classic entry from Troma Entertainment (which decades later became known as the proving grounds of James Gunn), is part soft-core porn, part Fangoria-baiting gore-porn, and part Z-movie production values with continuity and lighting errors. It's not good by any means, but it's easier to watch than bad movies that are trying to be good movies. I am embarrassed to admit I had a smile on my face by the end. The concept from writers Lloyd Kaufman (who co-directs with Michael Herz) and Joe Ritter is that we'll see criminals in Tromaville, N.J., do horrible things and then enjoy vigilante Toxie (Mitch Cohen physically, Kenneth Kessler vocally and Mark Torgl pre-transformation) doing horrible things to the criminals in retaliation. Objectively speaking, it's truly stunning what happens in this merely R-rated film. The primary villains - based out of Tromaville Fitness, which looks like Ground Zero for the coronavirus - make a game out of using their car as a weapon to murder pedestrians and cyclists. They get bonus points for killing kids and racial minorities. ""The Toxic Avenger"" includes a scene where these people run over a kid on a bike, then when he turns out to be still alive, they go back and make sure to run over his head, squishing it. While this is totally inappropriate for young and sensitive viewers, it's possible to have such a thing on a film that people will rent on a lark at the video store because everyone knows it's one big goof. The actors purposely overact and the gore, albeit gross, is purposely unrealistic. While it's interesting for a half-second to think about a town (or perhaps the gym specifically?) that turns out men and women so lacking in empathy that violent murder is pure entertainment to them, it's obvious a half-second later that ""The Toxic Avenger"" is not making a point of any kind. It's stupid for the sake of comedy. Perhaps the closest modern equivalent would be something like the ""Super Troopers"" movies, but even that doesn't line up. Simply put, they don't make movies like this anymore, and they never will again. ""The Toxic Avenger"" gets its humor (or ""humor,"" if you're not in the spirit) out of not only killing kids, but also killing dogs and poking fun at gay people, blind people, and forced child prostitution. The tone is consistent, but the overall quality and the batting average of the jokes is not. The patched together Toxie performance is barely more interesting than that of Swamp Thing in his two unwatchable 1980s films. Despite performing in garish porn-style scenes, ""Toxic Avenger's"" women are quite good looking. Andree Maranda's Sara is particularly endearing as Toxie's blind girlfriend. The film holds back on its pornographic urges in order to secure an R rating here, which is arguably too bad because it misses out on humorous ways to explain why Sara likes this creature, whose only deformity is his face.

AJN_Doc10_TheToxicAvenger,AJN,Horror,Negative,The Toxic Avenger,"'TOXIC AVENGER' A MUTANT OF A MOVIE. 'The Toxic Avenger'' is a monstrously crude, blatantly tasteless film reminiscent of the now bygone drive-in movies. It's also sterling evidence of why they haven't been missed. Wimpy Melvin (Mark Torgl)--one of the most ludicrous nerd takeoffs yet--is a goofy, dim-witted, unattractive mop boy at the health club in fictitious Tromaville. On the job, he's victimized around the clock by the imaginatively nasty hoodlums who seem to make up this town, punks who get their kicks by beating up old ladies and engaging in hit-and-run auto sprees conducted on innocent children. Eventually, their shenanigans result in Melvin's being tossed into a sizzling green vat of toxic waste. That transforms him into a hideously ugly, hulklike superman who spends the rest of the movie saving innocents and avenging himself on the type of bad boys who taunted him for so long. The great taco restaurant scene tells it all. A trio of robbers rush into the eatery, where they shoot a man in the chest and then rape a blind girl after gunning down her seeing-eye dog. Melvin comes to the rescue: He rips the arm off one punk, covers the face of another with an ice cream sundae before grinding the guy's head into a shake machine drill and then shoves the third villain's hands into a sizzling basket of french fry grease. We get to ponder all the bloody, gory, seared-flesh results. Obviously, these independent filmmakers are being deliberately bad themselves. They have what might be called an esthetic vision. There's a lot of satire going on, of superhero movies and goody-goody nuke attitudes and, because the blind girl becomes the Avenger's love interest, of mawkish romance stories between the sweet and the ugly. And, like the cult films they emulate, they're trying to drive us into new septic tanks of tasteless violence. But John Waters and Tobe Hooper in their day at least served to shake us out of middle class complacency. ''The Toxic Avenger'' merely seems to succeed at reaching a new gross-me-out level. The acting and technical ineptness--the dialogue in many scenes is crudely dubbed--keeps the picture from earning even the most rudimentary kind of respect. There isn't, in the end, any point of view conveyed here except a highly amateur one. I've never been big on art having to be moral. Certainly, moral issues are intrinsic components of fiction, but, as Henry James said, the final moral requirement is that a story be interesting. But the sole purpose behind ''The Toxic Avenger'' seems to be to reduce adults to giggling, squealing junior high schoolers again, a form of retentiveness that has nothing to do with remembering cherished cinema. One doesn't have to have moral aspirations or pretentions to want a better way to spend time than that. ''THE TOXIC AVENGER'' NO STARS Mini-review: Whence revenge for the viewer?

DSP_Doc1_Us,DSP,Horror,Negative,Us,"Writer-director Jordan Peele's 2017 Get Out was a brash and intriguing debut, a picture that wrestled with the notion of whether or not America can ever be a post-racial society: Vital and spooky, it refused to hand over easy answers. With the ambitious home-invasion horror chiller Us, Peele goes even deeper into the conflicted territory of class and race and privilege; he also ponders the traits that make us most human. But this time, he s got so many ideas he can barely corral them, let alone connect them. He overthinks himself into a corner, and we re stuck there with him. Lupita Nyong o stars as Adelaide, who has overcome a traumatic childhood experience and now has a family of her own, including husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and two kids: graceful, well-adjusted Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and the slightly more awkward Jason (Evan Alex), who wears a wolfman mask pushed up on his head as a kind of security blanket. We meet the comfortably middle-class Wilson family as they re heading off on vacation to Santa Cruz, the site of Adelaide s childhood ordeal. On their first night away, they look out and see a family of four, mute and stony echoes of themselves, standing in the driveway. From there, Peele unspools a story of  shadow  people, long forced to live underground but now streaming to the Earth s surface to claim, violently, what they feel is rightfully theirs. The effectiveness of Us may depend on how little you know about it going in, so the spoiler-averse may wish to stop reading here. But it s impossible to address any of the movie s larger ideas without giving away key plot points: Before long, that shadow family has infiltrated the house, and now that we can get a good look, we see that each of them is a not-quite-right replica of a Wilson, dressed in a red jumpsuit and wielding a pair of menacing-looking shears. At one point a terrified Adelaide asks the other mother, a twin of herself but with vacant, crazy eyes and a demented smile,  What are you people?   We are Americans,  the lookalike responds, in a whispery growl. That s a bright, neon-lit Author s Message if ever there was one, though the idea of using a group of sunlight-deprived semi-zombies as a metaphorical element in a parable about class complacency isn t necessarily a bad one. Are you and your family doing great? Do you live in a nice place, drive an expensive car, and have plenty of food for everyone to eat? Be grateful for it. But be aware that there are others who, through no fault of their own, don t live at the same comfort level or are, in fact, barely surviving. (The Wilsons also have close friends, Josh and Kitty, played by Tim Heidecker and Elisabeth Moss, who have more money and nicer stuff than they do, a source of irritation for Gabe in"
DSP_Doc2_Us,DSP,Horror,Negative,Us,"It s not ordinary. But certainly not extraordinary. Jordan Peele s follow-up to the box-office-smash Get Out doesn t expand the boundaries of the horror genre like its predecessor or A Quiet Place did. It s almost a retreat into norms that bring to mind humorous horror flicks like Scary Movie, zombie thrillers akin to Dawn of the Dead and over-produced shockers like The Shining. Remember the small, indie feel of Get Out? It s gone. Vanished like a ghost.  The Wilsons, an upper-middle-class family in Northern California, have just settled into their lakeside vacation home. They have arrived, physically and symbolically. Thirtysomething-year-old dad, Gabe (Winston Duke, Black Panther), his tween daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and young son Jason (Evan Alex) all want to go to Santa Cruz Beach. It s got sand, sea, a boardwalk and an amusement park. What s not to like?   Mom, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong o, Twelve Years a Slave), is dead set against the visit. The thought brings back debilitating PTSD. Back in 1986, when she was a kid (Madison Curry) her parents (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Anna Diop) brought her to that same amusement park. She wandered off, got lost in an arcade called Vision Quest, and by the time they found her she was traumatized. So distressed, she couldn t speak and the couple sought therapy for her. A trip to Santa Cruz puts Adelaide in a cold sweat. But her family talks her into it and life is never the same afterwards.   For easy-to-please horror genre fans, who don t ask much from creepy movies, there are enough frights and shocks to satiate: Mirror-image intruders (aka The Tethered), scissors stabbing bodies, blunt force trauma, bodies falling off balconies, boating accidents, heads getting whacked with golf clubs  There are an abundance of thrills. The Wilson family is likable, modern, hip, African American and unapologetically class-conscious. The setting of Northern California and especially the beaches of Santa Cruz are quite inviting.   For discerning fans with a more sophisticated palate, Peele s script is using the doppelganger monsters as a metaphor. They represent the people left behind in the shadows, those who don t get a chance at the good life. The eerie folks from the netherworld who look like the protagonists become a weird head game that is an effective device, initially.  Credit Peele for a very creative and three-dimensional premise. The problem with his ambitious blueprint is that some viewers won t understand what he s after.   The dialogue is cool, especially Gabe s funny asides, but none of it is memorable. The main characters are likable, but not all that exceptional. Neither are their close friends the Tyler family, who act like empty-headed millennials. There is an initial shock when the Wilsons meet the family that trespasses on their property. The astonishment of them seeing themselves is icky at first, but that weird feeling subsides. Soon after, the footage drifts"
DSP_Doc3_Us,DSP,Horror,Negative,Us,"Writer-director Jordan Peele s debut feature  Get Out  was one of the most inventive horror movies in years, and so the expectations for his sophomore effort,  Us,  have been running sky-high. It too is a horror film with a light overlay of gallows humor, but it s a more ambitious work than  Get Out.  Despite some extraordinary sequences, it s also a lesser work.  The film opens in 1986 in an amusement park in the oceanside city of Santa Cruz, California. A young girl, Adelaide Wilson (Madeline Curry), wanders off from her parents and enters a seemingly deserted hall of mirrors where she encounters, to traumatizing effect, not only her own reflection but a doppelganger of herself.  Cut to the present day, and Adelaide (Lupita Nyong o) is living what appears to be a comfortably middle-class suburban life with her affable husband, Gabe (Winston Duke), and  two spunky children, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex). When Gabe proposes a summer vacation stayover in Santa Cruz, she balks at the bad memories but reluctantly goes along. Soon enough, bad stuff happens, leading to the film s first true explosion of horror: One night, outside the Wilsons  summer home, a family of red robe-wearing Wilson doppelgangers, clutching razor-sharp scissors, are silently massed in the driveway ready to attack.  As we soon see, the four actors are playing dual roles, themselves and their malevolent doubles. The home invasion is brutal, bloody, and unrelenting. Adelaide s double, who speaks in hoarse, spasmodic, guttural tones, is especially menacing. The murderousness continues as the Wilsons, seeking refuge in the nearby home of vacationing friends, played by Tim Heidecker and Elisabeth Moss, are aghast to discover that they also have been invaded by doppelgangers.  This is one of the few horror movies to feature an African-American family, and, especially given the racial-satirical slant of  Get Out,  we might expect the same slant here. However, Peele is going after bigger allegorical game. But what exactly is the allegory that Peele is pushing? In the 1986 prologue, he makes reference to the Hands Across America benefit event that was intended to raise millions for those who are hungry and homeless. The death-dealing doppelgangers in  Us,  who are soon proliferating everywhere, likewise hold hands. There are several references to a Bible passage in Jeremiah 11:11 with words  I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape.  White rabbits turn up.  Instead of specifically targeting racial animosities, Peele seems to be going after the doubleness of a society in which everyone has their dark side they refuse to acknowledge. Speaking recently to an audience at the South By Southwest film festival, as reported in the Los Angeles Times, he said as much:  On the broader strokes of things, this movie is about this country. And when I decided to write this movie, I was stricken with the fact"
DSP_Doc4_Us,DSP,Horror,Negative,Us,"Writer-director Jordan Peele rose to fame as half of the comedy team Key and Peele and his breakout hit Get Out was as much satire as horror, not least in its clarity of purpose.  While the macabre underpinnings of the meet-the-parents premise took time to emerge, it was plain right away that Peele was making a statement about racism from an African-American perspective, mocking the hypocrisy of white liberals in particular.  Perhaps Peele wound up feeling Get Out was too neat and tidy for its own good   and too easily embraced by the very people he had set out to critique. His follow-up, Us, is similar in its allegorical approach, yet also a change of pace: murkier, harder to digest and less likely to be nominated for multiple Oscars.  Best to pause here if you don't want spoilers. The story follows an ordinary middle-class family   doofus dad Gabe (Winston Duke), high-strung mother Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) plus children Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex)   on holiday to Santa Cruz.  After dark, Gabe and Adelaide spy a second family of four lurking in their driveway, wearing baggy red jumpsuits and standing in a row with hands linked like living paper dolls.  Where these figures came from and why is a mystery, but their immediate, murderous aims are all too clear. The battle is on to survive through the night, with terror multiplying once it's discovered the newcomers are exact physical duplicates of their intended victims.  Dopplegangers, clones and shadow selves have been everywhere in popular culture for the past few years, yet Peele's use of the trope is initially puzzling. More is going on, evidently, than the stock suggestion that each of us has a hidden dark side.  For an unsettling few minutes it's possible to wonder if he's drawing on the worst kind of white supremacist fantasy for his own purposes, forcing the members of this black family to confront  themselves  as they might appear in the imagination of paranoid racists. But that doesn't seem to be it, quite, because Gabe and Adelaide's white friends Kitty and Josh (Elizabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker), who are staying nearby, turn out to have their own, equally vicious doubles.  If Us isn't about race in the clear-cut way that Get Out was, it also isn't not about race   especially since the mythology underlying the action proves to be centered on the concept of  tethering , a metaphor that all but explicitly harks back to the days of slavery.  In truth, Us strikes me as what scholars sometimes call an  incoherent text , at once over-specific and frustratingly vague. Clues are scattered throughout that ask us to look for some deep, hidden meaning   starting with the row of 1980s VHS tapes visible at the start of the film's prologue, from The Goonies to The Man With Two Brains.  Yet"
DSP_Doc5_Us,DSP,Horror,Negative,Us,"Get Out was one of the most talked-about and commonly dissected horror films of the decade and it thrust first-time director Jordan Peele firmly into the spotlight. Now, two years later, Peel has answered the  what s next?  question with Us, an uneven film that calls to mind a common pitfall in the movie industry often referred to as the Sophomore Slump. Despite an intriguing premise and a single great sequence, Us is a muddled affair that goes off the rails the more Peele tries to expand, explore, and explain his basic concept. It s often said that less is more in horror and, had Peele cut out a lion s share of the exposition in Us, it would have made for a more viscerally satisfying experience.  Following a creepy prologue set in a Santa Cruz amusement park circa 1986, Us jumps forward in time to  today.  A family of four   father Gabe (Winston Duke), mother Adelaide (Lupita Nyong o), daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph), and son Jason (Evan Alex)   are about to embark on the annual ritual of a summer vacation at the lake. Most of Us  first half-hour is devoted to establishing how normal the Wilsons are. When they arrive at the lake house, Zora complains that she can t get on-line. Gabe buys a cheap boat. Us gets the family-bonding details right; however, this being a horror film, as night follows day, so unpleasantness trails normalcy.  It begins during a power outage with a creepy quartet standing mutely at the end of the driveway, their intentions as hidden by darkness as their countenances. Adelaide is immediately worried but Gabe is more laid-back in his approach. However, when the strangers don t respond to his friendly challenges, he tells his wife to call the police and returns outside brandishing a bat. That s when the home invasion begins   a terrifically crafted 15-minute sequence in which intercutting shows the fate of each member of the Wilson family as the situation unfolds. There s some exposition included here as well   an explanation of why the invaders resemble the victims. They are the  shadows  and they have come with the intention of untethering themselves from their hosts. That can be accomplished only by using scissors. Peele makes sure we don t miss the haves-and-have-nots message here by hammering it home with little attempt at subtlety.  What are you?  asks the affluent black woman of her downtrodden shadow.  We re Americans,  she responds.  The creepiness factor alone keeps the first half of Us involving. Then things start going bonkers and not in a good way. Although never as whacked out as mother!, Us trends in that direction with some plot twists/developments that don t make sense. Logic be damned, however   this movie has metaphors.

DSP_Doc6_Us,DSP,Horror,Positive,Us,"After seeing Jordan Peele s new horror film, Us, I wondered if the director had created it as a warning to himself to resist the siren comforts of wealth, fame and his own id after the smashing reception he received for last year s Get Out. Forget the voiceless and pay the price, Us seems to be croaking at its audience.  Allow me to explain: Us is about a middle-class black family, the Wilsons, who go on vacation to California only to find themselves at the center of a revenge plot 30 years in the making. The father, Gabe (Winston Duke), is a big, corny teddy bear of a man who is overcome by an almost pathological need to keep up with the family frenemies, the Tylers. The Tylers, who are white, have a nicer car, a bigger boat and a more modern, better-equipped vacation house. Gabe, much to the chagrin of his wife, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong o), wants to go to the beach to hang out with Josh Tyler (Tim Heidecker) and compare boat notes. Adelaide wants to stay home and read instead of making small talk while Kitty Tyler (Elisabeth Moss) sips her mommy juice. It turns out Adelaide s nervousness is about way more than hanging out with a bickering white couple and their bratty twin daughters.  The Wilsons are soon visited by a family that is a twisted mirror of their own: a husband, a wife and two children, all clad in red jumpsuits and tan leather driving gloves on their right hands. Each of them is equipped with sharp brass shears that are useful for stabbing people and cutting the heads off of rabbits.  It turns out everyone, including the Tylers, have these red-clad doppelg ngers, who refer to themselves as  shadows.  The shadows live underground, tethered to the whims of their sun-basking counterparts. They are a permaclass of the unseen, unheard and unacknowledged, and none of them has the ability to speak   except Red, who communicates with a creaking, disturbed hollowness, as if an animal had chewed halfway through her vocal cords. When Adelaide enjoys a Christmas of gifts, merriment and a hearty dinner, her shadow is forced to dine on raw rabbit. When Adelaide gets married, has sex and gives birth to two children, so too does Red. The shadows are crude copies of humans who experience pain, torture, madness and imprisonment from all the things that give their doubles pleasure.  Sick of their fate, the shadows emerge to conduct a massive, blood-soaked untethering. There are harbingers of disaster everywhere in the film that all point to the same Bible verse, Jeremiah 11:11:  Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.   Us is a jagged allegory for the pitfalls of capitalism and the resentment that mounts when"
DSP_Doc7_Us,DSP,Horror,Positive,Us,"Expectations for Peele s follow-up were skewed accordingly. Yet any rumours that his sophomore outing, Us, is  just  a straight-ahead scare-fest seem exaggerated. Although it is foremost a highly entertaining and well-executed horror movie, Us is shot through with its own strain of social criticism. Here the subject is not race, but class, with the film introducing an underworld of voiceless doppelgangers armed with lethal scissors and clad in blood-red onesies that recall, all at once, prison uniforms, working class coveralls and, yes, Delirious-era Murphy.  The film opens on the Santa Cruz boardwalk circa 1986, where a father wins a prize (a baggy Thriller T-shirt, no less   here Peele lucks into his zeitgeistiness) for his young daughter. Ignored by her quarrelling parents, the child ambles into a hall of mirrors, where she meets another a girl, who appears to be her exact double. Cut to 30 years later, and the girl is now a married mother of two played by Lupita Nyong o, back in sunny Santa Cruz for a beach holiday with her own family. In a film abounding with imagery of doubles, mirrors, rhymes and reflections, it should be no surprise that history repeats itself, with Nyong o s young son wandering near the same carnival attraction, and baiting a clan of (almost) exact doubles of his entire family back to their beach house.  From here, Peele develops a genuinely thrilling, heart-in-the-throat-scary horror picture. The archly creepy doubles   called  the Tethered,  after the manner in which they are existentially bound to their above-ground versions, like shadows   are a monster worthy of the Universal logo that precedes the film s opening titles. Peele exhibits a mastery of his camera, of managing suspense, and of teasing (and rewarding) the intimation of violence. He s also an exceptionally talented director of actors. Nyong o s physicality in her dual role as both herself and her Tether is revelatory. (Also excellent: Winston Duke as her husband, whose manner suggests a burlier on-screen surrogate for Peele himself; and Tim Heidecker and Elisabeth Moss as their gaucher, more garishly wealthy friends.)  Nyong o s physicality in her dual role as both herself and her Tether is revelatory.  Peele possesses a distinct talent for handling horror and comedy simultaneously, such that jokes landing in the midst of sustained suspense and wanton violence feel both natural and cathartic. There are multiple scenes in which pitched screams descend into fits of laughter, which feels like as fine a trademark for writer/director/producer Peele as his recurring image of a single tear dripping down a face seized by abject terror.  Strangely, this sophomore effort feels like more of a proverbial  calling card picture  than Get Out. It s as if Peele, rattled by his own hype, is straining to show what he can do as a straight-ahead craftsman, absent all the talk of him being a generational talent with a gift for"
DSP_Doc8_Us,DSP,Horror,Positive,Us,"If Get Out wasn t scary enough for you, then Jordan Peele really wants to freak you out with Us.  Us is much more of a conventional horror movie, designed to make you jump in your seat, hold your breath for too long and stare down at your lap to hide from the terrors on screen.  In other words, it s more sensory experience than think-piece.  If Get Out fills us with an existential dread, Us fills us with just your regular kind of dread. The kind of dread that comes from having a lumbering red jumpsuit-decked version of yourself chase you down with some mighty sharp scissors.  Who needs a Ghostface Killer mask when the face the monster wears is the scariest one of all? Yours.  Simply structured in three acts, Us s cold open begins in the mid-80s. A young Adelaide (Madison Curry) is separated from her feuding parents on the Santa Cruz boardwalk.  Wearing a Michael Jackson  Thriller  T-shirt, Adelaide wanders into a deserted funhouse and becomes trapped in the mirror room when the power goes out.  What she sees in the maze of mirrors haunts her to the point that when as an adult (Lupita Nyong o), Adelaide is still deeply uncomfortable when she and her family   husband Gabe Wilson (Winston Duke), daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and son Jason (Evan Alex)   return to the beach during their summer holidays.  Sitting on the beach with their friends Kitty (Elisabeth Moss) and Josh (Tim Heidecker) and their twins (Cali Sheldon and Noelle Sheldon), Adelaide warns they must leave the beach before dark.  That night, back at their holiday house, a family that looks exactly like them, their malevolent doppelgangers, attacks the Wilsons.  The middle act of Us is the most effective, a classic home invasion slasher horror, except when the enemy is a twisted version of yourself, it cuts, literally, that much closer.  Here, Peele s prodigious skill as a director is on full display. These sequences are taut, tense and breathtakingly good.  Even when you re scared, you can t help but notice Peele s striking visuals   they really are beautiful to look at   whether it s the Wilsons walking in a row at the beach, stalked by their shadows on the sand, or a particularly vexing sequence in the final act that we wouldn t dare give away.  Peele is also a master of tone, balancing the horror with comedy, just like he did in Get Out. That is not an easy thing to master, and no one is doing it better than the former one-half of sketch duo Key & Peele.  Honestly, if you ve never seen Winston Duke on a boat before, you re missing out. Or, Elisabeth Moss with a lip gloss tube.  The four leads are crazy good in their dual roles, especially Nyong o who"
DSP_Doc9_Us,DSP,Horror,Positive,Us,"Jordan Peele defines his Oscar-winning film, Get Out, as a  social thriller,  and the first of five genre films he plans to make, telling Business Insider,  I ve been working on these premises about these different social demons, these innately human monsters that are woven into the fabric of how we think and how we interact, and each one of my movies is going to be about a different one of these social demons.  Exploiting more jump scares, action, and violence than Get Out, Us effectively expands on the previous film both generically and thematically, combining the zombie, apocalypse, and home-invasion subgenres to produce a socially conscious horror film.  Like many of the most enduring horror films, Peele taps into the return of the repressed. Us dares us to contemplate what lies beneath the  Find Yourself  hall of mirrors (literally represented by a beachside carnival attraction), both psychologically and spatially leading down a rabbit hole of possible interpretations. In the depths below the earth, Peele reveals a prison-like laboratory/dormitory, rendering a space that might be a national  sunken place  the hypnotized state that the protagonist of Get Out fears being sent into, in which the black body is paralyzed, expropriated, and stripped of agency while retaining a frightening consciousness of imprisonment. Us signals its intentions, and possibly a key influence, early on. Overhead shots reminiscent of Kubrick s The Shining introduce the Wilson family before the camera drops down to an image of togetherness: that ubiquitous decal of a stick-figure smiley-face nuclear family on their rear windshield. These figures, hand-in-hand, become a potent symbol in the film, representing much more than just the Wilsons.  We first encounter the family cruising through the mountains, blasting old-school rap ( I Got 5 on It ), heading to Santa Cruz for an annual beach vacation. Howard University grad dad Gabe (Winston Duke) whose glasses make him look like director Jordan Peele, and who is much more of a teddy bear here than as the intimidating M Baku in Black Panther is behind the wheel, surrounded by mother Adelaide (Lupita Nyong o), irritable teenager Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph), and slightly weird but sweetly vulnerable son, Jason (Evan Alex). The Wilsons arrive and meet up with friends and boozy neighbors Josh and Kitty Tyler (Tim Heidecker and Elisabeth Moss) and their mean-girl twin teens and, though the Tylers  new boat opens up a friendly economic rivalry, all signs indicate clear sailing ahead. Adelaide, however, has been haunted by a series of foreboding premonitions, which are soon validated. Later that evening, the power fails, and a family of eerie doppelg ngers, clad in red coveralls, suddenly appears at the Wilsons  vacation house.  Us turns out to be filled with doubles and twins, a gothic perennial of the uncanny that Peele taps into. The double has a long history on screen, with classics indebted to the trope s disquieting powers including not only The"
DSP_Doc10_Us,DSP,Horror,Positive,Us,"As a fan of Jordan Peele's comedy work before Get Out made him into a household name as a director, I was very excited see him continue to explore social politics through horror in Us (2019). And Us (2019) is so much more complex and energetic then his last movie that only came out two years ago, that I had to watch this movie two times before giving my complete thoughts.  On the surface Us (2019) paints a very straightforward survival horror premise of a family called the Wilsons forced to fight against homicidal versions of themselves called the Tethered. But Peele doesn't rely on the gimmick of the killer or monster being our copies to hold it together. He merely uses it as an opportunity to go deeper into very questionable and existential ideas about human identity.  A large part of what holds Us together is Lupita Nyong'o dual performances as Adelaide and Red. When we first meet Adelaide she is this paranoid mother worried about her family's safety and is driven to extreme lengths to keep them safe from her Tether copy Red. And with Nyongo playing Red as well, she makes every single uncanny bodily movement and every word from her rasping voice to feel both terrifying the as film's villain but also evoke the harsh reality she comes from. But as the story evolves, Nyong'o brings more dimensions to both her characters that go beyond the final girl and slasher villain in a horror film. Adelaide becomes more assertive and aggressive in her actions and we then see the tragedy that Red has been carrying for decades that acts as fuel for her violent revolution. It's a difficult challenge for someone to bring this much depth to two characters in one movie but Nyongo's deserves as many awards as possible for achieving it.  Now that Peele's gets to play with a larger scope, we see that he gets to have more fun within horror and comedy. While Get Out was a slow burn to the horror's reveal, Us immediately sets it in motion within the first 30 minutes. The sequence of the Tether breaking into the Wilson's home is probably one of the scariest sequences I have seen in recent years. From there the movie never slows down to make you feel like the Wilsons are safe from this threat. But the horror never becomes overwhelming thanks to Peele's expertise in comedy to be used in the right moments. A lot of it comes from how well the humour is written within the characters themselves from Winston Duke's surprisingly hysterical portrayal of an ignorant nerdy dad and husband to the son played in a breakout performance by Alex Jones unintentionally being self-aware of the crazy situation they are in.  While Get Out made it very clear from the start it was about racism, Us plays it more subtly with its social messaging. Using the creepy imaginary of mirroring and contrasting visuals and sequences of repetition (just like last year's The"
NPO_Doc1_DragMeToHell,NPO,Horror Mystery,Positive,Drag me to Hell,"Consider yourself forewarned: Projectile nosebleeds, stapled eyeballs and rivers of green and yellow phlegm flowing forth from unsavory places are just some of the grisly pleasures to be found in Sam Raimi's comedy-horror film ""Drag Me to Hell."" As Raimi's fans know, long before he became a giant Hollywood player with the ""Spider-Man"" movie franchise, he made a name for himself with the ""Evil Dead"" pictures and other assorted B-movie entertainments like ""Army of Darkness."" ""Drag Me to Hell"" is a similarly modest project, and it's all the more enjoyable for it. This is a brash, mischievous little number: Raimi (who co-wrote the script with his brother, Ivan) gives his devilish nature free rein. But although ""Drag Me to Hell"" has its share of violence (the slapstick kind), numerous ""jump"" moments and a great deal of obviously phony gore, unlike so much contemporary horror, it's devoid of sadism and mean-spiritedness. The looseness Raimi allows himself here results in an especially joyous kind of filmmaking, the sort where the filmmaker's delight in scaring us (and making us laugh) becomes part of the movie's fabric.  ""Drag Me to Hell"" opens with a flashback to 1969 Pasadena, in which a desperate Mexican couple bring their cursed child to a medium (played by Adriana Barraza), who fails to prevent the lad from being swallowed into the abyss of hell. She vows that someday, she'll get another crack at the demon-spirit who caused all the trouble. Cut to present-day Southern California, where we meet spunky farm girl-turned-loan officer Christine (Alison Lohman). Eager to move past her modest, pig-princess roots, Christine hopes to be next in line for a promotion at her bank. But her boss (played by the fine character actor David Paymer) indicates that a brown-nosing colleague, an Asian-American who goes by the intentionally incongruous name Stu Rubin (Reggie Lee), is most likely going to get the job. Christine, wide-eyed and with a perpetually quivering lower lip, thinks her chances for advancement will be improved if she acts like a tough businesslady. So when an elderly woman with ratted hair and a milky eye (played by the fabulous Lorna Raver) shows up at the bank, begging for an extension on her mortgage payments, efficient little Christine, after weighing the options for all of 20 seconds, tells her no.  And that, of course, is where all of Christine's problems begin, and where all of those disgusting bodily fluids start flowing freely. Not even Christine's sweet, caring, academic boyfriend (Justin Long) is of much use, though he tries. Raimi keeps making the gags broader and broader, as if to see how much he can get away with. And he gets away with just about everything, although cat lovers, in particular, might be dismayed by one scene. (For those who want to keep every plot detail a surprise, the following constitutes a spoiler, so you might want to stop reading here.) Raimi apparently scoured the earth to find the cutest, stripiest kitten ever, only to give him an ignoble"
NPO_Doc2_DragMeToHell,NPO,Horror Mystery,Positive,Drag me to Hell,"In 1981, Sam Raimi's ""The Evil Dead"" made a breakthrough for cheap-looking schlock. He found the comedy in dismemberment. The horror had a kind of slapstick kick, simultaneously funny and frightening.  Not only did the homemade quality lend the terrifying impression that, on your next trip to the woods, demons would descend, but the movie looked like you could have made it yourself. That's an illusion. A new generation of horror-comedy was born, but Raimi's inventive combination of precision and gnarly panic was hard to duplicate. Raimi made two sequels (among other, straighter Hollywood movies) but would go on to become the more polished, better-funded director behind the Spider-Man franchise. He gave those movies an amiable pop-whiz that honored adolescence instead of pandering to it. But let's face it, the soaring professionalism of ""Spider-Man 2"" is a long way from the winking trash of ""Evil Dead II.""  His jubilant new movie, ""Drag Me to Hell,"" splits the difference between blockbuster and schlock: a horror movie that eventually finds that contagious comic high of Raimi's no-budget youth, but with grown-up money now.  A young California bank loan officer named Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), eager for a promotion, refuses a little old lady's request for an extension on her mortgage payment. The old lady (Lorna Raver) is a nasty crone. Actually, she's something a little more problematic - a Slavic ""gypsy"" with a touch of evil. In any case, she removes her dentures, steals candy, hocks up some radioactive-looking mucus, begs on her knees for the extension, and, as she's being thrown out of the bank (yes, she's that foul) installs a hell-bound curse that Christine spends the movie scrambling to remove.  Christine leaves the bank, happy that she's impressed her nasally boss (David Paymer) and upstaged her chief rival for the job (Reggie Lee). But the old lady is waiting in the back of Christine's car to inflict more foulness. Their tussle is a nimble cartoon dance whose comedy is entirely physical and whose horror is entirely corporeal. The old lady's fanged dentures unwittingly fly out of her mouth, so when she goes in to bite Christine she winds up gumming the girl's chin. That sequence is the tip of a gross iceberg. And as expertly orchestrated as it is, I wasn't convinced ""Drag Me to Hell"" was working by the time that parking lot fight ends. The principle problem is Lohman, a 30-year-old blonde who sounds like a drunk baby. In order for the supernatural effects to impress and for the plot to take off, Lohman is required to stand around and watch them happen to her. Raimi is a good filmmaker, but he can't keep you from asking the age-old horror-thriller question: Why don't these people ever run for their lives - or, at least, run faster?  But eventually the movie lets its star in on the joke, and Lohman's bright, gurgling manner becomes a sharp gameness that makes Christine's attempt to cleanse her soul a lot more fun. The turning point occurs with the words,"
NPO_Doc3_DragMeToHell,NPO,Horror Mystery,Positive,Drag me to Hell,"Sam Raimi and Ivan Raimi must have been blessed at birth by benevolent Gypsies, because the filmmaking brothers (Ivan writes; Sam directs) have had a cosmic stroke of luck with the timing of the release of their brilliantly nasty little horror film Drag Me To Hell (Universal Studios). With the advent of the economic downturn, this bloody tale of bank loans and home foreclosure can be read as an allegory for our times, lending it a soupÃ§on of highbrow cred. But the best reasons for loving this movie are all lowbrow and shamelessly ahistorical: It's gory, consistently scream-inducing, and funny as, well, hell.  Christine (Alison Lohman) is a pert, blond loan officer at a Los Angeles bank. She's bright and ambitious (though, we note in some deftly sketched character details, still insecure about her origins as a chubby farm girl), and she has the perfect boyfriend: a smart, rich college professor who's desperately devoted to her (and played by the endearing Justin Long, who-sorry, Justin-will always be the Mac guy to me). Christine is angling for a promotion at work, but her boss (David Paymer) makes it clear that to get it, she'll have start ""making some tough decisions"" about unpaid loans (read: cutting people off). And her archrival for the position, the unctuous Stu (Reggie Lee) is treating her as if he's already her boss.  Just at that moment, a half-blind old Hungarian woman, Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver), shows up at Christine's desk, first asking, then begging, for a third extension on her mortgage payment. I think you see where this is going: To please her boss, Christine grits her teeth and forces herself to say no to the piteous woman's request. Memo to self in bold font: Never do this. Give the Gypsy lady more time.  Christine ignores that advice, and Mrs. Ganush responds by invoking the ancient curse of the lamia, which, an Indian-American fortuneteller (Dileep Rao) helpfully explains, means that after three days of terrifying visions she will be dragged by a demon down to hell.  The frantic machinations by which Christine seeks to forestall this fate make up most of the film: She reads up on occult spells, pawns all her earthly goods to pay for the services of a medium (Adriana Barraza), and performs acts that she never knew she was capable of (and that this viewer never knew she was capable of laughing at). Raimi's scare tactics can be a bit too dependent on abundantly spewed gross substances. (For example: Is being repeatedly soaked by embalming fluid while trapped under a corpse really that scary? Isn't the scary part the fact that you're lying under a corpse?) But when Raimi stages a good old-fashioned suspense scene-what's that shadow against the curtain? who's coming up the stairs? oh, God, is the doorknob turning?-he has no peer.  Even those things in Drag Me to Hell that read as cheesy-Alison Lohman's glassy-eyed stare or Christopher Young's string-heavy, Psycho-esque score-work perfectly and seem deliberate on Raimi's part. He started off as a"
NPO_Doc4_DragMeToHell,NPO,Horror Mystery,Positive,Drag me to Hell,"Scream queens are hired to stand in for the audience, to absorb dread and give us someone - anyone! - with whom we can sympathize. But even with this said, Alison Lohman, the star of ""Drag Me to Hell,"" looks positively freaked out from Minute One forward, long before darkness falls upon her character's soul. With her face frequently in closeup, Lohman's Christine Brown appears beyond paranoia, embodying dread for a universe that's pitted against her. Her face, which would be cuddly-cute in just about any other film, seems to mask a depression that is rotting her from the inside.  However this performance came to be, Sam Raimi sure gets what he needs in his much anticipated return to the horror-comedy, the genre that incubated this now versatile craftsman. Christine's turmoil notwithstanding, every inch of Raimi's film teems with devious fun, appropriate since this is the filmmaker's break from more ""serious"" - and I'd argue, more forgettable - projects. With brother Ivan as his co-writer, Sam tosses out a delightful batch of tense, hilarious set pieces. The two are giggling behind the proceeds like the Coen brothers scripting fresh off a critical triumph. Raimi's genre list is extensive: Westerns (""Quick and the Dead""), the Crime Film (""Simple Plan""), even the sappy Sports Pic (""For the Love of the Game"") - overall, less cursed than not, thankfully. But don't forget - it all began with a curse.  ""The Evil Dead"" was a starter job - a convenient premise in an audience-ready genre. After all, Raimi swears he was hardly a horror film buff, and had stumbled upon the idea for ""Dead"" when pondering the trees of Birnam approaching Dunsinane in ""Macbeth,"" a work more to his taste. Like ""Night of the Living Dead"" premise, which came about as the most economical one George Romero and crew could think up, Raimi conceived a wandering curse, borne from an ancient text but quite the inhabitant in any young host out for a good time in the woods. Thus, the tale could be free in form and flexible for narrative development. It made for an open experimental grounds for the filmmakers.  In the years since, Raimi proved he could work in tighter narrative forms. The most notable example is ""A Simple Plan,"" a revision of the ""dishonor among thieves"" motif that proves to be one of the most effective crime dramas ever to come to life. The (likely) committee-scripted ""Spiderman"" films show incessant casual narration, through which Raimi works like a masterful architect hired on to scratch out some big, ugly towers. Resistance and rebellion to the studio routine resounds throughout ""Drag Me,"" and as a return to the filmmaker's original witty shocks and gross-outs, how goddamn touching it is.  In the defense of droopy faced Christine, her life is in shambles from the start. Her job as a loan officer at a bank seems at a standstill, since she can't quite convince her boss (that-guy David Paymer) to grant her the assistant manager position. In her personal"

Don't waver, don't bargain; anything short of yes could put you on a fast track to damnation as surely as a broken mirror will bring you seven years of bad luck.  Look at what happens to Christine, a very good egg boiled to perfection by circumstance and a lot of good work by Alison Lohman. One bad decision and suddenly director Sam Raimi throws her under the bus of his terrific new horror film, ""Drag Me to Hell.""  If you've been worried that Raimi's decade spent spinning the ""Spider-Man"" web might have caused him to go soft, well stop. The director who gave us the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy is back with a vengeance that rivals the one-eyed gypsy I warned you about.  With that fire in his belly, Raimi's ""Drag Me to Hell"" does everything we want a horror film to do: It is fearsomely scary, wickedly funny and diabolically gross, three stomach-churning states that argue for taking a pass on the $10 box of popcorn. Which also makes the movie an excellent economic investment in these tough times.  I mention the economy because Raimi has made it an issue at the heart of ""Drag Me to Hell,"" in the spirit of campy cultural commentary that good horror can do so well. The director and his brother Ivan began the script 10 years ago before Peter Parker's many tribulations in Spidey tights sidelined it. If the Raimis really are as prescient as ""Drag Me"" would suggest, I'd like to put in a good word for them to be added to the Obama economic recovery team.  You see, Christine is a lending agent at a bank and ambition has made her desperate for a promotion. The gypsy is old Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver), who just wants a little of the candy on Christine's desk and another extension on her home loan. Sounds reasonable to me. And it did to Christine too until her boss (David Paymer) hints that if she is serious about that promotion.   So good, decent Christine goes against her better judgment and denies Mrs. Ganush's request. Bad choice, Christine. Before she can begin what will be a long string of ""I'm sorrys,"" that become ""How dare yous,"" there's a curse on her head and the nightmare begins. Not too many scenes later you may find yourself wondering if the title was meant to refer to Christine or the rest of us.  Against all the craziness that any decent ghost story conjures up, there has to be the rational voice. In ""Drag Me,"" it comes from the Mac guy, Justin Long, who I'm sure will one day have a role that will turn his Apple ad stint into nothing more than a footnote, but this won't be it.

Let's not confuse Dong with Vinny, however, who would literally cry if the breeze hit him the wrong way. Dong would really only cry when we teased him and we soon found, as little shit kids love to do, the easiest way to push the poor lad to tears.  ""Dong, the gypsies are coming,"" we would chant. ""The gypsies are coming to take to you away."" Even though we had no idea what a gypsy was or why they were purported to steal children, such provocation turned Dong into a blubbering mess. Once he even threw at chair when someone pushed him too hard.  I hope to hell that poor Dong does not see Drag Me to Hell, Sam Raimi's return to the splatter flick genre that made him famous after years making mainstream blockbusters such as Spider-Man. See, Drag Me to Hell features one very pissed off Gypsy woman who, like all Gypsies must do in horror films, curses poor Alison Lohman's Christine after she refuses to grant her an extension on her housing loan.  More a comedy-horror in the vein of Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness rather than a film created to inspire fear in the hearts of intrepid viewers, Drag Me to Hell allows Raimi the opportunity to return to his old tricks of Three Stooges-type body humor and a chance to play with beasties that spew goo and like to scream in distorted voices. See, poor Christine isn't all bad. A momentary lapse of better judgment and the desire to wrest a promotion away from a brown-nosing, shitbag colleague (Reggie Lee) informs her decision to foreclose on the Gypsy's house. Call it the wrong place at the wrong time, but this choice gets Christine a one-way curse to hell when her despondent client sics an angry demon on her ass.  Unfortunately, Lohman does not possess the natural charisma Bruce Campbell brought to the Evil Dead series and her ersatz charm is not enough to carry the picture. Supporting players like boyfriend Clay (Mac-guy Justin Long) and spiritual guru Rham (Dileep Rao) have neither the acting chops nor the script to be anything more than incidental characters. So the entire production rests on the shoulders of Lohman and her battle against an invisible goat-demon named the Lamia.  Raimi will never be a great filmmaker, but Drag Me to Hell is more a series of squirm-inducing scenes than a cohesive film. Sure, there are plenty of gross-out scenes (including a classic battle between Christine and the Gypsy in a moving car), but rather than amount to a film that really chills the bones, Raimi mixes ""gotcha!"" moments with scenes so over the top, there is nothing to do but laugh.  Drag Me to Hell will never be more than a minor work in Raimi's oeuvre, mainly because it's really nothing new for him. After the past decade where Spider-Man made up"
NPO_Doc7_DragMeToHell,NPO,Horror Mystery,Negative,Drag me to Hell,"The title ""Drag Me to Hell"" offers both literal and ironic inklings to those associated with the movie's payoff, including the audience. A young woman aspiring for big professional opportunities at a bank makes a grievous error with a mysterious woman who arrives at her desk pleading for help, resulting in a horrific curse that anchors the crosshairs of torment onto her soul for a resulting 100 minutes of loud and foreboding celluloid. Her house thumps with the thundering sounds of something monstrous, and then a shadowy form tosses her around like a torn rag doll. She is attacked in her office garage. Animals hiss and growl as she walks by. She is assailed by visions of a malevolent being who makes clear his purpose of pulling her into an afterlife of endless torture and suffering. And then the movie demands the panic-stricken victim to sacrifice a kitten in a vain attempt to ward off the evil presence... and in that moment, a deplorable line is crossed.  For the remaining running time, no more is it our concern as to whether she is going to emerge from the experience in tact or unscathed; the real hell eluded to by said title now becomes the movie theater, where moviegoers go from being surprised and thrilled to completely appalled by some contemptible plot decisions. After a certain point, the movie becomes our own cinematic damnation from which there is no escape.  The movie is the brain child of Sam Raimi, who was made famous in this genre early on with the ""Evil Dead"" series, and then departed the trenches of B-movie horror comedy in favor of loftier Hollywood ambitions. The results were eclectic but effective, yielding the marvelous ""A Simple Plan,"" a taut thriller called ""The Gift,"" and the box office triumph of the first three ""Spider Man"" movies. Somehow, after those achievements, Raimi's mind convinced itself that revisiting the past was a wise decision, perhaps strengthened by the noting that more money for a film budget was as his disposal, and the support of a major studio would give him certain freedoms with this approach that were not allotted to him so many years prior. Sometimes, they say, the past is better left there.  The movie stars Alison Lohman as Christine Brown, the would-be heroin of the story, who is basically a collection of insecurities masquerading around under the veneer of opportunistic intentions. She is a financial consultant at a bank, vying for an assistant manager position and doing nearly anything possible to try and impress her indecisive boss, who is also considering a potentially more qualified candidate for the job. Those lofty ambitions are realized when an old and grotesque woman (Lorna Raver) comes to her desk, begging for a third extension on her house's mortgage. Christine feigns sympathy, but denies the claim and leaves her at the mercy of a foreclosure. The old woman begins causing a public scene by getting on her knees, to which Christine calls security for her removal."
NPO_Doc8_DragMeToHell,NPO,Horror Mystery,Negative,Drag me to Hell,"Applauding Sam Raimi for returning to his schlock horror roots is to me like cheering a Big Mac for tasting the same as it always does.  Sure, it's fun that Raimi took a break from counting his Spider-Man loot to bang out a quickie slasher strongly reminiscent of his Evil Dead beginnings.  But couldn't Drag Me to Hell, which Raimi co-wrote with his bro Ivan, have been just a little bit more imaginative? Apart from the evocative title, which is a great nod to '50s drive-in fare, the film is as predictable as a meal beneath the golden arches.  Demonic possession unleashed by strange incantation? Check.  Buckets of gore and various flavours of vomit? Check.  1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88 gratuitously used as prop? Check.  Plot written on back of postcard? Check and double check.  In many ways it's Evil Dead 4, which may explain the critical huzzahs from Cannes to California, with a gender flip for minor variety. This time, the dead-dodging protagonist is a woman, rather than the hapless hero played so memorably and hilariously by Raimi regular Bruce Campbell.  Pity that the woman is Alison Lohman, a woeful actress who seems to have been chosen solely for her resemblance to Spider-Man's Kirsten Dunst (Raimi is one freaky cat).  As much as I enjoy the thought of Lohman being dragged to hell - I hold her responsible for the failure of Atom Egoyan's Where the Truth Lies - she's as exciting to watch as a sack of hammers.  Her character Christine is just too dumb and innocent to warrant the supernatural abuse dealt out to her after she unwittingly runs afoul of a vengeful gypsy crone named Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver).  Eager to prove to her grasping bank boss (David Paymer) that she has the cojones to dodge bad loans, Christine's bad timing has her turning down a mortgage extension for Mrs. Ganush when the old hag comes begging.  For acting like a bureaucrat rather than a saint, Christine's punishment is to spend the next 90 minutes attempting to dodge the curse of the Lamia, a body-snatching entity from hell that holds big-time grudges and won't take ""no"" for an answer. Not even the blood sacrifice suggested by a street-corner swami (Dileep Rao) appeases the grabby ghouls. (Note to cat lovers: be ready to gaze downward into popcorn bag.)  One might argue Christine is already facing perpetual damnation by agreeing to marry her drippy boyfriend Clay (Justin Long), who takes forever to figure things out. Having Lohman and Long co-starring in the same movie is like being banished to the cinema circle of Dante's Inferno.  Part of the problem with Drag Me to Hell is that it's not 1981 anymore, the year The Evil Dead rebooted the horror genre. Special effects have gotten a whole lot less special in the intervening decades. Raimi used to have to use ingenuity to get his lo-fi shocks; now he just has to flip a computer switch.  But my biggest beef with Drag Me to Hell is that it's just not very funny. With the exception of Raimi's"
NPO_Doc9_DragMeToHell,NPO,Horror Mystery,Negative,Drag me to Hell,"Oh no, not another PG-13 horror film! ""But wait,"" you say. ""It's by Sam Raimi."" Perhaps, then, it shouldn't be routinely dismissed as just another tale of demons and ghosts that has been emasculated with the goal of appealing to pimple-faced teenagers who haven't figured out how to sneak into legitimate R-rated features. Raimi, despite having become sidetracked by a certain web-slinging superhero in recent years, has legitimate horror credentials. Not only is his Evil Dead trilogy considered a horror milestone, but he's the only director to have gotten Katie Holmes to doff her top. That alone has to count for something although, had The Gift been rated PG-13, Katie's assets would have remained concealed. So has Raimi achieved the Holy Grail? Has he made a horror film that chills and thrills yet is mild enough to allow admittance to comers of all ages? Sadly, no.  But wait... all is not lost. Although Drag Me to Hell mostly fails as horror, it achieves sporadic success as a comedy. The conundrum lies in locating the line of demarcation between intentional and unintentional humor. With Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness, Raimi demonstrated that he enjoys spiking his blood and gore with satire, wit, and the Three Stooges. Some of that is in evidence here. Unfortunately, there are also times when the direction and acting are so ham-fisted that intended scares provoke chortles instead of gasps. Even if one shifts mindset and looks at Drag Me to Hell as pure satire, its effectiveness is middling. It feels bloated and overlong and the occasional bursts of laughter don't warrant a 100-minute investment of time.  Loan officer Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is vying with a co-worker for the vacant position of assistant manager. She needs the promotion not only to secure her future but to impress the parents of her boyfriend, Clay (Justin Long), who think she's not good enough for their son. The bank manager, Mr. Jacks (David Paymer), delights in playing Christine against her rival and watching the sparks fly. One day, a crone with the improbable name of Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) comes to the bank asking for relief from a mortgage she can't pay. She's behind on her payments and is about to lose her house. Mr. Jacks leaves the resolution of the matter to Christine and she decides to take the hard-line to demonstrate her toughness. Mrs. Ganush does not react well to this. A verbal confrontation leads to a physical alteration which culminates in the old woman leveling a curse at Christine's jacket button. Soon thereafter, Christine begins having disturbing visitations by things that go bump in the night, and she solicits the aid of a mystic (Dileep Rao) to rid her of the curse and its associated devil who, after three days of haunting her, will claim her soul and drag her bodily to hell. Before that, she has a conversation with a talking goat and a life-and-death struggle with a psychotic handkerchief.  If one wants to analyze the"
NPO_Doc10_DragMeToHell,NPO,Horror Mystery,Negative,Drag me to Hell,"""Drag Me to Hell"" finds Sam Raimi returning to his schlocky horror roots, forgoing the polished world of the ""Spider-Man"" franchise for an enthusiastically made, tongue-in-cheek dose of low-budget horror. With a healthy comic sensibility and plenty of boo moments, it confidently evokes the B movies that groomed Mr. Raimi and many of his colleagues.  Still, there's something missing. The freewheeling spirit that infused ""Evil Dead,"" which only comes from an artist working completely from the heart, unfettered by the requirements of business or other peripheral influences, is absent here. In many respects, ""Drag Me to Hell"" feels like the product of an unwieldy amalgamation of the two universes in which Mr. Raimi operates.  On one level, it refuses to take itself seriously, crammed as it is with knowing cheesy scares and sly visual puns. At the same time, Mr. Raimi - who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Ivan - introduces characters worth caring about, features quality special effects and sets the film in a California world so engulfed in postcard pretty interiors and lavish horror visuals that his messier impulses are subsumed. It's rare to complain that a film looks too good, that it seems to have cost too much, but the sharp widescreen visuals make one long for the grainier ""Evil Dead"" style.  Alison Lohman stars as Christine Brown, an impossibly pretty, wholly insecure loan officer desperately seeking some self-respect. She's having a hard time finding it; her boss at work (David Paymer) seems to favor a new employee (Reggie Lee) over her for a promotion, and the mother of her professor boyfriend Clay Dalton (Justin Long) regards her with open contempt. Thus, Christine jumps at the chance to make the sort of tough decision that stands out to one's superiors by denying a loan extension to an elderly woman named Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver). Needless to say, it backfires. Mrs. Ganush places a gypsy curse on her and soon Christine is tormented by terrible visions, with the promise of being dragged to hell in three days' time.  Mrs. Ganush, though suitably deranged, is far too evidently an Eastern European caricature to function as an effective villain. Mr. Raimi opts for rattling pots, creaking doors and the shadowy specter of a supernatural demon stalking Christine to serve as his particular brand of terror. There's never the sort of grimy psychological torment that gets under your skin. The scenes have been staged effectively, and the filmmaker relentlessly hurls his star into the frenzied abyss. Yet there's a certain steadfast repetitiveness to them. They're developed and played out in the same rough style, with the tumultuous activity usually culminating in an apparitional form of Mrs. Ganush lunging at Christine and vomiting something onto her.  Had a compelling everyday narrative, or one that sacrificed all real-world pretensions for sheer absurdum, tied together the special effects-heavy sequences, their cyclical nature could have been easier to forgive. Unfortunately, the Raimis expect the audience to become invested in what is ultimately a rather thin overarching conceit - woman"
TRH_Doc1_Fresh,TRH,Horror,Positive,Fresh,"""Hopefully it will make for a good story"", Noa (Edgar-Jones) tells best friend Mollie (Gibbs), as she psychs herself up for another first date full of awkward small talk, casual misogyny and ick-inducing sartorial choices. It's a required approach in the world of modern dating, where fearing for your safety feels as common as falling in love, and sometimes all you can hope for is an awful experience that makes for an entertaining anecdote. That's certainly what Noa gets when she falls for smooth-talking, self-deprecating, non-social-media-using surgeon Steve (Stan), finding herself - to use Mollie's word - ""dickmatised"" into going on a surprise weekend trip with him after only a couple of dates, and finding out what he really means when he says: ""I don't eat animals"". Fresh is a film of two halves, built around a rug-pull for the ages (and an exceedingly gratifying delayed title sequence). The first act swiftly and effectively establishes Noa and Steve's connection, developed through brilliantly naturalistic chemistry and improvised banter between the two leads. Then, in a bold move reminiscent of Amy Dunne's 'cool girl' monologue reveal in Gone Girl, the film shows its hand, spiralling into more gory, pulpy territory. It walks the line between unimaginable horror and knowing comedy with ease, much of which is achieved through Stan and Edgar-Jones' wholehearted commitment to both the tenderness and theatrics needed to buy in to all aspects of the plot. Stan in particular is having a ball, unleashing the kind of unhinged energy we've seen most recently from him in Pam & Tommy, and Edgar-Jones manages to make Noa's reaction to an extraordinary situation completely believable, giving her enough edge and dimension to evolve the character way beyond a simple scream queen. Mimi Cave's impressive first-time feature direction is also crucial to striking that genre-spanning tone, weaving in operatic, fantastical sequences with blunt cuts and scoreless action; her camera starts out fairly static, but shots swooping overhead and upside-down sneak in as Noa becomes more disoriented. Even before the big reveal, extreme close-ups on gnashing teeth, superbly edited meat montages and the increased volume of gulps and chews evoke a sense of sticky nausea, and the soundtrack's consistent stream of '80s bangers, poppy tunes and more classic instrumentals only enhances the emotional rollercoaster. It's not perfect; a device involving Noa talking through a wall is clunky and unnecessary, Mollie feels underdeveloped and tropey at times, and it could be argued that the change of pace half an hour in is risky, and results in a loss of tension. The script's 'independent woman' moments and dating-related cynicism can be a little on-the-nose as well, as is the allegory around the ownership and objectification of female bodies. But if you don't take that element too seriously, and allow yourself to get swept along in the heightened absurdity of it all, Fresh is an eye-widening, stomach-churning, violent delight. It's as subtle as a sledgehammer, but Fresh's audacious storytelling, full-throated performances and accomplished direction make for a"
TRH_Doc2_Fresh,TRH,Horror,Positive,Fresh,"Frustrated by scrolling dating apps only to end up on lame, tedious dates, Noa takes a chance by giving her number to the awkwardly charming Steve after a produce-section meet-cute at the grocery store. During a subsequent date at a local bar, sassy banter gives way to a chemistry-laden hookup, and a smitten Noa dares to hope that she might have actually found a real connection with the dashing cosmetic surgeon. She accepts Steve's invitation to an impromptu weekend getaway, only to find that her new paramour has been hiding some unusual appetites. From the outset there's an irreverent tone to Fresh that infers the casual callousness that is the dating scene. It's perfectly reflective of how easily dating can be an unhinged hellscape despite the supposed ""safeguards"" of the modern-era. Cave sets the stage with a thirty-seven minute opening that's a eye-twitch inducing reminder of exactly how quickly a date can go from neutral to noxious. She doesn't have to reach far for stories of meet-ups gone awry, from kidnappers and craigslist-killers to hoteps and himbos, the anecdotes abound. Wanting to connect, romantically, with another person pushes people to take all kinds of risks. Even people who otherwise happily self-contained put themselves out there hoping to find love. There's always an inherent danger to making yourself vulnerable; you might end up alone and heartbroken. But for women, dating also carries with it the very real possibility of physical harm. It's downward spiral of harrowing what-ifs and nightmare fuel. Fresh builds a delightfully nuanced commentary out of the vagaries of that particular social paranoia. Girl (Noa) meets boy (Steve). Boy doesn't come off like a creeper. One night of sparks convinces girl to drop her guard. If that sounds like the moment when you realize this woman may just be ignoring those ""he's too good to be true"" red flags and careening towards the land of ""too stupid to live"" then, you've discover the secret sauce that makes the darkly satirical heart of Fresh beat. As a character, Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) feels more like a composite of bad dating moves, misdirected cynicism, and the hard-to-kill hopefulness of singledom. She's narrowly developed. So narrowly that her emotional thinness begins to feel deliberate. She's cynical and defensive; so self-contained getting a bead on what makes her tick practically impossible. There's surface effort given to showing her as not utterly unlovable. She does, after all, have a ride or die bestie. But for the latter half of the story, it's like Noa, as the person, is less important than the inexhaustible supply of women seeking romantic love she represents. Her feelings and thoughts ultimately mattering less than her body and Steve's desire to possess it and her. Steve, however, quickly comes into sharper focus. First as the too-goo-to-be true man Nao drops her guard enough to let get in there and then as turncoat and villain.  The film's lifecycle will be tragically familiar to many, long before the story goes all the"
TRH_Doc3_Fresh,TRH,Horror,Positive,Fresh,"In the new film Fresh (Hulu, March 4) we watch a woman get flung into hell and then attempt to claw her way out. We've seen such narratives countless times before in horror, but recently, the latent subtext has become overt text. Sociopolitical commentary is the main thrust of so much contemporary horror, to often valuable but occasionally grating effect. Fresh, directed by Mimi Cave and written by Lauryn Kahn, tries to strike a balance between urgent messaging and pure, gnarly depravity. It suggests, in a few strained moments, that the film is perhaps a treatise on the perils of modern dating, particularly as experienced by straight and bisexual women who suffer a constant onslaught of bad men-vainglorious pricks, not so subtle misogynists, and sometimes much, much worse. Which is a more than worthy subject for a film-indeed, it has recently been the subject of several, including last year's Oscar-winning Promising Young Woman. But Fresh pushes its argument a bit too bluntly. Its declarative moments feel tacked on, out of some obligation, to what is otherwise a streamlined and thrilling feature that makes plenty of points without the broad gestures. Cave and Kahn stage the film with a dreadful build. We meet Noa (Normal People's Daisy Edgar-Jones) as she goes on a bad date, bemoans how rough it is out there in the singles scene to her best friend Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs), and then, wouldn't you know it, has an out-of-nowhere meet-cute with a handsome doctor, Steve (Sebastian Stan), at a supermarket. They flirt, exchange numbers. He miraculously gets in touch-not so soon that he seems overeager and desperate, but not so late that Noa feels like a second thought. They fall into bed together and plan a sexy-or maybe genuinely romantic-weekend away together. We in the audience know that something is going to go wrong. Cave gently plucks a string of tension and lets it vibrate in the background, her film's dark and moody color palette suggesting hidden menace. The trick of the film is that we really have no idea just how bad it's going to get until, well, we find out in one ruthlessly bleak scene. Steve has a particular taste, it turns out-a horror of all horrors. Fresh has mordant fun with the awfulness of its premise. Cave turns once quotidian activities into garish nightmares, a soundtrack of '80s rock-pop blaring away as Noa, harrowed but not defeated, tries to figure a way out. The filmmaking here is sleek and assured, auguring good things for first-time director Cave. Fresh premiered at Sundance-where sometimes a little polish is a nice diversion from all the mannered grit-but probably would have broken out bigger at the upcoming South by Southwest film festival, where this kind of bloody, arch slickness tends to play well. This is not an art-horror film in the vein of recent Sundance premiere Master (also out this month), or past Sundances' Hereditary and The Witch. Fresh is instead a grim slice of visceral entertainment, occasionally"
TRH_Doc4_Fresh,TRH,Horror,Positive,Fresh,"Who hasn't been on a first date so boring, you're tempted to rip off your own limb just to feel something? Mimi Cave's Fresh, a high-concept horror film that premiered at Sundance's Midnight section this year, understands the pain of the modern single, blindly swiping right. The film opens with a depressing first date between Noa (the formidable Daisy Edgar-Jones from Normal People, here in curtain bangs and an American accent) and a scarf-wearing jerk played by Jane the Virgin's Brett Dier. He's the kind of winner who insults Noa's outfit, steals her leftovers and then insists on splitting the check. All Noa wants is love, but all she receives are penis pics and humiliations, which is why a meet-cute with a handsome doctor in the produce section of her local grocery store feels like a gift from god. Opening by asking Noa to try an heirloom grape that tastes like cotton candy, Steve (Sebastian Stan) has all the right moves. He's a rarity in the dating world: a charming, self-aware adult who doesn't seem like a serial killer. Cave's stylish horror-slash-rom-com rejoices in the blossoming of a cutesy hipster romance as Steve and Noa drink Manhattans in a trendy dive bar, dance to Dev Hynes and sleep together on their first date. She's on cloud nine as she texts her best friend Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs) a picture of Steve's sleeping face beside her, exclaiming: ""I didn't think people met each other in real life any more!"" When Steve asks Noa to go away with him for the weekend, Mollie, who is queer, Black and therefore relegated to supporting-character status before taking action in the second act, aptly jokes that her BFF is living every straight girl's fantasy. Which is when Fresh veers into something so sick and unforgettable, you'll take that hateful man in a scarf any day. Without spoiling the shocking twist that makes this feminist revenge thriller worth viewing, one man's beautiful dark twisted fantasy becomes Noa's waking nightmare. The process of falling in love can often be a series of false projections - I've never seen a movie that makes a woman pay for it with her own blood. Credit must be paid to the female writer and director behind Fresh, which features a blisteringly subversive script and some of the most assured directing I've ever seen in the horror space. Setting an uneasy tone early, Cave uses micro close-ups of her actors' faces to create a distorted view of romance. With Vancouver standing in for somewhere trendy in the Pacific Northwest (there's a visible Shoppers Drug Mart), the movie's dimly lit bars and cozy apartments feel true to life, with Steve's stately vacation home a master-class in production design. First trained as a choreographer and then a music-video director for bands such as Tune-Yards, and Danny Brown, Cave understands how to sensorially move the camera in response to bodies in motion, whether Noa is making out with abandon or running for her life.

TRH_Doc5_Fresh,TRH,Horror,Positive,Fresh,"In June of 1978, Hustler made light of criticisms from second-wave feminists that the magazine reduced women to little more than parts by collaging a pair of female legs into a meat grinder. The new horror satire Fresh flips that script. Writer Lauryn Kahn and director Mimi Cave take a bleak view of dating in the age of apps, skewering the sexual and emotional entitlement of straight men with a bluntness akin to that of Larry Flynt and company. Both the movie and the magazine take the idea of sex and dating as a ""meat market"" literally. The difference here is that now it's the meat's turn to tell the tale. Normal People's Daisy Edgar-Jones stars as Noa, a twentysomething living in the Pacific Northwest who's about to give up on dating entirely when she meets doctor Steve (Sebastian Stan) in the produce aisle on a late-night grocery run. Steve is flirtatious and handsome, and against her better judgement, Noa gives this total stranger her phone number. At first, it seems like her gamble has paid off. She's finally met a man who listens and doesn't mind paying for dinner-and in the real world, no less! So Noa ignores the warnings of her best friend, Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs), and agrees to go on a weekend getaway with her new beau. One drugged cocktail later, she wakes up chained to the wall in Steve's tastefully decorated midcentury modern home. Fresh waits a whole 33 minutes to roll its opening credits sequence, right as the movie veers in a completely different direction. The cornball rom-com elements of Steve and Noa's courtship take on an ironic new resonance, rendered sinister by context like a pop song in the trailer for a horror movie. To that end, Stan's performance remains frighteningly consistent; what once read as charming banter now comes across like the shallow affect of a sociopath. As Noa tries to figure out how she's going to get out of the handcuffs and away from this house of horrors, Fresh widens its scope to explore different angles on its core theme. Initially seeming to fill the role of a clichÃ©d ""Black best friend"" character, Mollie rises to co-lead position as she follows her gut and starts searching for Noa. Her journey into the dark heart of the suburbs to find the truth behind the Blue Lives Matter flags adds an immediacy to a film that's otherwise very much playing the long game. And once the full scope of Steve's depravity is revealed, Fresh offers up its most disturbing commentary yet, meditating on how patriarchal relationship dynamics chew women up and spit them back out. No pun intended. The comedy is more hit or miss. Some of the jokes have a dry, sarcastic quality that evolves along with the film. (A running gag about telling women to smile pays off in spectacularly bloody fashion, for example.) But others spoil the mood by tipping too far into silliness. Take Cave pausing the movie every"
TRH_Doc6_Fresh,TRH,Horror,Negative,Fresh,"Modern dating can make a girl feel like a real slab of meat - at least, that's the central thesis of Mimi Cave's debut Fresh, a horror-comedy with its teeth filed down to stubs. ""Hopefully, this'll make for a good story,"" Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) tells her BFF Mollie (Jojo T Gibbs) before she heads off on a date with the most blandly vile man you can imagine: he monologues about acid reflux, tells her she'd look prettier in a dress, spouts some racism at their waiter, and then calls Noa a ""bitch"" when she doesn't want to kiss him. When Noa gets back home, she tries to message another guy. He immediately responds with a dick pic. So who could blame her for ignoring every red flag presented by Steve (Sebastian Stan), who approaches her in a grocery store and jokes about how cotton candy grapes really do taste like cotton candy. Steve seems all too perfect: he loves to dance in the middle of his living room, he doesn't want to rush into sex, and he isn't on social media (which the film treats as immediately suspect, but I would argue is the romantic ideal). Noa complains that dating reduces us all to ""the perfect projection"", but she's just as willing to play into romcom fantasy: she's a ""pancakes out of a bag"" kind of girl, he's a sophisticated cocktail connoisseur. As Mollie points out: ""It's a straight girl's fantasy come true!"" It's a very relatable sort of hypocrisy. And when Steve whisks Noa away for a weekend out in nature, we're meant to read it as passionate and spontaneous - right up to the moment the film's title belatedly drops, around half an hour in, and we find out that he's actually a cannibal. Not a hobbyist cannibal, mind you, but a professional one, carving up women for wealthy clients while keeping them chained in his basement so the meat stays fresh. But Cave's film proves that there's a clear difference between clever metaphors and satisfying ones. The way Steve looks Noa dead in the eyes and says ""I'm taking your ass"" is a very dark but funny joke. And Cave, certainly, leans into the film's tongue-in-cheek quality. Fresh is shot by cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski, known for his work on both Hereditary and Midsommar, and the camera lurches around Steve's mid-century basement dungeon (quite nice if you take it out of context) in queasy disbelief at what's going on. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Steve is carving up body parts - for human meatballs and human prosciutto - while dancing to Peter Cetera's ""Restless Heart"". In another scene, he trudges into Noa's room, whining about how exhausting it is to chop up women all day. Stan has clearly been directed to give us Patrick Bateman with a Hannibal Lecter garnish, and it's effective for what it is. But Bateman - of Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho - always represented a somewhat outsized vision of male narcissism, and Fresh can't"
TRH_Doc7_Fresh,TRH,Horror,Negative,Fresh,"The creepiest moments in Mimi Cave's thriller Fresh are rooted in the familiar. These moments are creepier not in spite of their everyday banality, but because of it. Daisy Edgar-Jones plays a young woman navigating the dystopia that is modern dating. Like any young woman, she has become used to the idea that the onus is on her to stay on guard. Walking alone in a dark alleyway, she keeps her car key in a ready-to-jab position when she thinks she is being followed. A guy on a dating app responds to her comment on his cute cat pic with an unsolicited dick pic. The panic is writ large on her face when she can't get any bars on her phone. If women are terrified of walking home alone at night or losing cell phone reception, it is due to the sinister forces that lurk in the darkness. The forces don't get more sinister than in Cave's debut feature, which stirs up a batch of stew from the leftovers of American Psycho and You and calls it Fresh. Marinating the film is a touch of her own creative sadism. The gristle is its conceit of how women are commodified. As the film marches on, some succumb to the commodification, one joins in, and the rest figure out a way to overcome it - and survive. Online dating isn't working out for Noa (Edgar-Jones). Just when she is about to resign herself to a life of quiet solitude, she runs into handsome plastic surgeon Steve (Sebastian Stan) at the supermarket. They flirt over cotton-candy grapes, he makes some excuse to get her number, they bond over dead parents on the first date, and soon he is whisking her off on a getaway. If there is a red flag, it's that he has no social media presence and can't be found on Google. Noa's best friend Mollie (Jonica T Gibbs) voices some concern, but Noa writes it off as Steve favouring the old-fashioned ways just as much as he does his Old Fashioneds. After a half-an-hour or so is when the opening credits pop up to reveal what we're watching is in fact a horror movie. The romance, like many of the beloved entries of the genre, was to wear down the woman's defences till she gave in. Steve was playing a long con - and not for the first time, as Noa soon realises. A whole network of rich, powerful men (let's call them the patriarchy) depend on him to cater to their very particular appetite. To go into any more detail will only ruin the movie. Despite the swerves, there is little doubt over how the story will pan out, or the ostensible catharsis of its inevitable conclusion. When he calmly reveals Noa of her fate and loses his temper over her reaction, we witness the monster hiding under the placidly gentle facade. The monster is always on stand-by, even when he is singing and dancing to Animotion's ""Obsession."" You"
TRH_Doc8_Fresh,TRH,Horror,Negative,Fresh,"Sebastian Stan plays an entrepreneurial serial killer in Fresh, trolling for solitary women on the dating scene whom he kidnaps and holds captive, keeping them alive for as long as possible, while harvesting their flesh for a network of wealthy cannibals. Even worse, he's the kind of foodie who insists on watching someone consume the dish he cooked for them and informing them of how much the ingredients cost. In the film's best scene, Stan's character, Steve, pushes a plate of pasta topped with a single murderous meatball toward Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones), the film's heroine, while holding forth on his personal journey into starting a monstrous meal-kit service as an instrumental version of ""Exit Music (for a Film)"" plays. It's a facsimile of a bad date, where one party drones on about their interests and the other gets in the occasional question, only Noa is in chains, and before she takes a bite, she feels obliged to ask if the meat is her own. Fresh is the directorial debut of Mimi Cave and was written by Ibiza's Lauryn Kahn (a former assistant of Adam McKay's, who is one of the producers), and it's never as daring as it is in that particular sequence, when Noa plasters on a smile and opens her mouth because playing along is her best chance at getting away. The film, which premiered at Sundance in January, is a horror comedy, though its horror is never gnarly enough and its comedy doesn't have enough teeth (rim shot!). What it does have going for it is a tremendously enjoyable Stan, whose razor-sharp jawline is outlandish enough to read as funny when it needs to, and who plays Steve as a West Coast answer to Patrick Bateman, a well-dressed professional with high-end taste, corny taste in music, and a smile handsome enough to obscure the coldness of his eyes. Steve and Noa have a meet-cute in a supermarket one night, and he's disarmingly fumbling, lacing his self-deprecating flirtations with mentions of the family members he is headed to visit. Noa, worn out from the apps, allows herself to believe that she has actually met someone worthwhile the old-fashioned way. And Steve turns out to be an ideal suitor, at least at first. They share intimacies over cocktails and fall into bed together, but only after he takes a moment to ask if they're going too fast (""I don't think I've ever heard a guy say that before,"" Noa marvels). He's a doctor. He owns a luxuriously appointed modernist house in the hills. He doesn't think it's too soon for them to spend the weekend together - in fact, he plans a getaway for them that turns out to be fateful. If Fresh had more of a satirical edge, it might have lingered in this space a while longer, devoting more time to the weariness that leaves Noa so ready to let her guard down and buy into Steve's suspicious perfection. But despite a title sequence that arrives a"
TRH_Doc9_Fresh,TRH,Horror,Negative,Fresh,"You don't need a master's degree in horror to know how regularly and thoughtlessly movies subject women's bodies to the rule of men. It's refreshing, then, to witness a new wave of bold female-directed horror movies that have effectively flipped the male gaze on its head while conveying the discomfort of violence against women, from Coralie Fargeat's Revenge to Julia Ducournau's Titane to Dasha Nekrasova's The Scary of Sixty-First. Mimi Cave's Fresh aims for a similar kind of genre corrective through a brazenly black comic allegory in which women are viewed as literally nothing more than meat to be consumed, except its tone-deaf cheekiness only results in a feeling of dreary regression. Cave and screenwriter Lauryn Kahn waste no time in comically illustrating the misogynistic hellscape that is the contemporary cisgender dating scene. As Fresh begins, its meek and lonely protagonist Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) is out on a date with a blustery, scarf-wearing bro named Chad (Brett Dier). Truly living up to his name, Chad derogatorily comments on Noa's outfit while launching into a diatribe about how women don't dress sexy enough anymore, before also finding time to throw some racist barbs at the server at the Chinese restaurant where they're eating. Akin to a sketch comedy's take on a bad date, the scene makes valid observations but glosses over the more quietly insidious tactics that men regularly use to domineer women in favor of milking surface-level humor from ordinary douchebaggery. The night comes to an abrupt close when Noa diplomatically tells Chad that they're not a good match and he responds by calling her a stuck-up bitch and walking away. Noa seems ready to resign herself to a life without love, but then along comes plastic surgeon Steve (Sebastian Stan), whom she encounters at the grocery store in a meet-cute that feels too good to be true. He's charming and awkwardly funny (he approaches her by clumsily opining about how cotton candy grapes actually taste like cotton candy), with a boyish sheepishness that instantly disarms her state of despondence. They go on a couple of dates and as Noa begins to fall for him, Steve suggests a spur-of-the-moment getaway to the picturesque woodland region of Cottage Grove. ""It's a straight girl's fantasy,"" Noa's friend Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs) mockingly tells her before Noa throws caution to the wind and accepts the invitation. Dr. Steve is, of course, hiding something-in this case that he's a black-market human flesh trafficker who kidnaps women to sell their meat as a delicacy for exorbitant prices. This reveal comes around Fresh's half-hour mark and shouldn't be too much of a surprise considering Steve's suspiciously anonymous nature (for one, the doctor isn't on social media) and anxious line of questioning during date number two about whether Noa has told anyone about him. Consequently, Noa is drugged and chained up in Steve's basement, alongside a couple of other women who she can only hear through the walls, primed to be gradually dismembered-all while being kept alive"
TRH_Doc10_Fresh,TRH,Horror,Negative,Fresh,"Modern dating can be hell. Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) knows this firsthand as she seems to swipe right on nothing but losers. Then she bumps into the charming Steve (Sebastian Stan) at a grocery store. The adorable meet-cute sets up a recipe for love until Noa discovers Steve harbors unusual appetites that will challenge her survival. Fresh takes a literal approach to the meat market woes of modern dating, though it's more familiar and tonally uneven than its title implies. The title card takes roughly forty minutes to arrive in director Mimi Cave's feature debut, written by Lauryn Kahn. Up until this point, Fresh plays like a charming rom-com that highlights its most significant strength in leads Edgar-Jones and Stan. There's an easy chemistry between the pair, making their characters winsome straightaway. Cave also takes the time to present just how nightmarish it is on the dating scene long before Noa falls into true terror. The affable and seemingly grounded Steve is a rare diamond in the rough compared to previous matches. Once the truth about Steve gets unveiled, Fresh shifts into a promising horror-comedy that puts its lead in the same conversation as the likes of Patrick Bateman. But despite a few key moments that allow Stan to cut loose, pun intended, Cave struggles with tone. The pitch-black humor only occasionally enters the equation, and, despite the delicious premise, the horror gets too restrained. Keeping so much earnest focus on Noa, who in turn keeps her emotions guarded, means that her long game in plotting a way out of her predicament contradicts and undermines many attempts at humor. Emphasis on long; the pacing starts to sag in the second act as a methodical psychological game plays out, and the stakes seem to diminish. Supporting characters defy logic for the sake of the plot, putting themselves in harm's way despite knowing better. It all builds to a messy and familiar finale. Even still, the allegorical messaging still works, even if heavy-handed, and much of that belongs to just how much we root for Noa. Edgar-Jones makes for one endearing protagonist, and her brand of vulnerability offers up an atypical horror heroine that's infectious. She holds her own impressively against Stan's charisma, which somehow creates a sense of cheery optimism despite his character's carnivorous, dastardly red flags. He sells Fresh's intent and messaging, even in its narrative shortcomings. While the tone and story threaten to fall through Cave's grasp, the direction and stylistic flourishes shine. Especially when it comes to food, there's an elegance on display that would make the likes of gourmand Hannibal Lecter nod in approval. The core concept and stellar leads make Fresh a fun enough time, though it overstays its welcome by revisiting its metaphors instead of deepening them. The reluctance to fully embrace its horror and humor lessens its impact. In the end, this charming meat-cute whets your appetite with a delectable first course of allegory, style, and great characters. But it leaves you unsatiated when it"
KST_Doc1_EEAaO,KST,Sci-Fi,Positive,Everything Everywhere All at Once,"The idea of the multiverse has been a conundrum for modern physics and a disaster for modern popular culture. I'm aware that some of you here in this universe will disagree, but more often than not a conceit that promises ingenuity and narrative abundance has delivered aggressive brand extension and the infinite recombination of clichÃ©. Had I but world enough and time, I might work these thoughts up into a thunderous supervillain rant, but instead I'm happy to report that my research has uncovered a rare and precious exception. That would be ""Everything Everywhere All at Once,"" an exuberant swirl of genre anarchy directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert. The filmmakers - who work under the name Daniels and who are best known for the wonderfully unclassifiable ""Swiss Army Man"" (starring Daniel Radcliffe as a flatulent corpse) - are happy to defy the laws of probability, plausibility and coherence. This movie's plot is as full of twists and kinks as the pot of noodles that appears in an early scene. Spoiling it would be impossible. Summarizing it would take forever - literally! But while the hectic action sequences and flights of science-fiction mumbo-jumbo are a big part of the fun (and the marketing), they aren't really the point. This whirligig runs on tenderness and charm. As in ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" or Pixar's ""Inside Out,"" the antic cleverness serves a sincere and generous heart. Yes, the movie is a metaphysical multiverse galaxy-brain head trip, but deep down - and also right on the surface - it's a bittersweet domestic drama, a marital comedy, a story of immigrant striving and a hurt-filled ballad of mother-daughter love. At the center of it all is Evelyn Wang, played by the great Michelle Yeoh with grace, grit and perfect comic timing. Evelyn, who left China as a young woman, runs a laundromat somewhere in America with her husband, Waymond (Ke Huy Quan). Her life is its own small universe of stress and frustration. Evelyn's father (James Hong), who all but disowned her when she married Waymond, is visiting to celebrate his birthday. An I.R.S. audit looms. Waymond is filing for divorce, which he says is the only way he can get his wife's attention. Their daughter, Joy (Stephanie Hsu), has self-esteem issues and also a girlfriend named Becky (Tallie Medel), and Evelyn doesn't know how to deal with Joy's teenage angst or her sexuality. The first stretch of ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" is played in a key of almost-realism. There are hints of the cosmic chaos to come, in the form of ominous musical cues (the score is by Son Lux) and swiveling camera movements (the cinematography is by Larkin Seiple) - but the mundane chaos of Evelyn's existence provides plenty of drama. To put it another way, the Daniels understand that she and her circumstances are already interesting. The key to ""Everything"" is that the proliferating timelines and possibilities, though full of danger and silliness, don't so much represent"
KST_Doc2_EEAaO,KST,Sci-Fi,Positive,Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Few things in life are certain besides death, taxes, and maybe the never-ending task that is doing laundry. At least that's where the characters in writer/directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, collectively known as Daniels, new film ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" find themselves initially. That is, until they take an emotional, philosophical, and deeply weird trip through the looking glass into the multiverse and discover metaphysical wisdom along the way. In this love letter to genre cinema, Michelle Yeoh gives a virtuoso performance as Evelyn Wang, a weary owner of a laundromat under IRS audit. We first meet her enjoying a happy moment with her husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan) and their daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu). We see their smiling faces reflected in a mirror on their living room wall. As the camera literally zooms through the mirror, Evelyn's smile fades, now seated at a table awash with business receipts. She's preparing for a meeting with an auditor while simultaneously trying to cook food for a Chinese New Year party that will live up to the high standards of her visiting father Gong Gong (James Hong, wiley as ever).On top of juggling her father's visit and the tax audit, Evelyn's sullen daughter Joy wants to bring her girlfriend Becky (Tallie Medel) to the party and her husband wants to talk about the state of their marriage. Just as Evelyn begins to feel overwhelmed by everything happening in her life she's visited by another version of Waymond from what he calls the Alpha verse. Here humans have learned to ""verse jump"" and are threatened by an omniverse agent of chaos known as Jobu Tupaki. Soon, Evelyn is thrust into a universe-hopping adventure that has her questioning everything she thought she knew about her life, her failures, and her love for her family. Most of the action is set in an IRS office building in Simi Valley (which, as a Californian, had me in stitches), where Evelyn must battle IRS agent Diedre (Jamie Lee Curtis, having the time of her life), a troop of security guards, and possibly everyone else she's ever met. Production designer Jason Kisvarday crafts a seemingly endless cubicle-filled office where everything from the blade of a paper trimmer to a butt plug shaped auditor of the year awards become fair game in a battle to save the universe. Editor Paul Rogers' breakneck pace matches the script's frenetic dialogue, with layers of universes simultaneously folding into each other while also propelling Evelyn's internal journey. Match cuts seamlessly connect the universes together, while playful cuts help emphasize the humor at the heart of the film. Born from choices both made and not made, each universe has a distinct look and feel, with winking film references ranging from ""The Matrix"" to ""The Fall"" to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" to ""In The Mood For Love"" to ""Ratatouille."" Even Michelle Yeoh's own legacy finds its way into the film with loving callbacks to her Hong Kong action film days and the wuxia"
KST_Doc4_EEAaO,KST,Sci-Fi,Positive,Everything Everywhere All at Once,"The multiverse is having a moment. I'm undecided on whether the decision to chase up Marvel's Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness with Everything Everywhere All at Once - a film grounded in the same concept of parallel realities, yet made with a fraction of the budget - is foolhardy or ingenious. Either way, David has shown Goliath how it's done. While Marvel executives huddle around conference tables, braiding together franchises in a grand show of corporate synergy, here's a film that really understands what the infinite might look like. Everything Everywhere All at Once exists in the outer wilds of the imagination, in the realm of lucid dreaming and liminal spaces. It bounces off familiar representations of altered states, whether it be The Matrix or the phantasmical films of Michel Gondry, while feeling entirely unclassifiable. It's both proudly puerile, with a running joke about butt plugs, and breathlessly sincere about the daily toil of intergenerational trauma. That curious mixture of tonal extremes will already be familiar to fans of Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, otherwise known as The Daniels. Following the success of their music video for DJ Snake and Lil Jon's ""Turn Down for What"" - in which a guy smashes crotch-first through several storeys of an apartment building - they made their debut feature Swiss Army Man (2016) about the tender relationship between the survivor of a shipwreck and a farting corpse played by Daniel Radcliffe. With Everything Everywhere All at Once, these filmmakers have fully hit their stride. At the heart of its story is an ordinary woman, Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh). In fact, she's the most ordinary of women, quietly running a laundromat in the Simi Valley, California, with her sweet, sprightly husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan). Tensions are high. Evelyn's father (James Hong) is visiting from China and has always looked down on her decision to marry Waymond and move to America. Her daughter, Joy (Stephanie Hsu), has brought her girlfriend Becky (Tallie Medel) along, already bitter in the knowledge that her mother is about to shove her back in the closet. Oh, and Evelyn's being audited. ""From a stack of receipts, I can trace the ups and downs of your life,"" her assigned IRS agent Deirdre Beaubeirdra (Jamie Lee Curtis, delightfully and manically mundane) warns. ""And it does not look good."" Then, out of the blue, a version of Waymond from somewhere called the ""Alphaverse"" commandeers her husband's body in order to tell her that she's the key to saving all reality. Out of all the Evelyns that exist, branching off from every choice she's ever made, this Evelyn has fared the worst. That means she's the only one who still has unfulfilled potential. What a beautiful way to look at the world - that a life in stasis is really one of bottomless possibility. We meet quite a few of the other Evelyns: a martial arts star who could easily be Yeoh herself (spot footage of the actor on the Crazy"
KST_Doc8_EEAaO,KST,Sci-Fi,Positive,Everything Everywhere All at Once,"Anyone who considers themselves a fan of film has, at some point, become familiar with a sort of dreary stagnation with their passion for the medium. After so many movies and so many bags of popcorn, you find yourself growing dreadfully numb to an art form that once inspired and thrilled you like no other. For a while, I felt this numbness, and I even thought it might kill my love for film entirely. It wasn't until I saw the wonderfully inventive ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" - the latest from writer-directors Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert - that I rediscovered, through the most emotionally uplifting cinematic experience I've ever had, my profound love for the screen. Through an original and extremely creative story that was expertly directed, acted and scored, ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" becomes something far greater than the sum of its many parts. For me, it became one of my favorite films of all time. ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" tells the story of Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh), an aging Chinese immigrant who co-owns a laundromat with her spritely husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan). At the film's beginning, Evelyn's life is a static, stressful mess characterized by bitter regret and crushing mundanity. Her husband, who loves her dearly but feels like he has no other recourse in the face of her apathy, is seeking a divorce; her daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu), whose sexuality Evelyn has a difficult time coming to terms with, has crippling insecurities that Evelyn is woefully unprepared to deal with. Additionally, her disapproving father Gong-Gong (James Hong), who effectively disowned her for marrying Waymond and is the source of the intergenerational trauma at the heart of the film, is visiting from China. On top of all that, she's also being audited by the IRS. Things go from stressful to surreal when, while dealing with an odious auditor played by Jamie Lee Curtis, a version of Waymond from another reality appears and drags Evelyn into a bizarre adventure in which the fate of the multiverse is at stake and only she can save it. As you might have guessed from the film's name, the film  contains a small universe of moving parts, all of which are done well and deserve praise. All the actors bring their A-game as they play a myriad of alternate versions of themselves in a number of whacky realities,like one where humanity evolved to have hot dogs for fingers that squirt out condiments when aroused. At its core though is Yeoh. She is intrepid and versatile in this film, and I'm grateful she was given the ability to put her acting prowess on full display. Her martial arts skills, her perfect comedic timing and her immaculate ability to convey the full range of human emotion with the most minute actions are a joy to watch as she cycles through being a world-class hibachi chef, a movie star, a blind opera singer, a dominatrix, a rock and everything in between."
KST_Doc10_EEAaO,KST,Sci-Fi,Positive,Everything Everywhere All at Once,"The multiverse has officially invaded our pop culture landscape, and the idea of seeking characters from alternate realities can be found everywhere. Of course, when reality is so frequently bleak, getting a chance to escape it and get a glimpse of a different universe is ever so appealing. Everything Everywhere All at Once finds fresh soil to plant a complex seed in this conceit, a fresh take on the trend that is truly bizarre, gross, heartfelt, and honest. This is a work of art about staring into the abyss, taking stock of the darkness around us, and choosing kindness over despair. It also features Michelle Yeoh in an alternate dimension where people have giant hot dogs for fingers, so there's that too. The opening scene introduces the Wangs as a happy Chinese American family through a mirror, before jumping inside said mirror and revealing a deeply dissatisfied and broken family on the other side. Evelyn (Yeoh) is in an unhappy marriage with a stubbornly guileless husband Waymond (the phenomenal Ke Huy Quan) who frustratingly sees the bright side in every situation and convinced her to move to California and find a better life after her overbearing and intimidating father, Gong Gong (James Hong having the time of his life at just 93 years young), forbid their marriage and disowned her. Unbeknownst to Evelyn, Waymond isn't all that happy either, as he hides divorce papers that he tries to muster the courage to give to his wife. Last but not least, Evelyn's daughter, Joy (Stephanie Hsu), is far from an epitome of her own name, with the lack of acknowledgement from Evelyn towards Joy's girlfriend revealing a deep well of under-discussed frustration. The last straw in a lifetime of being dealt bad hands (when she was born, the doctor apologized to her father for having a baby girl) is that Evelyn's laundromat is being audited by the IRS and the human version of Roz from Monsters, Inc., played by Jamie Lee Curtis in so much makeup and prosthetic work that she could rival Colin Farrell's Penguin. But the audit gets interrupted by an emergency plea for Evelyn to save the entire multiverse from annihilation by tapping into the skills of her more accomplished alternate selves. Why is this Evelyn the one to save them all? Because she is quite literally the least fulfilled, the biggest blank slate of them all; a woman who has failed at every single hobby, dream, and goal she ever attempted. Yeoh gives what could very well be the best performance of her career thus far as a character going through a deep mid-life crisis. Yeoh not only does a terrific job portraying the emptiness of main Evelyn's life, but she makes every one of her alternate selves feel unique yet recognizable in the different choices they made. Everything Everywhere All at Once firmly acknowledges that once you start thinking about those roads not taken, once you take in everything in your life, everywhere you go, all"

In Everything Everywhere All at Once, the duo take every existential question, raunchy joke and nonsensical notion they've seemingly ever had and throw it all at the screen in a chaotic, hectic and utterly exhausting two hours and 12 minutes, an all-consuming sensorial cinematic assault. Whether or not that sounds like a good time at the movies is up to the viewer to decide. The audaciously daring and original filmmaking on display is indeed laudable, as well as the obvious delight poured into the making of this film. However, admiring the chutzpah of The Daniels doesn't necessarily translate into actual enjoyment of the film, which is a high-concept project with plenty of flair, but a crucial lack of finesse in storytelling. It's the script that's the fatal flaw in Everything Everywhere All at Once. Though deeply earnest and heartfelt, with a desire to engage in larger questions of existence and love across time, space and form, it's incredibly messy, unbalanced and unmotivated, and demands a certain measure of goodwill from the viewer that it does not reciprocate. Because the story is such an extreme concept, the script is made up almost entirely of rapid-fire exposition, explanation and monologues; when nothing makes sense a character says, ""that doesn't make sense,"" deployed like some kind of screenwriting ""get out of jail free"" card that doesn't pass muster. Chapter titles as a structuring device are used in a manner that is downright rude, and the film ""ends"" no less than nine times. This is all just to say that describing the premise of Everything Everywhere All at Once is a unique challenge.

Evelyn doesn't have time or attention to dole out to anyone, and her family is struggling. It's at said tax audit that something strange happens: her husband, Waymond (Ke Huy Quan, yes, Data from The Goonies and Short Round from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom) seemingly transforms into a new person, and informs her that she's actually part of a large, extended multiverse. He teaches her how to jump into other parallel lives she's led, like ones where she studied martial arts, perhaps.

KST_Doc5_EEAaO,KST,Sci-Fi,Negative,Everything Everywhere All at Once,"The movie world is awash in fantasy, and that's a problem, because fantasy is the riskiest genre. There's no middle ground with fantasy because there's no ground at all. Even a middling work of realism inevitably rests on experience, observation, and knowledge, but a mediocre fantasy is a transparent emptiness, a contrivance of parts that aren't held together by the atmosphere of social life. It's the triple axel of cinema: when successful, fantasies are glorious, seemingly expanding the very nature of experience by way of speculative imagination. Some of the best movies of recent years-""The Future,"" ""Us,"" and ""The French Dispatch""-are fantasies, and their artistic success is doubled by their very resistance to the corporatization of fantasy in the overproduction and overmanagement of superhero franchises. But a failed fantasy is a wipeout, and that's the simplest and clearest way to describe ""Everything Everywhere All at Once,"" a new film (opening Friday) by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (a duo called Daniels). Were it not for the appealing and charismatic presence of its cast, it would leave nothing but a vapor puff that disperses when the lights go on. The emptiness of ""E.E.A.A.O."" is all the more disheartening inasmuch as its fantasy has a substantial and significant real-world premise, one that gets a flip and generic treatment for the sake of some neat-o special effects. ""E.E.A.A.O."" is the story of a married couple, Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh) and Waymond Wang (Ke Huy Quan), who were born and raised in China and came to the United States as adults. They own a laundromat in the Simi Valley, in California, and have trouble, business and personal. The laundromat is losing money and Evelyn and Waymond are growing distant from each other; she is demanding and peremptory, and he is mild-mannered and whimsical. Her father (James Hong), called only Gong Gong (""maternal grandfather""), is visiting from China, and the couple try to maintain a cheerful front to convince him that they've made a success of life in America. Their daughter, Joy (Stephanie Hsu), is a recent college graduate at loose ends; when her mother introduces Joy's girlfriend, Becky (Tallie Medel), to Gong Gong as her ""good friend""-i.e., she hides from him that Joy is queer-this failure instantly rips the mother-daughter relationship apart. The Wangs' biggest and most pressing problem is taxes: they're being audited by the I.R.S. At their appointment, the auditor, Deirdre (Jamie Lee Curtis), is stern and aggressive; she threatens to seize the Wangs' business and personal assets, giving them until six that evening to reorganize and refile their claims. But Waymond has already given Evelyn a way out: in the elevator, he transforms into someone like himself, who's not exactly himself, and gives Evelyn a set of instructions-on the back of a divorce filing, no less-that will enable her to enter the so-called multiverse, the realm of alternate lives that she could have lived. What's in a name? Sometimes, all one needs to know. The auditor's full name is Deirdre Beaubeirdra"

It's time for me to weigh in on this one as I waited and waited to post thoughts on it. It's also been, more or less, agreed upon that if there is one Best Picture contender to have been released so far this year then it's this one. I don't know if older Academy voters will go for this outrageous movie, but its incredible success at the box-office will definitely push it forward. The film premiered at South by Southwest in March to rapturous praise. It'll probably top our mid-year critics poll next week. It's blowing minds nationwide, but it didn't do anything for me. It just felt messy. Maybe that was the point. I can't say I loved the film, but it's well directed and well-acted, with a special shout out to the film's top-notch tech departments. So, am I missing something here? Clearly. It didn't do a damn thing for me. Yes, the cast is great, the photography nicely chosen, Chinese culture effortlessly represented, etc. But it felt as though the Daniels were just throwing every idea at the screen, and the result felt rather shallow, especially at a whopping 142 minutes. Now, I'm not going to imply that the praise stems from this being a minority story, inventively told, with a dash of social commentary added in for good measure, because there are way too many people creaming their pants over this film and it can't just be a virtue signaling thing. It's very well made, I'll give it that, and its success is somewhat groundbreaking for Asians in Hollywood, so I'll let it slide. The top-billed performances are also fantastic (especially Michelle Yeoh), the fighting choreography is visually inventive, and it's just a very ambitious venture for these indie filmmakers. The first hour is actually fairly solid, but, boy does it also overstay its welcome. The anxiety-ridden immigrant family at the center of the film just want to get their taxes done, and the subtle absurdism in this first stretch of the film is wonderfully told.  Then, at some point, multiverses pack onto other multiverses, hot-dog fingers show up, not to mention a black hole bagel becoming central to the story and it inevitably becomes pointlessly complicated. The emotional aspects at the climax also feel too obvious and unearned. Dare I say it, the film is a plasticized depiction of generational trauma. It's all so very densely packed and gimmicky as well. The confetti puke was a nice touch, I'll admit that, ditto the costume design. However, this is the most ""millennial"" movie I have ever seen, as a certain philosophy ruminates throughout the film. Cue in the nihilism. The movie basically says the world is a place that's chaotic and void of meaning, so any kind of social development or progress is just an illusion, unless, of course, you learn to love. It might just be the most Reddit-approved movie"

The movie contains some Christian and redeeming elements such as the importance of family, the power of good virtues and self-mastery. The main character risks her life to save her daughter. Her husband is the epitome of kindness, patience and generosity. However, the movie is marred with pervasive graphic violence, some sexual violence, including a few brief scenes involving bondage, some strong obscenities, and politically correct commentary on homosexual unions. The movie's excessively bizarre and irrational behavior, along with the false ideology of a sentient multiverse, gives the feeling of almost two and a half hours of a drug-induced psychotic episode. Media-wise moviegoers will want to pass on this one. Evelyn Wang is an anxiety ridden, disgruntled Chinese immigrant who runs a laundromat. She continuously laments over her poor life choices. She believes she should have followed the advice of her overbearing father to not marry her husband, Waymond. The ever patient Waymond has finally had enough abuse and decides to serve his wife with divorce papers. Meanwhile, their daughter, Joy, follows the neurotic Evelyn around the laundromat trying to make her invite her lesbian partner to a party Evelyn is planning for her very traditional, strict and demanding father. Joy refuses to respect her mother's wishes of not wanting to upset her father in his old age. Evelyn avoids closeness with Joy with her own busyness. She also dismisses Joy and calls her fat.

So, now, Evelyn must travel to other universes to connect with better versions of herself to find the skills to fight the great evil, which has become personified in her daughter, Joy. Joy, Waymond and the villains ""verse jump"" by acting out in bizarre and grotesque ways. These actions range from romantically professing love to a woman trying to kill her, feeding her father his own nose matter, and jumping on large objects to lodge them in the anal cavity.

XSP_Doc1_MinorityReport,XSP,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority Report," Steven Spielberg's Minority Report realizes the full potential of author Philip K. Dick's science-fiction worldview, a perspective filled with dangerous technology, feverish paranoia, and metaphysical philosophies. Spielberg's complicated, wonderfully stylized approach uses Dick's 1956 short story of the same name as a launching pad. While it captures the author's vision of an imperfect future and the perilous reality that dwells under the alluring surface of futurism, the picture also stands as Spielberg's most extraordinary exhibit of pure filmmaking. Minority Report augments and expands on the source material, concentrating Dick's obsessions about the potential dangers of technology and the author's ongoing existential battle between free will and determinism, especially in regard to the manipulation of time, such as time travel or precognition. Over more than forty novels and several short story collections, Dick's work permeates a sense of fascination and suspicion toward the future. The fascinating prospect of new technologies, exploration of new frontiers, and humanity's evolutionary progression of extra-sensory perceptions consume his output. And yet, he always investigates their inevitable downfalls. His stories feature characters hindered by supposed advancements, thrown into the central conflict by a set of circumstances put into motion by unsound developments. In that tradition, Spielberg's film is a nonstop chase, at once a thriller of epic escapist and intellectual bravado. It amalgamates Hitchcockian suspense, elements of film noir, and Dick's vision of the future, three of the most distinctive and inventive of all storytelling styles, into a single source, resulting in a masterful triumph from a masterful filmmaker.  Set in the near-future, Minority Report introduces the concept of Precrime, Washington D.C.'s exploration into a revolutionary form of law enforcement. Founded by Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow) and headed by Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise), Precrime utilizes the ""gifts"" of the Precogs, three clairvoyants who have given up their freedom to support the cause of detecting crimes before they occur. The Precogs' foreseen visions are analyzed by the Precrime unit and verified by a council of judges; a positive mark is identified, and suddenly officers race to prevent a crime from taking place. Impending perpetrators are caught and then booked before ever committing an offense. When the film opens, there hasn't been a murder in the District of Columbia for six years; the existence of Precrime alone virtually eliminates the consideration of murder, so only crimes of passion remain. Though dedicated to the ideology of Precrime, Anderton's personal life is in shambles. Long ago, his young son disappeared at a public pool; now a divorcÃ©, he whiffs neural drugs to escape the guilt and painful memories of his former life. On the job, however, he remains professional and composed. In the opening scenes, Justice Department representative Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) enters the Precrime offices to audit the program for national expansion and meets Anderton, who jealously protects the system he helped build. Witwer's insistence that a human component will ultimately threaten the countrywide growth of Precrime quickly proves true after the Precogs predict that Anderton will commit a"

Anderton specializes in ""red ball"" situations (designated by an elaborate computer system synced to the Precogs brains that spits out colored wooden orbs), such as 1108, which are crimes of passion - since there's no premeditation, these murders can only be seen a few hours or minutes prior to the event. This new scheme is the ultimate invasion of privacy - and it's on the verge of sweeping the nation. Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is sent from the Attorney General of the United States to determine if there are any flaws in the system before the program spreads to other districts. Since humans run it, there will be inevitable glitches. The first problem occurs when John digs around the archives looking for a specific murder case in which the killer was apprehended but never identified. Each case is supposed to have three previsions, one from each Precog - the most powerful auger being the catatonic Agatha (Samantha Morton). But several of Agatha's files are missing. The following day, the divine trio have another visual prophecy - one in which Anderton himself is the murderer. In the future, automated eye scan devices identify everyone so that movements across the city cannot occur without government knowledge. It's a scarily authoritarian arrangement designed to demonstrate the oppression and faults of a Big Brother world. And it's just a piece of a rather impressive conceptualization of the dictatorial, slave-to-technology years to come, mixed with darker, noirish elements of grime and shadows (like an updated ""Blade Runner"" setting). Other visual accessories and indications of scientific advancements include an innovative, computerized workspace (in which files float across translucent screens - an idea frequently spoofed and copied), high-speed cars that move up and down skyscrapers, three-dimensional memory files, and rickety jetpacks. Additionally, Paul Verhoeven-styled, commercial-like news updates and invasive media is blasted through enormous monitors stationed throughout the city. As an action picture more predominantly than a thinking man's piece, the stunts and chases are nicely choreographed, further embellished with fitting music by John Williams. It's a light-hearted type of violent adventure along the lines of a futuristic Indiana Jones (or any of Schwarzenegger's sci-fi works), with cleverer escapes and showdowns, and subtle humor fused into the combat. The level of fantasy frequently rivals the severer science-fiction elements, radiating Spielberg's brand of lively storytelling. The blue-and-black, muted, desaturated cinematography sharply aids the tone of ""Minority Report,"" which, for a Philip K. Dick adaptation, possesses quite the focus on thrills and destruction over satire and criticism. And indeed, while the story is superbly complex, twisting and turning with expert elusiveness"
XSP_Doc3_MinorityReport,XSP,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority Report,"Minority Report might take place some fifty years after the film was shot but the film's themes are still relevant almost twenty years later. This film marks the first collaboration between Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise.  The film has audiences asking some important questions.  What if we knew what was going to happen in the future?  After you ask yourself the question, what if the person knowing this found out he was going to kill someone?  This is the gist of the film, which is based on the Philip K. Dick short story.  Another thing here is that the audience must be able to buy into the science early on in the film. This is key to being able to just sit back and enjoy the ride.  If you're watching the film for the first time in 2020, the science is very believable.  It's amazing how much of the science is catching up right in front of us. There's something to be said about the eye-dentification.  Social media platforms already know our faces.  Companies target us online because of internet cookies.  One could look at author Philip K. Dick as a prophet in the world of science-fiction.  In case you didn't know, Dick is also the man behind Blade Runner.  One of the film's main themes is free will vs. determinism.  The film handles this so beautifully.  If we know our future, could we possibly do something to change it? The Department of PreCrime, at least in what we see on screen, is mostly focusing on preventing murders.  This is where the three pre-cognitives are the main focus.  Two twin males and one female share a common trait.  They see the future and the visions appear on a giant screen.  Together, they're able to see the future.  They have no interaction with the outside world.  The department's agents work to arrest people on the basis of the visions. PreCrime Captain John Anderton (Tom Cruise) has turned to drugs since his son, Sean, disappeared.  Anderton is also separated from his wife, Lara (Kathryn Morris).  Anderton just happens to have the unfortunate luck of being in the pre-cogs vision when DOJ agent Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is visiting the agency.  Talk about bad luck!  Anderton now goes on the run and PreCrime creator Dr. Iris Hineman (Lois Smith) tells him that Agatha (Samantha Morton) sometimes has a different vision.  Dr. Hineman refers to this as a ""minority report."" There's a lot of mystery in the film surrounding the death of Ann Lively (Jessica Harper).  She just happens to be Agatha's mother.  The further we get into the film, Anderton learns that he's being framed.  Meanwhile, Witwer starts studying the available footage and starts to believe the same.  Anybody in the right mind would do what he does next.  But what Witwer doesn't know is that the director"

Pre-Crime is a new law system where people known as pre-cognitive are used as machines which can foretell the future and predict a major crime. Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, one of the best officers who bust the people who commit the pre-crimes. The system is perfect, flawless and it does the job... but what happens when the system turns on you? Now, accused of killing a man in thirty-six hours he doesn't know, he is now on the run from his own task force and a Government official (Colin Farrell) who wants him at all costs.  I am a huge fan of Steven Spielberg's works. So, it was no surprise I'd try and check this out as soon as possible. I became a little jaded by his latest work ""A.I."" which was sub-par, gloomy, and very confusing. I had my doubts going into this, but as I suspected I was in for a good time. This has to be one of Spielberg's best ever; we instantly begin to become dazzled as Spielberg leaves us in awe with an incredible world which seems to be a mix of futuristic landscapes and skyscrapers mixed with small town suburbia and old-fashioned houses. We also get an amazing view of the highways of the future as cars not only drive along the ground but up on the sides of building into the skies.  The city is very overcome by computer -generated ads by fashion companies and commercials that know our names and offer us products non-stop. We're also kept under monitor as our eyes are scanned and indexed before we enter anyplace from bathrooms to trains. We get this view of the new world which is beautiful yet still very dangerous. The cast is phenomenal as Tom Cruise is at his top as John Anderton. We believe he is in danger and never doubt his desperation. I always question Tom Cruise as an actor, but this movie has proven me wrong.  We get excellent stunts performed by Cruise himself as he scrambles desperately throughout the movie attempting to cheat a system that is basically fail safe. Colin Farrell is also truly excellent as Danny Witwer, the suspicious government operative who questions the system's accuracy and will stop at nothing to catch John. The two plays off each other very well in action scenes and truly have excellent chemistry as they throw dialogue back and forth to one another, challenging each other's expertise. Max Von Sydow is a great compliment to this movie as Tom's Mentor and often his confidant helping him to fight off the law.  The movie makes itself out to be a man-on-the-run movie when truly it is an intricate Hitchcockian murder mystery with plot twists and turns at every corner that kept me on the edge of my seat.

XSP_Doc5_MinorityReport,XSP,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority Report,"The work of the late Philip K Dick has been a fertile source for films since Ridley Scott's Blade Runner in 1982. The latest gloomy futuristic vision, from a 1956 Dick short story, is Steven Spielberg's Minority Report, which takes themes from Blade Runner, Total Recall and especially the little seen Gary Fleder-directed Impostor and stirs them up into an absorbing thriller. The end result manages to be mainstream-friendly enough - just - to guarantee blockbuster status this summer in North America, the UK and Asian territories and throughout the rest of the world in the autumn. Unlike AI: Artificial Intelligence from Spielberg last year, Minority Report pushes all the right buttons as a crowd-pleasing entertainment, while allowing the director to imagine a future in Washington DC 2054 which is decidedly despondent. Reviews in North America have been excellent, and an opening weekend take of $36m is as strong as can be expected from a new film by Spielberg - especially one starring Tom Cruise.   Will Minority Report go down as one of Spielberg's greats, however' The answer to that question is probably no. Unlike Ridley Scott, who broke so many rules in Blade Runner and foretold a future so bleak as to provoke indifference with audiences at the time, the warm-and-fuzzy Spielberg can't quite go all the way. As in AI, he refuses to end on a sour note or be shaken from the belief that family life is the core component of a healthy society. It's not sentimentality as much as optimism - a virtue to be sure, but one which doesn't sit well in this dark conceptualisation of the near future, nor with Dick's visions of an Orwellian society in which privacy is unavailable and individual happiness is cheap. Even the drug-addicted lead character is unambiguously a hero. Those positive values will be rewarded with box office glory but are unlikely to give Minority Report the legendary status of more daring films like 2001: A Space Odyssey or Blade Runner. What's more, despite the superb quality of the film-making, the film doesn't feel particularly fresh. Dimension's Impostor, which had a brief US run in January this year, features a strikingly similar set-up, plot structure and vision of the future - right down to the retinal scans which give law enforcement the location of their citizens at all times. When a pursued Cruise breaks back into the facility where he used to work, the comparison with a pursued Gary Sinise doing exactly the same thing in Impostor is inevitable. The film spends a good third of its running time on exposition. Three psychics - called ""pre-cogs"" - are able to see future murders in their minds and the images of those murders are then downloaded to be analysed by an elite pre-crime unit led by Chief John Anderton (Cruise). Anderton and his team subsequently race against the clock to prevent the impending crimes and capture the hypothetical murderers. The unit's track record is impeccable and the system, currently only operational"
XSP_Doc6_MinorityReport,XSP,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority Report,"Once again this year we are graced with a futuristic sci-fi flick based on a short story by the visionary Philip Dick, this time in the form of ""Minority Report"", which poses the intriguing hypothesis: What if we could see into the future and arrest people before they commit a murder, or any other crime for that matter? Set in the year 2054 in Washington, D.C., Tom Cruise stars as John Anderton, who, having lost his son, now does his best to prevent murders before they happen as Chief of the elite Pre-Crime Division of the Justice Department. Assisting him are three genetically altered precognitives known as ""Pre-Cogs"" who are attached to machines that record their visions of murders which are ""set"" to occur anywhere from a few minutes to four days into the future. With each vision, two wooden balls roll out of the machine attachment, each one bearing the name of the killer and victim. As a result of this ""perfect"" system, Washington, D.C. is now murder free. (Let's face it, given our life and times, Dick should have set this scenario in 3054 to have any plausibility.) Believing the Pre-Cogs infallible, Anderton advocates nationalizing the Pre-Crime system, that is until the Justice Department questions the methods and techniques utilized by the Division and Anderton himself becomes the subject of a Pre-Cog vision seeing him committing a murder. Suddenly questioning the accuracy of the system (since he of course knows he's innocent and will continue to be innocent), Anderton goes on the run, stealing a female Pre-Cog named Agatha, setting us up for what now becomes a routine futuristic chase movie. Directed by Steven Spielberg, ""Minority Report"" reeks of the darker tone and color desaturation found in Spielberg's last futuristic foray, ""A.I."", a technique that works well in this type of film and once again is executed beautifully by long time Spielberg cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. Hand in hand with Kaminski's artistic flair, are some dazzling special effects action sequences, including a chase on a vertical highway that is so impressive, you have to see it to believe it. (Warning - those with severe motion sickness may want to cover their eyes at this part.) Not to be outdone, many scenes which one would believe are special effects, are in fact, the result of elaborately and elegantly choreographed camera maneuvers which are expertly executed and utilized for maximum dramatic effect. Cruise performs admirably as Anderton, using physicality and controlled raw emotion to their best advantage as he manipulates not only his pursuers, but the audience as well. An excellent counterpoint to Cruise's energetic yet psychologically tormented Anderton is Samantha's Moore portrayal of Pre-Cog Agatha - tacit, ethereal and seemingly helpless. Max von Sydow, no stranger to the futuristic and fantastic (""Dune"", ""Judge Dredd"" and ""The Exorcist"") steps in as Anderton's superior, Bureau Director Burgess, exhibiting an almost fatherly pride in his protÃ©gÃ© Anderton while relative newcomer, Colin Farrell is perfectly cast as the bureaucratic FBI investigator Danny Witwer who evokes a"
XSP_Doc7_MinorityReport,XSP,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority Report,"In Minority Report, a futuristic thriller set in 2054, murder has been eliminated in Washington DC thanks to a division of law enforcement known as Precrime. Tapping into the minds of the Pre-Cogs, a trio of psychics who can foresee the future, Precrime is able to track down and arrest would-be killers before they actually commit their lethal deeds. The system appears to be flawless. But when police chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise), the head of this controversial department, is himself accused of the future murder of a man he hasn't even met, he sets out to prove his innocence, all the while hunted by his fellow officers.  Based on a 1956 short story by renowned science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, Minority Report is typical of director Steven Spielberg in how it deftly melds flashy entertainment with critical issues. The movie is made up of three major ingredients: the thrilling action of an innocent man running from the law; the cautionary tale of how good intentions can go astray when not tempered by wisdom (specifically, infringing on people's civil liberties in the name of protecting them); and the old debate of human free will versus pre-ordained destiny. Unfortunately, the movie's philosophical elements take a backseat to John's mundane escape from authorities.  Clearly, I understand that the relentless manhunt is more important than a bunch of metaphysical mumbo jumbo to most people. But without the pre-determined fate aspect, Minority Report is really nothing more than your standard crime drama, complete with cliches ranging from the generic framing of an innocent man to the corruption in the ranks of the police. I'm not asking for a stuffy dissertation that bores audiences like the sterile Solaris--just a comfortable balance that gives a little more substantial acknowledgement to the concept of being able to control one's own future.  As it is, the film only briefly engages the notion of pre-determination intelligently when John debates Precrime issues with Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell), an agent from the Justice Department who has been ordered to find flaws in the system. John's argument of an absolute future is just about the most interesting and thought-provoking moment of the whole movie, although the scene quickly gives way to nonsense that stretches even the boundaries of science fiction (a claim that the Pre-Cogs can only foresee homicides because ""there's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another"" puts an arbitrary importance on human lives). Credibility is further shot when the story dissolves into trite cheerleading that all but says, ""You can do it! You control your destiny! Go, John!""  Cruise's frequent failure to convey emotion makes his character of John Anderton less than interesting. We see none of his conviction in the ideas of justice, none of his sense of betrayal when the system turns on him, and none of his paranoia in a suddenly hostile world. In an attempt to elicit sympathy and establish John's dedication to fighting crime, the"
XSP_Doc8_MinorityReport,XSP,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority Report,"What new hell is this? In the shallow, noisy and pretentious Minority Report , we have seen the future. It's not pretty. There are two Steven Spielbergs. One is the cinematic historian who instructs, informs and shapes a universal consciousness that makes us aware of our stake in the human race in masterpieces like Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan . The other is a 12-year-old comic-book collector weaned on sci-fi and stuck in the twilight zone of his own nursery, who turns out polished but moronic time-wasters about dinosaurs, space ships, Indiana Jones and Peter Pan. Quel doppelg?nger . I always have a hard time believing the same man capable of both greatness ( The Color Purple ) and trash ( Jurassic Park ). Occasionally, a film like E.T. or Raiders of the Lost Ark emerges to meld the technical proficiency of the craftsman with the passion of the storyteller. Bloody, violent, cold and preposterous, Minority Report is not one of them. Despite an astronomical budget and a gallimaufry of twists and turns enhanced by special effects, Minority Report has a boring, one-dimensional story line you could write on one page of Big Chief tablet paper with a No. 2 lead pencil. Derived from a story by sci-fi spinmaster Philip K. Dick (the man responsible for Blade Runner ), it's set in Washington, D.C., in 2054. Crime has been wiped out thanks to an experimental Pre-Crime Unit called a ""priori,"" developed by wacko scientist Max von Sydow, that can predict murders before they happen. Tom Cruise plays Detective John Anderton, the futuristic cop in charge of preventing homicides with the aid of three psychic visionaries called ""Pre-Cogs"" who float around in a liquid wading pool wired, drugged and having nightmares. Waving his arms like Leonard Bernstein in the orchestra pit, Anderton can download images of clues, suspects and crime scenes, then lead his futuristic crimebusters to the killers before they pull the trigger. With beady eyes, flexed jaw and a buzz cut, he's a man whose life is already so haunted by the abduction and murder of his only son that he looks and acts creepier than the Pre-Cogs. The world has apparently survived John Ashcroft, because the Justice Department thinks the Pre-Crime Unit is too controversial a concept to go national. In a subplot that goes nowhere, Irish hunk Colin Farrell is wasted as the dull F.B.I. investigator from the Attorney General's office who covets Anderton's job. The lulling narrative drones on until the tables turn and Anderton is named by the Pre-Cogs as the next murderer. From here, the movie turns from a whodunit into a who'll-do-it as the flawed hero (he's hooked on drugs) has 36 hours to solve his own case and clear his name by breaking into the Pre-Crime lab and downloading the info from the Pre-Cog who predicted it-and Mr. Spielberg sweats it all out, stretching the film's playing time to two hours plus.

XSP_Doc9_MinorityReport,XSP,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority Report,"    Most of the hope that I had for Minority Report, Steven Spielberg's adaptation of a classic Phillip K. Dick short story drained away early on, as soon as I saw one overly cute element of the film's set design. In Spielberg's vision of the near future (2054, to be exact), the Precogs, a trio of clairvoyant crack babies, are used to predict murders so they can be stopped before they are committed. To illustrate the process by which their predictions are delivered to the policemen that investigate them, he uses, for no good reason a spiraling glass ramp that delivers colorful balls with the perpetrator and victims' names on them. It's a distinctive touch, to be sure, and its one that could only exist in a child's vision of the future, and it feels entirely out of place among the sterile metal look that dominates the rest of the set. This fragment of his future is indicative of Minority Report's biggest problems, however. Spielberg uses images that could fascinate a child in his designs in hopes that they will appeal to everyone, and the resultant effect is the creation of a science fiction future that feels emotionally familiar and comfortable. While that might be some sort of achievement in itself, it works entirely against the plot of Report, which attempts to show us the dehumanizing effects of the invasion of privacy in its futuristic police state.      Unlike Dick, Spielberg's doesn't use science fiction to provide a cautionary and predictive look at the future. It instead fuels childish hope that all wishes will come true and fantasies will be fulfilled if we just have patience (consider ending of A.I. in this light). That's precisely why he's so wrong for this material. He has faith in happy endings even under totalitarianism, even when they make no emotional sense. In Minority Report, Spielberg's characters revert to using old technology (as opposed to the impotent, non-lethal weapons of the future) whenever someone actually dies, and by doing this he's suggesting that the human foibles and flaws that allow murder to happen are outmoded artifacts that will hopefully be phased out soon. This notion completely contradicts the film's ending, which vehemently denounces technology, and embraces those flaws. The way that the film is shot, though, it appears as if all of the color has been desaturated from the future world, leaving a pseudo-black and white wannabe-noir look, and that lack of shading is appropriate considering the sheer simplicity of the film's morality and symbolism. The attempts to push the morality of the characters into gray areas are so obviously going to be overcome by the film's end that they are completely ineffective in making the movie any more complex. The symbolism is even more laughably heavy handed. Early on, one character explicitly points out how goofy the clunky religious symbolism (there's a Holy Trinity, a Temple where humans play God, halos placed on convicts, etc...) that the movie"
XSP_Doc10_MinorityReport,XSP,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority Report,"Set in the year 2054, Steven Spielberg's Minority Report looks clammy and bleached-out. The oppressiveness, of course, is intentional, but is it necessary? High-concept science-fiction escapades often try to impose new ways of seeing, but Spielberg seems intent on blistering our optic nerves. Like A.I., Minority Report is a movie in furious conflict with itself. Hope is pitted, rather unsuccessfully, against dystopia -- or is it dyspepsia? The result is one of the glummest and most forbidding thrillers ever.  Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, who runs the Justice Department's Precrime unit, which acts on evidence provided by three human ""Pre-cogs"" who float in a liquid suspension chamber and can see visions of future murders. The images they transmit are displayed in haphazard fragments on a giant screen before which Anderton stands like a maestro, sorting out the pictures with sweeping waves of his arms. The garish, fractured visuals may cause some in the audience to experience dÃ©jÃ  vu: Can it be that the Pre-cogs are channeling the credit sequence from Seven?  The Precrime cops, tipped by the trio, swoop down and arrest potential murderers, who are contained in a comatose state in long pneumatic tubes while their misdeeds are played out before their eyes. The moral dilemma is that none of the convicted is actually guilty of anything in the present. But because the Pre-cogs are supposed to be infallible, and because the murder rate in Washington, D.C., for the past six years has dropped to zero, the public is enthusiastic, and there is a political initiative pending to make Precrime go national. Then comes the twist: Anderton is implicated in the murder, within 36 hours, of a man he doesn't even know. Believing himself innocent and set up by his enemies, he goes on the lam. Either he is a murderer-to-be or the Pre-cogs are wrong -- which would call into question everything Anderton stands for as a crime fighter.  There are some extraordinary sequences in Minority Report, and they are almost always the ones in which Spielberg lets loose his genius for graphic movement. In one scene, Anderton jumps across lanes of magnetic-levitation cars that speed both horizontally and vertically through the automated cityscape. In the film's best set piece, he submerges himself in a bathtub while mechanical spiders try to identify him by scanning his retina. (The action is so astonishingly deft that the pop of a single air bubble caps the scene.) The futurist vision of a consumer society in Minority Report -- which was written by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen and very loosely based on a longish and dullish 1956 Philip K. Dick story -- is alarmingly plausible. By scanning our eyes, companies will track our whereabouts and personalize the hard sell as never before. Malls will be lined with talking billboards on a first-name basis with us. (This is the rare movie where the plethora of product placements actually serves a legitimate dramatic function.)

By the time you know all the answers, you're wondering what went wrong with the movie. Although it looks spectacular and boasts some pungent ideas, the surprise-to-running-time ratio is out of whack. Tom Cruise acts more relaxed than usual as Jack Harper, Tech 49, the post-apocalyptic grease monkey who narrates the film. He tells us that after earthlings beat off an invasion from alien (Scavengers) (or just plain (Scavs)), Jack and the awesomely efficient Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) were dispatched to run an epic salvage job from a glittering condo in the clouds. They live in what must be the highest-rent district of the atmosphere, somewhere over the ruins of Manhattan. You see, the good guys won the war but lost the planet. After the Scavs cleverly wrecked the moon, catalyzing natural disasters, the humans went nuclear, destroying what was left of the environment. Under the orders of their mission commander, Sally (Melissa Leo), Jack and Victoria maintain (hydro-rigs) that suck up the planet's water for relocation to Titan, the largest moon of Saturn and the new home for Earth's population. With Victoria running the communications desk, Jack roams the Eastern seaboard in a (bubble ship) that resembles a souped-up, weaponized whirlybird. He rescues and repairs deadly flying drones that protect the hydro-rigs from what's left of the Scavs. The drones murder any Scavs they cast their digital eyes on. The war between Scavs and humans sounds like a valid description of what we see before our eyes, but you may have your doubts within minutes. Director Joseph Kosinski and his co-writers (William Monahan, Karl Gajdusek and Michael Arndt), try to play fair with the audience but tip their hands too quickly. When Jack finds a new-grown flower and brings it back to base in a tin can, we're not shocked that Victoria tosses it out, blaming her fear of toxins. We know there's something off about Victoria, we just don't know what. She responds as if brainwashed to commander Sally's daily question, (Are you an effective team?) With so few characters on hand, it's a mistake for a tricky screenplay to plant so many clues early on. Not even dandy shoot-outs and breathtaking vistas can distract you from figuring out their general motivations. We should respond to the mysteries-within-mysteries of (Oblivion) with the delight of children opening a stack of Russian nesting dolls. Sadly, the film lacks the necessary brilliance or grace or spark of originality. Sci-fi zealots might find it fun to count off the references to (La Jetee,) (Planet of the Apes,) (2001: A Space Odyssey,) and (The Empire Strikes Back.) But even they might consider this film's use of music heavy-handed. The score by the chic French electronic band M83 keeps thudding away; Kosinski lathers it on as if in a panic about holding our interest. In one chase scene the pounding stops just long enough for Jack to ask his passenger, (You"
RTD_Doc2_Oblivion,RTD,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion,"It's apparent now, after two similarly pristine and vacuous productions, that Joseph Kosinski makes films as if he were building IKEA furniture: He follows a simple template, allen-keys the requisite pieces into place, and at the end of the process winds up with something both blandly functional and broadly appealing. It's worth remembering thatTRON: Legacybegan as nothing more than a glorified tech demo, a studio-backed sizzle reel intended to promote Kosinski's aesthetic proclivities as much as the forthcoming project itself. With Kosinski, superficiality seems a veritable guiding principle with the architecture of the world constructed from clean lines and gleaming neon blues-persists undiminished in his blockbuster follow-up, a film which exchanges the cool digital palette of its predecessor for something nominally earthier, but every bit as lifeless and cold. Oblivion's defining quality isn't precision so much as the illusion thereof. It strains to establish an aura of formal rigor and artisanal meticulousness in every aspect of its design, presumably intended to eclipse the fact that, at its foundation,Oblivionis rather crudely assembled, an ad-hoc B movie composed of borrowed plot points and shopworn sci-fi clichÃ©s. Rarely has a veneer of consummate craftsmanship so conspicuously endeavored to compensate for the flimsiness of a film's conception, slathering every frame in so much high-gloss texture.Oblivion's chief purpose-rather than, say, to relate an interesting story, or have us invest ourselves in the plight of believable characters, or articulate an idea about the world in which we live-is to erect a monument to itself: Its multi-million-dollar budget is directed toward shallow self-aggrandizement, forging lavish futurist skyscrapers and Emmerichian old-world wreckage from the expensive digital ether, and just generally illustrating the aftermath of our apocalypse with less imagination than disdain for the intelligence of its audience. It should be obvious within seconds thatOblivionis pure amateur hour even in the most rudimentary ways. This sort of viewer-insulting writing is entirely typical of the film's continuing deference to simplicity, where every sensationalistic twist is either telegraphed too far in advance or all too cheaply withheld, the sum total of its gasp-stacking turnabouts little more thanMoonmeets a thinly veiledLa JetÃ©e-or, frankly, any other two science-fiction films with novel twists you'd care to name, sinceOblivionis indiscriminate about the sources it rips off. Aliens appear, things are more than they seem, major moral questions are grasped at, but barely engaged with; it's primetime TV as sci-fi mega-blockbuster. There's a great track on M83'sBefore the Dawn Heals Uscalled (Car Chase Terror!) that's essentially a declaration of the group's aesthetic sensibility. This might sound inconsequential, but it's deeply indicative of the film's misunderstanding of its inherent ridiculousness: Rather than either wholly embrace or reject the silliness of the material, Kosinski opts instead to play it safe in the middle, delving headlong into schmaltz without going far enough to emerge on the other side. The result is every bit as ludicrous as the clichÃ©s of the genre dictate, but absent any sense of self-awareness,Oblivionseems only self-serious, a ponderous mess both misguided and unaware."
RTD_Doc3_Oblivion,RTD,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion,"If nothing else, ""Oblivion"" will go down in film history as the movie where Tom Cruise pilots a white, sperm-shaped craft into a giant space uterus. The scene is more interesting to describe than it is to watch. Cruise's sperm-ship enters through an airlock that resembles a geometrized vulva. He arrives inside a massive chamber lined with egg-like glass bubbles. At the center of the chamber is a pulsating, sentient triangle that is also supposed to be some kind of mother figure. Cruise must destroy the mother triangle and her space uterus in order to save the Earth. Like director Joseph Kosinski's debut, ""Tron: Legacy"" (2010), ""Oblivion"" is a special effects extravaganza with a lot of blatant symbolism and very little meaning. It starts slow, turns dull and then becomes tedious - which makes it a marginal improvement over the earlier film. It features shiny surfaces, clicky machinery and no recognizable human behavior. It's equally ambitious and gormless. ""Oblivion"" is set in the year 2077, 60 years after an alien invasion rendered the Earth largely uninhabitable. Cruise stars as Jack Harper, one of a handful of people left on the planet. The other survivors have long since relocated to Titan. Harper and colleagues remain as technicians, servicing robot drones that defend resource-gathering stations from alien stragglers. It goes without saying that the flight recorder unearths all kinds of secrets about Harper, Vica, and the alien invasion. It also creates one of the movie's more glaring logical errors, but that's a different story altogether. The film's opening stretch is its one strong point -  a gradual, immersive build-up of details. It's a smart technique for science-fiction storytelling; it eases the viewer into the world of the film. The problem is that the world ""Oblivion"" introduces - an abandoned, depopulated Earth - is more interesting than the story it tells. Or, more accurately, the stories it tells, because ""Oblivion,"" derivative to a fault, tries to be several science-fiction movies at once. It tries and it fails. ""Oblivion"" is a political allegory about a lowly ""technician"" sending unmanned drones to hunt and kill a demonized, alien Other - until it forgets that it ever was. It's a wannabe mindbender that raises questions about its lead character's identity - except that the lead character is too sketchy to make these questions compelling. It's a story about humans struggling for survival in an environment controlled by technology - except it appears to be much more interested in the technology than in the humans. It's a rah-rah action flick - except its action scenes aren't very good. The only thread ""Oblivion"" follows to the end is its ""creation myth."" Harper is an idealized man; he's good with a gun, good with his hands, good in bed, loves football and rides a motorcycle. Though most of the movie's characters are women, not one of them is able to do anything without Harper's help - not even the mother triangle that lives in the space uterus. Only his rugged-but-sensitive masculinity holds"
RTD_Doc4_Oblivion,RTD,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"Science fiction is always more about the present, and even the past, than it is about the future, which by definition we don't know anything about. That's certainly true of (Oblivion,) the sly, surprising and visually magnificent Tom Cruise vehicle that has forced me - and many other people, I suspect - to revise my first opinion of director Joseph Kosinski. In fact, on some bizarre level (Oblivion) feels like a more grown-up and vastly improved version of Kosinski's murky and ludicrous (TRON: Legacy,) a movie I compared to sticking your head into a barrel of ink full of fluorescent glow-sticks. Like that movie, (Oblivion) incorporates all sorts of themes, ideas and images from science-fiction cinema of the last several decades, including (Blade Runner,) (The Matrix,) (Total Recall,) (2001: A Space Odyssey) and Andrei Tarkovsky's (Solaris,) among others. It explores nearly the same territory of loss, loneliness and rediscovery, but the philosophical veneer and the reverent design aesthetic fit a whole lot better when the whole story doesn't take place inside a 1980s video game. I'm sure some people will see (Oblivion) as another Philip K. Dick rehash -- to be clear, it's not based on any of his material -- but to my mind Kosinski and co-writers Karl Gajdusek and Michael Arndt have synthesized all these influences into a witty and elegant post-apocalyptic parable that's well suited to our age of asymmetrical warfare and even asymmetrical reality. Since every poster for this movie has Morgan Freeman in it, I'm probably OK saying that he and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (of (Game of Thrones)) show up as the leaders of a renegade band of humans - and that they and Julia aren't the only living people Jack finds on the planet. If a lot of the second half of (Oblivion) is fairly standard action cinema - a guy and a girl, on the run and looking for answers - their setting and situation is always visually striking. Whatever you make of Tom Cruise as a person or personality, he has a sharp eye for material and understands his own limits; in the last couple of years he's homed in on playing the iconic Troubled Guy Who Knows Too Much. This is at least the third strong Cruise performance in a row, after (Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol) and (Jack Reacher) (hell, let's throw in (Knight and Day,) even though it wasn't a hit). Is it possible or plausible that the metaphorical, David vs. Goliath level of (Oblivion) will strike some deep cultural and political chord, the way the Wachowskis did in 1999 with the first (Matrix)? Not really - that layer of the movie is in there, for those who yearn for it, but (Oblivion) is a much cooler movie, temperature-wise, not bursting with ideas in quite the same way and much more a visual tribute to the world of Tarkovsky and R.W. Fassbinder. (Oblivion) is a technical triumph rather than a philosophical breakthrough, demonstrating how beautifully digital effects can be blended with real people"
RTD_Doc5_Oblivion,RTD,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion,"Remember when the movies held the impending extinction of human life on the planet as a worst-case scenario - something that could and would be heroically averted, if only at the last second? Nowadays, the end times are only the beginning: an apocalyptic backdrop is something we're going to be seeing a lot of this year, so we might as well get used to it. In the glossy, derivative, ambitious and fatally underpowered (Oblivion,) Tom Cruise is the last guy on Earth. He's Jack, a technician - a mechanic, really - whose job is to fix broken down drones (in a cute touch he sticks the first one back together with chewing gum). In other words, he's a bit like WALL-E, and Andrea Riseborough is his latter day Eve. That's what the drones are for: to kill off the last remaining hostiles, or (scavs,) who have taken refuge on the edge of the radioactive wastelands that cover most of the globe. That's more than enough backstory, I know, but there's much more to come out, even as Jack goes about his daily routine, tracking down lost drones, revisiting ruined New York landmarks (the top of the Empire State Building now sits at ground level on a sea of dust), and occasionally going AWOL himself to grapple with fragmentary memories of a beautiful girl (Olga Kurylenko), and a lost world he has no right to remember. The story is officially credited to an unpublished comic book by the film's director, Joseph Kosinski. But if you poured all the most memorable sci-fi films from the past half century into a blender, from (2001: A Space Odyssey) and the original (Planet of the Apes) all the way down to last year's (Prometheus,) you would probably wind up with something very similar and equally synthetic - though quite possibly more exciting.  While he immerses us in an often dazzling futurescape, for the most part Kosinski ((Tron: Legacy)) lacks the poetic imagination to animate this requiem for a dying world - comparisons with (WALL-E) are certainly not to this film's advantage - and fails to convince us that he genuinely cares about the fate of his characters, let alone the planet. The movie's few action scenes are competent but unlikely to wow any battle-seasoned gamers out there. Kosinski does produce one rabbit from his hat, a real surprise late in the game that sends the movie for a loop, but also undermines a good deal of the credibility he's worked hard to build up over the preceding hour and a half or so. Like (Prometheus,) this is another of those earnest, overdetermined spiritual allegories that falls apart in the rear-view mirror. It is certainly nice to look at though. Director of photography Claudio Miranda was last seen picking up an Academy Award for his breathtaking work on (Life of Pi,) and his images of an Earth turned to ash are almost as alluring. They're enough to lend the picture a sense of scope and even grandeur, but"
RTD_Doc6_Oblivion,RTD,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"(Oblivion) looks marvelous, in the deliciously dystopian way of so many post-apocalyptic films. It's set in 2077, after alien invaders called Scavengers (or (Scavs)) have laid waste to our moon, leading to cataclysmic floods and earthquakes that have ravaged Earth. The film features gorgeous CGI shots of such broken, half-buried landmarks as the Washington Monument and the Empire State Building, whose observation deck can now be accessed by walking onto it from a mountain of rubble. It's the kind of film that's perfect for the Imax format in which some theaters are offering it.  It ought to look good. The movie, by director Joseph Kosinski ((Tron: Legacy)), is said to be based on a graphic novel by Kosinski and comic book writer Arvid Nelson. Although that book was never published - and probably never will be - the mock-up of the story drew the attention of star Tom Cruise, along with not one, but two, studios. Disney, which originally had the rights, ultimately gave them up to Universal, which made the film.It's an engrossing, if complicated and twisty, story, with plentiful sci-fi action and a provocative subtext about the nature of the human soul. At times, however, the balance between those two things feels off. Some of the fight sequences, which involve robotic flying (drones) mounted with guns, go on a bit longer than is strictly necessary. Cruise plays Jack Harper, a futuristic maintenance man whose dangerous job consists of repairing the drones that patrol Earth, an unpopulated wasteland where giant (hydro rigs) convert seawater into energy to be used by what's left of the human race, which has relocated to a colony on one of Saturn's moons. Although we've won the war against the Scavs, there are still some left, and they like to sabotage the hydro rigs and the drones almost as much as they enjoy trying to kill Jack. More important, Jack starts to question his own identity; indeed, the very nature of identity itself. It's worth noting that, although Jack and Victoria underwent mandatory (memory wipes) that erased everything they knew before starting these jobs, Jack is plagued by strange dreams of a pre-war Earth - a time when he wouldn't even have been born - and of a beautiful but mysterious woman (Olga Kurylenko). The film's big reveal is satisfying but requires some mental effort. This is not a movie during which you should fall asleep. Fortunately, there's not much chance of that. (Oblivion) is fast-paced and exciting. As for the elephant in the room, it must be said that going to a Tom Cruise movie these days is more complicated than it used to be. The real-world baggage that this sometimes kooky tabloid staple brings to the screen is, for many, harder to ignore than it is with other movie stars, with the possible exception of Lindsay Lohan. That said, Cruise makes for a fine and even appealing action hero, perhaps because his character is someone without an apparent past. It's as if (Oblivion) is inviting us"
RTD_Doc7_Oblivion,RTD,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion,"Something's wrong. Tom Cruise, or, rather, Jack Harper, his character in the placid new science-fiction adventure ""Oblivion,"" can't shake his dreams of a woman giving him the big eyes on the observation deck of the Empire State Building. It's 2077. Earth has been devastated by a war with invading aliens. Most of the remaining populace has been relocated to a Saturn moon. Jack has recently undergone a ""mandatory memory wipe"" and now goes about his work, a couple of weeks prior to his own exit from Earth. He's a security guard and all-around Mr. Fix-It living and working high above what's left of Earth's surface in Tower 49 with his lover/colleague Victoria (Andrea Riseborough). A sort of ""Partial Recall,"" ""Oblivion"" gives you a lot to think about. And too much time to think about it. Wait a minute. You say I am having Total Recall of the Legend of the Planet of the Apes: A Space Odyssey? Then you're beginning to think exactly like a successful hack screenwriter. Watch a few movies (skip the nonfamous ones), scramble the bits together, dream up $200 million worth of effects, and you've got something you can (pitch) to execs who have seen exactly the same movies (and not many others). Both you and the execs are in full agreement that originality requires too much work. The script by Karl Gajdusek (an interesting playwright) and Michael DeBruyn, based on an unpublished graphic novel by the director, Joseph Kosinski (""Tron: Legacy""), weaves a tale involving governmental conspiracy, a revolutionary underground movement (Morgan Freeman plays the supercool head of the ""scavs,"" or scavengers) and various pro forma battle scenes that pit Cruise, in his spaceship or on his futuristic motorcycle, against a cadre of scowling, moon-faced mechanical flying drones, equipped with machine guns stolen from ""Attack of the Clones."" Jack knows something's up when his HAL-9000-styled boss, Sally (Melissa Leo, seen only on video monitors and oozing the sort of fake charm that spells trouble), orders him to stay away from a crash-landing site. Does Jack follow orders? No. He follows his instinct, and rescues the surviving member of the downed U.S. spaceship. She is the woman of his dreams, played by Kurylenko, and from there ""Oblivion"" springs a surprise or two. ""Surprise"" is a relative term. Kosinski's rhythm and visual style are pretty square for such a squirrelly script: Each grave, purposeful exchange of dialogue (some of it pretty thick in terms of expositional back story) is laid out very carefully, as if we're idiots. The movie's not bad for a while, but it's made of spare parts from a lot of other movies, among them ""Total Recall,"" ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" the ""2001"" riff ""Moon,"" a certain recent play by Caryl Churchill (can't say; spoiler) and a few others. What's interesting about it is its tight focus on a handful of characters. ""Oblivion"" is odder and less conventional than your average forgettable star vehicle; at times it feels like a five-character play taking place in a digital-effects lab."
RTD_Doc8_Oblivion,RTD,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"Do I smell the traces of test screenings? If not, then the makers of this beautiful, often exciting, ultimately empty sci-fi film have little confidence in their storytelling gifts. Oblivion begins with a lengthy voiceover (delivered to whom?) explaining, in absurd detail, the background to the latest cinematic apocalypse. If they are allowed to swell screen time with tedious exposition, then I am allowed to flesh out this review in the same way. It goes like this. At some point in the late 21st century, a horde of aliens descended upon the earth and launched an unholy war against its human occupants. Eventually, after launching a series of nuclear strikes, the homo sapiens triumphed, but the planet was left a virtual wasteland. The surviving citizens then retired to a vast, geometrically eccentric structure and began preparing for an exodus to the largest of Saturn's moons.  In the movie's present, poor Jack Harper (Tom Cruise), a former marine, is saddled with the task of repairing drones that prowl the planet seeking out rogue aliens. And it can't be denied that the opening sections are beautifully carried off. Jack lives in a futuristic pastiche of bourgeois domesticity that - one more reference if you'll allow - conjures up memories of the cartoon show The Jetsons . As Victoria, Jack's professional and romantic partner, poor Andrea Riseborough is asked to dress as if she's constantly on her way to the Oscars ceremony. Bad news, women: in the future, punishing high-heels will, it seems, be part of everyday work-wear again. As futurology it stinks. But as anaesthetised fantasy it works very nicely: the walls are all iPod white; the swimming pool sparkles beautifully; the view from the outside is ripped from a vintage science-fiction paperback cover. This life is so monotonously perfect you know it must be some sort of sham. Sure enough, one day Jack happens upon a downed spaceship, plucks a woman (spirited Olga Kurylenko) from the wreckage and brings her home to Happy Towers. The faÃ§ade begins to slip. At first, the interactions between Victoria and her new guest - hostility is much on display - point us towards a misogynistic reading of female relations. But, as further disturbing truths are revealed, it becomes clear that there are ancient reasons for the friction. Play close attention to the trailer and you will get some surprisingly explicit pointers towards the eventual twist. Not altogether mind-numbing, the reversal eventually propels us, as you knew it would, towards a great many shots of hurtling spacecraft. To be fair, Kosinki, working from his own unpublished graphic novel, uses the revelations to make sense of various nagging conundrums from the early part of the picture. It even manages to justify the perennial blandness of the apparently unaging Tom Cruise. That requires some class of genius. Still, nothing can quite excuse the hero's groaningly tedious notion of vernal paradise. Every now and then, Jack touches down by a lakeside shack to relax and thumb through a collection of rock-bore vinyl albums. Surely,"
RTD_Doc9_Oblivion,RTD,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"A sort of The Eternal Return played out in the ruins of a post-apocalyptic planet Earth, Joseph Kosinski's Oblivion is an absolutely gorgeous film dramatically caught between its aspirations for poetic romanticism and the demands of heavy sci-fi action. After a captivating beginning brimming with mystery and evident ambition, the air gradually seeps out of the balloon that keeps this thinly populated tale aloft, leaving the ultimate impression of a nice try that falls somewhat short of the mark. There's enough futuristic eye candy and battle scenes to lure the genre boys, while the presence of three important female characters, as well as Tom Cruise in good form, could attract more women than usual for this sort of fare, resulting in mostly robust, but not great, returns worldwide. The Universal release opens this week in most international territories, while the domestic bow comes April 19. To those who might wish to avoid a film by the maker of Tron: Legacy, it should be stressed that Oblivion is a more interesting work by a good distance, an imaginative speculative piece set some six decades hence that always engages serious attention, even if it doesn't convincingly jell. In mood, a certain delicacy and the sense of isolation both on a depopulated Earth and somewhere above it, the recent film that this most strongly recalls is WALL-E, except with violence and without the humor and charm of the Pixar classic. There have been many films set on an Earth depleted of humans, but few as visually enthralling as this one. Shot by Claudio Miranda of Life of Pi, Oblivion shares that film's lovely light, nuanced coloration and virtually seamless meshing of live photography and effects. In neither film is it always possible to be entirely sure of what is real and what's computer generated, but the result is beautiful however it breaks down. After what appear to be memory flashes of a previous life back in an early 21st century New York City on the part of Cruise's Jack Harper, he and his partner Vika (Andrea Riseborough) wake up in what can only take the prize as the ultimate loft space, circa 2077, a perch that's the last word in minimalist chic. It also affords unobstructed views of what's been left behind after the catastrophe that saw the moon blown into pieces, which in turn resulted in earthly ruin and a subsequent evacuation of survivors to Saturn's planet Titan. Revelations of what follows are best not detailed, except to say that Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, respectively, play the intelligent and impulsive members of a rebel band that soon captures Jack and Julia. As much as Jack aspires to recapture the past, however, and regardless of Julia's evident purity of intent, the renewed relationship doesn't click as intended, mostly because it's tough to buy the conceit of the couple reunited after so long. Technically, the film is a dream; if Tron: Legacy showed that Kosinski was right at home in an imaginary, effects-created world, then Oblivion reveals him"
RTD_Doc10_Oblivion,RTD,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"We don't get many idea-based science fiction films these days so, when one comes along, it represents a welcome change of pace from the fantasy space opera that has co-opted the genre. Despite being tarted up with enough action to stave off boredom for inattentive viewers, Oblivion is still more of a ""true"" sci-fi offering than 90% of what Hollywood passes off as such. It's not ""hard"" science fiction from the Asimov school but it feels more genuine than a lot of what tops box office tote boards. Assisting Jack is Vika (Andrea Riseborough) who monitors his activities and sends help. The two hope to emigrate the humans left on earth to Titan (Saturn's moon) for mankind to survive. However, random memory flashes of a woman (Olga Kurylenko) in pre-war New York leave Jack pondering his past. The visual effects work is first-rate. Most of this involves creating a post-cataclysmic New York and D.C., including such landmarks as the Empire State Building, the Pentagon, the Washington Monument, the Statue of Liberty, and the Brooklyn Bridge. Obviously, this isn't the first time we've seen this sort of thing - Planet of the Apes set the standard - but it's done as well here as anywhere else. The sound effects, including a throbbing score, are ""punched up"" enough to be memorable, although there are times when they call too much attention to themselves. This is the second directorial effort from Joseph Kosinski, who made his debut with the much-heralded TRON: Legacy. Here, he's working from a screenplay he co-wrote based on his own graphic novel, so he has to take blame for the film's failings, especially the narrative shortcomings and pacing problems. At the same time, he can claim credit for bringing to the screen a story that is intriguing enough to engage viewers who are interested in more from futuristic stories than explosions and space battles. Oblivion is not your video game-esque, fast-paced sci-fi action film which offers cheap thrills. It's a profound, cerebral drama which focuses on Jack's inner journey and his relentless search for identity. In spite of Joseph Kosinski's unhurried approach towards the film's buildup, he manages to keep you thoroughly engaged, thanks to brilliant production design and clever imagination. Spectacular images of planetary ruin, ravaged surfaces, barren landscapes, floating houses on the clouds, futuristic aircrafts, powerful drones and the strength of a complex restless mind, Oblivion manages to capture the beauty of it all with astounding reality. In terms of story-telling, the film stays unpredictable, thus convincing us to patiently wait as the mystery unfolds, even when it feels a tad directionless at times. Like a novel, the film stays unputdownable till the end. After Jack Reacher, 'I-want-to-be-versatile' Tom Cruise once again slips into a role which does not require his trademark charm or good looks and succeeds better this time as the role doesn't require him to be stoic either. Cruise displays the inner turmoil of his character brilliantly, in spite of not having any memorable dialogues at his disposal. Unfortunately, Morgan Freeman"
YWM_Doc1_Batman,YWM,Sci-Fi,Positive,Batman,"I always thought of Batman Returns as the ""dark"" movie of the first run of Batman films. Director Tim Burton's follow-up to what's now always called Batman '89. Burton's second Gotham film had Michael Keaton returning in a second go-around, facing off against a trio of villains the most memorable of which was Danny DeVito's Penguin. DeVito, beneath a heroic amount of makeup and prosthetics, played the famed villain as a tragic figure, out for revenge against Gotham, Batman, his parents, and the world at large.   For the third and fourth in that series of Batman movies, Burton (and Keaton) were jettisoned, in favor of director Joel Schumacher and Val Kilmer (and later George Clooney) as Batman, in movies that were much more colorful (and, in the eyes of most, less creatively successful.)   But compared to takes on Batman brought out in the subsequent years by the likes of Christopher Nolan, Zack Snyder, and Matt Reeves, Burton's version was practically sunshine and comedy.  Batman Returns arrived on June 19, 1992, 30 years ago this week. After Bruce Wayne and Batman did battle with The Joker in the first movie, there were three heavies in Batman Returns: The Penguin, The Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), and an evil businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken.) Shreck was a character without a comics pedigree, but he shared a name with the actor from the silent horror film Nosferatu; a movie about a decade later, Shadow of the Vampire, would posit that Schrek the actor was a vampire himself.   The plot of Batman Returns is somewhat convoluted, with the villains engaged in temporary alliances with one another, while Catwoman is out for revenge against Catwoman, his former secretary who pushed her out of a building before cats literally licked her back to life.   But what makes the film really go is DeVito as Penguin, a tragic villain who is given more depth than superhero movies typically gave their bad guys at the time. Danny Elfman's score, while similar to that of Batman '89, was another of the movie's big successes.   In the sort of thinkpiece that prefigured the discourse of decades later, the New York Times ran an op-ed shortly after the film's release called ""Batman and the Jewish Question."" In it, authors Rebecca Roiphe and Daniel Cooper found hints of anti-Semitism.   Penguin, the authors argued, ""is not just a deformed man, half human, half-Arctic-beast. He is a Jew, down to his hooked nose, pale face, and lust for herring."" They also noted that Shreck, a man with the same name as that famous screen vampire, was also coded as Jewish, while the film was loaded with Old Testament references, from Baby Oswald being put in a carriage like Moses, and the attempted slaying of the firstborn. The piece even compared Elfman's music for the film with that of Hitler's favorite composer, Wagner.  While arguing that they didn't believe the movie was itself anti-Semitic, the authors argued that the film ""repeatedly uses imagery and cultural stereotypes that are rooted"
YWM_Doc2_Batman,YWM,Sci-Fi,Positive,Batman,"At least, it's dark. The follow-up to the incredibly successful first Warner Bros.' Batman film is once again helmed by the master of the macabre, Tim Burton. ""Batman Returns"" reunites nearly the entire original cast, while the set designs/decorations, art direction, makeup, visual effects, cinematography, and the tone of the film perfectly mirror the previous Dark Knight outing. The story involves more villains and more action, but the characters themselves seemed to have lost their motivation to be anything more than mediocre. Still resolutely morbid, a little less serious, and certainly not as much fun, ""Batman Returns"" is nevertheless exponentially better than the next two installments in this flourishing motion picture franchise.  Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), one of the wealthiest businessmen in Gotham City, plans to build a new and unnecessary power plant for nefarious means. Only Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) stands in his way - along with Shreck's secretary, Selena Kyle (Michelle Pfieffer), who unwittingly peruses confidential files at the office. Intent on guarding his secrets, Max throws her out a window, failing to anticipate that Selena might survive the ghastly fall. Not completely insane, but driven by a knocked-loose alter ego that insists she become more like her constant stray cat companions, Kyle becomes Catwoman, a villainess bent on destroying her employer - and then the burdensome Batman.  Meanwhile, Shreck introduces the city to a revolting penguin-man, rumored to live in the sewers of Gotham. Claiming to desire only the truth about the parents who abandoned him years ago and the reason behind his miserable existence, Oswald Cobblepot (Danny DeVito), a hideously deformed human with a penchant for umbrellas and a strange control over armies of sewer penguins, warms up to the public's hearts - and soon runs for mayor. Using a strong sympathy vote devised with the help of Shreck, the ""Penguin"" eventually teams with Catwoman to frame Batman, who continually gets in the way of their goals to destroy Gotham City. It's up to Batman to protect the frightened townsfolk from the Penguin's army of machinegun-toting clowns (quite Joker-esque) and from utter annihilation at the hands of the two new, mentally unbalanced antagonists.  The familiar theme song by Danny Elfman, gothic opera music, and glisteningly black sets reappear in this second Batman feature - and the last one of the '90s that spends time on the origins of the villains. ""Batman Returns"" certainly proves that a hero is only as good as the villain - both Catwoman and the Penguin are unique, formidable, brilliantly costumed, and perfectly ghoulish; however, their motives and dialogue frequently disrupt the acceptable unnaturalness of their geneses and appearances. Realism is not a strong point with any of the Batman films, but Catwoman's unexpected martial arts skills and her mastery of a whip and the Penguin's influence over flightless aquatic birds (apparently, one of their natural habitats is the sewer) reminds audiences just how comic book-based this episode really is. Each character could have used a much larger dose of sinisterness. But even the personas"
YWM_Doc3_Batman,YWM,Sci-Fi,Positive,Batman,"Some superhero movie sequels are terrible (Thor: The Dark World, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer), while others are not only better than their predecessors, but so good that they deserve to be hailed as masterpieces (Spider-Man 2, Captain America: The Winter Soldier). Tim Burton's Batman Returns quite easily falls into the latter category, and is without a shadow of a doubt a contender for the best Batman movie. That's undoubtedly high praise when you think back to 2008's The Dark Knight, but Catwoman's twisted origin story and subsequent descent into madness are every bit as compelling as what we saw from Heath Ledger's Joker.  Michelle Pfeiffer's performance is as good as Ledger's, and while Selina Kyle's origin story is...strange...there's no denying that her story arc is both memorable and original. Dealing with a complete mental breakdown, the secretary's (sorry, executive assistant) Catwoman transformation is extremely fun to follow, while her duelling nature as she looks to teach the abusive men around her a lesson (a theme which feels particularly relevant watching the movie today) leads to a lot of gripping twists and turns. Neither a villain nor a hero, she operates somewhere in between, and that makes her budding relationships with both Bruce Wayne and Batman all the more enjoyable.   Talking of the Caped Crusader, Michael Keaton really finds his footing as both sides of the character in Batman Returns and it's a crying shame he never got a chance to reprise the role for a direct sequel (thank God for The Flash, eh?). Adding even more personality to the eccentric billionaire while clearly having a great deal of fun as Batman, this Dark Knight remains a divisive figure - he grins after blowing one goon up - but Keaton still cements himself as the best big screen Batman here. While the villain doesn't quite steal the spotlight from him this time around, Danny DeVito's Penguin is still incredible. Despite being another character with a bizarre origin story, that actually ends up working really well, and his rise and fall is an arc which often takes centre stage and works better than what we saw from The Joker in Batman. The actor's   Just like Keaton is clearly extremely comfortable in Batman's cape and cowl this time around, Burton also appears to have become a far more confident filmmaker with this sequel. He makes a number of fascinating choices, both visually (Penguin's grotesque appearance is a sight to behold, while it's not at all hard to see why Catwoman's costume is now iconic) and with the story. One moment which stands out comes during a masquerade ball where the only people not wearing a mask are Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle as they wrestle with their alter-egos and the implications they have on their lives. A solitary Bruce being lit up by the Bat-Signal in Wayne Manor emphasises his loneliness before he crosses paths with Selina for the first time, and the Gotham City Burton has created is as unique"
YWM_Doc4_Batman,YWM,Sci-Fi,Positive,Batman,"It's important to note that Burton's Batman was a game-changer, led by a captivating performance from Jack Nicholson as the Joker. However, there were still elements of Burton's unique style that had to be tempered in order for Batman to be palatable to mainstream audiences. With the success of the first film, Burton returned to the director's chair under the condition that he be given much more creative control with the sequel. The studio agreed and Burton was allowed to apply his artistic flourishes with the biggest brushes available.  Burton has always taken inspiration from German Expressionism and Batman Returns is his best use of the form. Gotham City was grimy and Art Deco before, but Batman Returns takes it into a nightmarish territory. Giant stone-faced statues and sharp shadows drape the crime-ridden burg. It's like a living, breathing Underworld brought to life. Modern superhero movies are so focused on being grounded in a reality that we recognize. Today, the unabashed surrealism of Batman Returns' Gotham City is refreshingly unreal.  Batman Returns also has a brilliant approach to its three main characters: explore the primal, animal-inspired facets of these larger-than-life icons of comic book history. Burton takes horror imagery - a clear inspiration for the original iteration of the Caped Crusader - and amplifies it to the nth degree.  The Penguin is a straight up monster, oozing black goo out of his mouth and kidnapping children with the intent of drowning them. Yet, there is still a pity to him like all classic monsters. Catwoman is every Puritan's worst dream come true: a powerfully sexual woman who embraces her femininity so fiercely that it's downright scary (and undeniably seductive). Even Batman delves deeper into his own dark side, being labeled as a monster thanks to a clever setup from his two foes. His battle with duality is explored in a fairy tale fashion that the first Batman didn't really have time to properly analyze.  You also get the inimitable Christopher Walken as the slimy corporate sleazebag Max Shreck (in case Burton's love of German Expressionism wasn't clear). Walken is as delightful as you expect him to be. He plays the role like an evil Bruce Wayne and there are definitely similarities to other real-life corporate moguls of the time, including Donald Trump. Shreck even says, ""You're fired!"" in an eerily identical fashion.  Each of these characters gets a compelling and tragic arc that plays out in operatic fashion. It's praise all around, but one of them definitely steals the show...  Get ready for the boldest statement of this argument so far: Pfeiffer's Catwoman is a better villain than Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight. Yes, Ledger's performance as the Clown Prince of Crime is fantastic. But, at the writing level, his character is as one-note as you get. Granted, that one note is played flawlessly but there isn't any emotional complexity to the character.  Pfeiffer's Catwoman is a multi-layered figure. She's sympathetic, scary, badass, conflicted, empowered, sensual, lovable, ferocious, and all-around entrancing to watch on screen."
YWM_Doc5_Batman,YWM,Sci-Fi,Positive,Batman,"I'm a bit of a DC geek, with my first exposure to the comics being in the corners of my local public library. You see, with comics, I didn't have to worry as much about getting overwhelmed by sounds or bright, fast sequences playing out on screen. No, I could see them all play out on the page and start theorizing about what would happen next to some of my favorite characters. I did this a lot when it came to the BATMAN comics. I didn't quite understand as a child why it was such an issue for a man to hide his identity. Why couldn't he just own up to this side of himself that lurked within? As I'd come to realize as I got older, this duality would be the crux of interest for many creators and fans when it came to the caped crusader. While many have tried to capture the argument and conflict of his duality, the recent films have either taken the subject of his duality too seriously or they've completely neglected that internal struggle altogether. However, I was reminded of one movie that seemed to really do it for me. None have captured the feeling of Bruce Wayne's duality more, in my opinion, than Tim Burton's BATMAN RETURNS.  The film starts with an opening sequence which sets up the origin story for one of the main villains of the film, Oswald Cobblepot aka the Penguin (Danny DeVito). We see the young child abandoned to live in the sewers after his parents find him to be too much of a handful (it is implied that the boy has severe homicidal tendencies via a poor kitty encounter). We then jump ahead about 30 or so years to present-day Gotham City where the obviously, no-good ambitious businessman Max Shreck (played by an ever terrifying Christopher Walken) is hoping to expand his business by any means necessary. However, this opens him up to blackmail to the Penguin, who arranges early on in the film by his goons to successfully kidnap the businessman. The Penguin gives Shreck a proposal he can't refuse. If he helps the Penguin become mayor of Gotham City, he will help Shreck get what he wants in the end.  However, there are two obstacles that get in Shreck's way. There is Batman (played by Michael Keaton once more) who will do nothing to stop evil from taking over the city. And, there is Shreck's assistant, Selena Kyle (played by the lovely Michelle Pfeiffer), who accidentally discovers that the businessman's plans for the city are not beneficial to anyone except for himself. This prompts him to try to kill her but, in an amazing cat lady sequence pulled directly from my dreams, Selena is revived and soon transforms into the dangerous, beguiling Catwoman. She eventually teams up with the Penguin to destroy Batman, but soon finds herself falling for both Batman and Bruce Wayne. Needless to say, calamity ensues.  While Tim Burton's BATMAN toyed around with that middle grey"
YWM_Doc6_Batman,YWM,Sci-Fi,Negative,Batman,"Batman Returns is a good film only in the sense that the Royal Mint is a good mint: it is making money with great effi- ciency. The first record-breaking weekend can be seen as a tribute to its publicity machine and its predecessor, but the suc- cess continues. Also impressive is young Tim Burton's ability to make huge Holly- wood films that remain recognisably his. Beetlejuice, the two Batmen and Edward Scissorhands are each in part melancholy, faintly macabre fantasies. These two quali- ties are the more remarkable combined, in that you might feel that anyone could spend money on vast sets in varying shades through grey to black and hire excellent actors to look morose in unusual costumes, but, in the age of feel-good movies, he has enticed huge numbers in to enjoy his gloomy vision. But not me.  The stars are not seen to best advantage. Michael Keaton, timid and uncharismatic as Bruce Wayne, remains timid and uncharismatic as Batman, presumably by design. He is sad and lonely in his Gothic mansion with (still no Robin) only his but- ler, played by Michael Gough, in a return to the tradition of casting the British as butlers, where recently they had made it to villains. There are three of these and it is a crowd: Christopher Walken, a polluting tycoon, somehow sucks electricity out of things and intones, 'You can never have too much power'; Danny DeVito as the Penguin, brilliantly sinister when first glimpsed scuttling plumply and top-hatted along the sewers, becomes increasingly tedious in spite of energetic bird-noises; and Michelle Pfeiffer, a male sex fantasy with black leather and whip when Catwom- an, but much more appealing, indeed for me the best thing in the film because she lightens the mood, as a scatty secretary who returns to her apartment with the words, 'Honey, I'm home. Oh, I forgot, I'm not married.'  No one has bothered about the plot. The Penguin does not want to rule the world, just to become mayor of Gotham City, and this leads to incomprehensible confronta- tions between the stars. Pfeiffer has a neon sign, 'Hello There', which seemed mildly odd until, having been pushed out of a win- dow by Walken and slightly eaten by stray cats, she trashes her things, removing the 0 and the T to make 'Hell Here' - quite neat and not laboured, but mysterious. DeVito asks, 'Who am I?' plaintively and Keaton decides, 'There is a split in all of us', but these thoughts do not make a mild- ly depressing film deep, just as routine car chases and explosions do not make a mildly dull film exciting.  Far more interesting is The Rapture, which is the first film directed by Michael Tolkin, who wrote the scintillating The Player. It is precisely the sort of film no player would make. We are shown a woman almost literally in a box, repeating the same words over and over: a telephone operator. Then we see her with a man who has"
YWM_Doc7_Batman,YWM,Sci-Fi,Negative,Batman,"There's no two ways about it. Tim Burton is a gifted and inventive director. Edward Scissorhands proved that. But neither Batman nor Batman Returns adds much to the evidence. They are just hits, missing their true mark by something like a mile, buried by extravagance and covered in hype. If Batman seemed to be a constant tug of war between what Burton wanted to do and what his producers, Peter Guber and Jon Peters, demanded for commercial success, the second film, without the overweening if watchable presence of Jack Nicholson as the Joker, has more vision but less coherence. It looks like a gigantic fairy tale without a real centre for the imagination to catch upon. To be frank, it's often kind of dull.  This Gotham City is certainly darkly lit and shot as if determined to make its art deco settings almost but not quite Dickensian, a contradiction in terms which wouldn't matter if everything else was in place. Its detail is as elaborate as that of Anton Furst, the British designer whose death prevented him working on it and who provided the one true pleasure of the first film.  But the cinematography rarely takes flight (there's a difference between something looking good and being used effectively) and the comic strip characters remain obstinately uninvolving, moving through a plot that's confused enough to prevent any of them achieving more than momentary prominence.  If Nicholson stood too long leering at us in the spotlight, Danny DeVito's screeching Penguin, unrecognisable in his flubbery outfit and virtual face mask, is a villain with one acting hand tied around his back, pitched against a curiously lacklustre Batman , now played by Michael Keaton with robot-like disengagement.  It is left largely to Michelle Pfeiffer 's leathered-up Catwoman, the mousy secretary who turns into a Jekyll and Hyde vixen ('I am Catwoman. Hear me roar!'), and Christopher Walken as Max Shreck, the rapacious industrialist who thought he had dispensed with her services through the window of a skyscraper, to distract our wandering attention. Even they have a hard job getting out from under the scenery and the toy-oriented special effects.  Batman Returns resembles nothing so much as a blacker, spikier but less focused version of a Disney animation feature made flesh. No great surprise, perhaps, since Burton worked at that dream factory once. It's two hours and a bit of movie-making that looks as if it's been worked half to death. Better, perhaps, than the prosaically over-orchestrated Hook but unable to sustain the 'liberation from plot into poetry' its supporters claim. Phantasmagoria has to be more magical than this, and possibly less mechanically oriented.  That said, one can see what Burton was striving for. The Penguin is the key - a stunted troll pushed into the sewer by his disgruntled parents who doesn't know whether he is a human being or an animal, but wants Gotham City's respect just the same.  He hates Catwoman, regards Shreck as a plastic villain, Batman as the trust fund goody-goody - as Shreck terms him - and"
YWM_Doc8_Batman,YWM,Sci-Fi,Negative,Batman,"A wild kingdom of half-man half-beasts populates wintry, moldering Gotham in ""Batman Returns,"" a bleakly visionary but dramatically obtuse encore for the Dark Knight and his fellow freaks. An architectural and anthropomorphic psychodrama, the sequel is a bulky amalgam of Stupid Pet Tricks, Visigothic Disney World and ""I Never Promised You a Rose Garden."" Like its lethargic forebear, it suffers from director Tim Burton's basic indifference to what becomes of his characters after he's drawn them. Working from a screenplay by the equally dire Daniel Waters, who wrote ""Heathers"" and ""Hudson Hawk,"" Burton aims for a lighter, brighter, sexier sequel. But the mood is so suffocatingly somber it might have been shot in the belly of an architect -- probably the one who built the movie's fabulously fascistic Gotham Plaza. A grand parody of Rockefeller Square, it represents the city's hegemony over its citizens, who have gathered for the annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony when the action begins: A cadre of the Penguin's macabre harlequins attacks, and Bruce ""Batman"" Wayne (Michael Keaton) is summoned by Batsign.  This installment of the Batman epic concerns the ""difficulty with duality,"" as the hero puts it to the scratchy, licky Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), his sinuous new love-hate interest. The secretary of evil polluter Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) by day, Selina ""Catwoman"" Kyle takes on a dual personality when she is raised from the dead by cats. The Penguin (Danny DeVito) hopes to ally with her in his battle for dominance over Batman.  All damaged children in disguise (none of them heroic), the dysfunctional half-menagerie can't help but understand one another. Indeed Batman, who was orphaned, and Penguin, who was abandoned, are virtually birds of a feather -- which makes for an interesting relationship that Keaton explores with subtlety. But Burton as usual is focused on his most maniacal character, Oscar ""The Penguin"" Cobblepot, a deformed sewer-dweller who was raised by zoo penguins after his parents tossed him off Gotham's equivalent of the Tallahatchee Bridge. As Christmas approaches, he emerges from his underground kingdom claiming to search for his parents when he is really intent on leveling Gotham and grounding Batman.  Meanwhile, Catwoman, a victim of corporate evil and sexual oppression, slinks deliciously on the scene. Though predominantly occupied with fighting sex crimes, she starts to get in the way of Batman's heroics. A mousy sort before her brain was damaged in a fall, she equips herself with a bullwhip and a homemade, black vinyl suit, proclaiming: ""I am Catwoman, hear me roar.""  Pfeiffer alone brings human vulnerabilities to her role. It's no wonder she is catnip to Batman. He and Catwoman share a Mapplethorpe moment when she whips the rubber-suited one into submission and his bat toes curl. However, like so many other promising relationships, it's never as fully developed as production designer Bo Welsh's eye-popping sets and Michael Fink's phantasmagoric effects. If only Burton had taken as much care sculpting his scenes.  Like a hyperactive 11-year-old, the director seems both uncomfortable with adult emotions and unable to focus on"
YWM_Doc9_Batman,YWM,Sci-Fi,Negative,Batman,"The gloomy undertone of the Batman movies is like a tow line, holding the movie back, keeping it from springing free into the wind.  Tim Burton's ""Batman Returns,"" even more than the original ""Batman,"" is a dark, brooding film, filled with hurt and fear, childhood wounds and festering adult resentments. It is also a most intriguing movie, great to look at, fun to talk about. There is no doubt Burton is a gifted director, but is he the right director for Batman? The film opens in cruelty and shame, as the parents of a deformed baby put him into his bassinet and drop him into the river on a cold, snowy Christmas night. The frail little craft floats downstream and into the sewers of Gotham City, where the infant is rescued and raised by the penguins who luckily happen to live there.  Arriving at adulthood, his hands like lobster claws, the Penguin (Danny DeVito) learns about the human world by peering out through sewer gratings. His soul burns with the need to discover who his parents were, and why they treated him so meanly.  Elsewhere in Gotham, the mayor (Michael Murphy) presides over the municipal Christmas tree lighting before cold crowds under sullen skies. He is joined by the vile tycoon Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), who has a scheme to build a power plant that will drain the city of its energy. His browbeaten secretary (Michelle Pfeiffer), killed after she discovers the scheme, is licked back to life by alley cats and vows vengeance, sewing herself a skintight, fetishistic costume and venturing out into the night as Catwoman.  Meanwhile, in the bat cave beneath his gloomy mansion, Batman (Michael Keaton) ponders whatever deep needs led to his own peculiar existence.  Even back in the days when Batman lived in comic books, his world was a little darker than, say, Superman's. There was a shade of film noir in Gotham City, in contrast to the deco 1930s optimism of Superman's Metropolis. The Dark Knight, a graphic novel that inspired the Batman movies, was darker still, and now Burton takes it all the way - into a movie set mostly at night, photographed on refrigerated sets, so that the actors sometimes look as if they would rather have a mug of hot chocolate than all the passion and wealth in the city.  The plot doesn't exactly unwind like a well-coiled machine. The movie proceeds in fits and starts, from one little drama to another, as the Penguin ventures out from his subterranean haunts, and a newspaper circulation war leads to scare stories about his alleged crimes.  The evil Max Shreck meanwhile directs his henchmen in a conspiracy to deliver Gotham into his own megalomaniac hands, and Murphy, as the incumbent mayor, blathers like an ineffectual nonentity while the Penguin mounts a campaign against him.

With Batman/Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) preparing to defend the city from this latest invasion of chaos, another spoiler arrives in the form of Selina Kyle/Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), a splintered secretary-turned-superhero out to kill Shreck and any man who stands in her way.  1992: After the voracious excitement surrounding the 1989 release of ""Batman"" paid off with a marvelous film (covered a little more in-depth here), monster box office, and a universal discharge of geekery, plans for a sequel quickly commenced, generating tremendous anticipation from squirrely movie fanatics looking to secure a second high of omnipresent caped crusader hype.  It was a brutal three-year wait for ""Batman Returns,"" which strolled back into view with a curious marketing campaign that emphasized the introduction of two supervillains and a gloomier world of tortured heroism for Batman. ""The Bat, The Cat, The Penguin"" was an odd tagline, yet conveyed the upcoming experience with a fascinating, semi-cheeky minimalism, promising fans a triple threat extravaganza for their premiere summer entertainment, also revealing a winter-thwacked bat symbol on the poster, foreshadowing a tonal chill about the picture that everyone ignored.  I attended the midnight opening of the feature, refusing to wait a single simple sleep to Dyson up Batman's next screen adventure. The place was packed with excited young men (and a few women), some breaking out in impromptu Joker impressions to keep the rest of us sufficiently lathered up during the preshow. The crowd was just about ready to pop when the lights went down, greeting the Warner Brothers shield and the opening titles with cheers and applause. Batman was back. Finally.  And then the cheering stopped.     Eerily similar to my first ""Alien 3"" viewing experience, ""Batman Returns"" was met with stunned silence from an audience clearly expecting the arrival of the prickly but accessible comic book ambiance of the original picture. No one anticipated such a brooding, angry sequel, with grotesque characters galore and a weird fixation on dark comedy that was seldom funny. I personally felt deflated by the feature, overwhelmed with its fanged approach. It was like being sucker-punched by Tim Burton, who seized the sequel opportunity to make a mess out of his original creation, taking his newfound creative freedom to an extreme few were fully prepared to receive.  Despite my unsettled wooziness as I exited the theater, I somehow kept an upbeat attitude about the movie, rating it positively in the Brichives, yet still conveying an overall disappointment with the feature, finding the black-eyed gloom overbearing, the villains too easily dispatched, and disliking how Batman was reduced to a mere cameo in his own film. It wasn't glowing praise, yet I dearly wanted to love the feature, to keep the tingly Batmania trucking along. Over the next few years, my overall opinion of the movie dropped considerably,"
TWH_Doc1_PitchBlack,TWH,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pitch Black,"Packed with razzle-dazzle special effects and fueled with aggressive, hyperactive cinematography and a pulse-pounding narrative that never lets the tension subside until the final frame, ""Pitch Black"" is the movie of the season for sci-fi and horror fans. I'm not going to try to convince you that this tale of a group of space-crash survivors facing unknown danger on a mysterious planet is a greatly original work. Although it's the splashiest cutting-edge effects picture since ""The Matrix,"" it lacks that work's epic, synthetic sweep. But if your taste runs to that flavor of eye candy, ""Pitch Black"" will rock you. It's a tightly constructed genre picture, combining the best paranoid thrills of the ""Alien"" series with the setting of ""Mad Max"" and the anti-Utopian future of ""Blade Runner."" This is apparently Vin Diesel's big week. In this film, playing Riddick, a sinister, laconic convict with hidden depth, he looks like the first new action star of the 2000s. Meanwhile, in the next chamber of the multiplex, you can see him as a youthful stock-trading shark in the ensemble drama ""Boiler Room."" (Previously, Diesel had a small role in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and was the voice of ""The Iron Giant."") Riddick is a muscular badass, a multiple murderer who apparently shaves his head with axle grease. ""Human blood has a coppery taste,"" he tells Johns (Cole Hauser), the bounty hunter entrusted with taking Riddick back to prison. ""If you cut it with peppermint schnapps it goes away."" But the wiseguy dialogue doesn't conceal a certain soulful intelligence, even sadness, in Riddick. He's a real cool killer whose still waters run deep, not just another snarky asshole in the Schwarzenegger mold. When a Muslim cleric (Keith David) among the castaways accuses him of lacking faith, Riddick avers, ""I absolutely believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker."" Johns, Riddick, the imam, spacecraft captain Caroline Fry (Radha Mitchell) and a motley handful of other renegades are the only survivors of a crash-landing on an unknown desert planet, where the combination of three suns means that night never falls. The crash sequence itself, which opens ""Pitch Black,"" is an electrifying thrill ride of chaotic digital animation and distorted photography, which lets you know right away that director David Twohy, cinematographer David Eggby and their collaborators are planning to kick out the jams. While struggling to find water and food on this harsh, apparently uninhabited sphere -- rendered by Eggby (who was, in fact, the cinematographer on ""Mad Max"") in harsh, surreal yellows and blues -- the gang makes a number of unhappy discoveries. There were humans, probably a team of geologists, living on the planet at one time, but something bad happened to them exactly 22 years earlier. The thing that happened was a total eclipse, leaving the planet in darkness and summoning something -- actually, very many, very hungry somethings -- from beneath the surface. The rest of ""Pitch Black"" follows the familiar pattern of a desert-island or haunted-house movie, as our plucky band, trapped in the darkness with their batteries and fuel supply rapidly fading, feud among themselves as they're picked off one at a time.

TWH_Doc2_PitchBlack,TWH,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pitch Black,"It's Vin Diesel week! Suddenly, this largely unknown actor, whose only significant credits were a part in Saving Private Ryan and some voice work in The Iron Giant (as the title character), is a hot commodity with significant roles in two films opening the same day. Diesel fans are strongly advised to see both Boiler Room and Pitch Black, as they show different aspects of the actor's range. In Boiler Room, he's a regular guy working a regular job. In Pitch Black, he goes into full Arnold Schwarzenegger mode, flexing his muscles, grunting, and uttering the occasional one liner. It's not an especially challenging part, but Diesel handles it with aplomb.  Pitch Black can be viewed as a slick, stylish version of the kind of outer space creature feature that is typified best by the Alien movies. At its best (which is quite often), Pitch Black is an entertaining effort. On the down side, there are times when various largely anonymous characters wander around in the dark and do incredibly stupid things while being stalked by vicious alien creatures. As they get picked off one-by-one, the only question is who's going to be next.  The last time writer/director David Twohy wandered into the science fiction arena, the result was the surprisingly intelligent and involving The Arrival, about an alien infestation on Earth. For most of Pitch Black, Twohy has brought the same level of thoughtfulness to this screenplay. The initial half-hour, which details the crash-landing of a spaceship on a barren desert planet, is particularly good. Once the first alien makes its appearance, things become routine from a storyline perspective, but the level of suspense escalates. To fill in the dead spots between alien attacks, we are treated to a series of recycled interpersonal conflicts. And, for those who are bothered by such things, the film's so-called ""science"" employs a few key violations of the laws of physics.  The movie begins with the crash, a violent concussion that leaves most of the crew and passengers dead. Among the handful of survivors are Fry (Radha Mitchell), the pilot; Johns (Cole Hauser), a police officer; Riddick (Diesel), a convicted murderer who is being transported in chains; and Inam, a holy man (Keith David). The planet is an apparently lifeless wasteland - a desertscape where three suns assure that there is no night and possibly no water. Shortly after the rough landing, Riddick escapes, but, while the survivors are looking for him, they too are being hunted - by a species of alien that shuns the daylight but is lethal in the dark. Soon, with the realization that the world is about to be plunged into blackness by an inconvenient total eclipse, everyone must learn to trust Riddick, who can see in the dark, if they are to survive. Meanwhile, it's unclear whether Riddick's primary goal is self-preservation or redemption.  The acting is solid, if largely unremarkable.

TWH_Doc3_PitchBlack,TWH,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pitch Black,"Practitioner of guilty pleasure B-movies-such as 1996's underrated alien invasion yarn The Arrival-director David Twohy made Pitch Black in 2000, and it has since earned a cult following. The last film produced by PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, the production was completed for $23 million, and it more than doubled its returns at the worldwide box office. Its modest performance nonetheless announced the arrival of Vin Diesel's action hero stardom; before this and Boiler Room (released on the same day as Pitch Black), Diesel's notable credits consisted of only a small supporting role in Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan (1998) and voicework on Brad Bird's animated gem The Iron Giant (1999). Twohy's movie didn't make Diesel a household name, but it's something both he and his fans have returned to over the years. Many discovered Pitch Black on home video, while Diesel later teamed with Twohy to continue the adventures of the movie's anti-hero, Riddick.  Jim and Ken Wheat wrote the screenplay along with Twohy, and the result derives influence from every notable sci-fi classic of the last fifty years. The movie opens with a spacecraft moving steadily through the blackness of space, recalling those iconic shots from Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and later Star Wars (1977). Space debris penetrates the hull, and the craft begins to descend into the atmosphere of a nearby planet. With the captain killed in the chaos, pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) considers jettisoning some forty passengers in cryo-sleep so she might survive. She doesn't, and in the ensuing crash, less than a dozen make it. Among the survivors are the Muslim Imam (Keith David), the would-be cop Johns (Cole Hauser), a boy named Jack (Rhiana Griffith), the antiquities dealer Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald), and a detained killer named Richard B. Riddick (Diesel).  Stranded on a desert planet that has three suns and perpetual sunlight, the survivors pool their resources and head out into the surrounding nothingness to search for water. But the search becomes secondary after the escape of Riddick, a killer whose murderous ways are confirmed by Johns and never denied in Riddick's monosyllabic retorts. Still, we know he's the hero because he's the one narrating. He's eventually caught after one of the survivors mysteriously dies, although he insists he's not responsible. ""All you people are so scared of me."" Diesel's character rumbles. ""Most days, I'd take that as a compliment. But it ain't me you gotta worry about now."" Indeed, traveling with Riddick as their captive, they come upon a leftover science camp in which they find no signs of human life-but they do find large, carnivorous, nocturnal batlike creatures that remain hidden in a web of underground tunnels. Worse, as the camp's former geologists learned, they're about to witness a planetary eclipse that only occurs every 22 years and lasts nearly a month, meaning the dark-dwelling creatures can finally emerge from their slumber to feed.

He's the only prisoner of the group, which prompts him to contemplate the many opportunities for escape that may present themselves over the course of the 41-week journey. When a meteor shower causes excessive damage, causing the crew to be automatically awoken prematurely, Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) inherits a command position after learning that Captain Tom Mitchell has perished. And then a tumultuous crash-landing plunges them all into darkness.  With the back half of the ship torn away, it's obvious that the desert planet (boasting three suns) on which they stumbled will be their new home for some time. William Johns (Cole Hauser) is in charge of Riddick, who poses a conundrum, as he'd previously broken out of a maximum-security prison. Blindfolded and gagged, Riddick is additionally chained to a beam; but it's not enough to hold the man forever. A handful of survivors scour the wreckage, gather usable supplies, and hope to locate water - but they have more pressing things to worry about as well, such as the ravenous indigenous life.  The sets are instantly amusing, though they're obscured by a precise color scheme that turns the imagery black-and-white with hints of various tints. Shadowy locales are bluish, while sun-scorched sand dunes are yellow; other colors are virtually nonexistent. If it didn't feel as if utilized to hide mediocre special effects, the palette might have been more effective. Distorted images, slow-motion in unnecessary moments, repeated camera angles, and rapid cuts also generate visual curiosities, which numb the effectiveness of the cinematography and action-oriented violence. Nevertheless, the exploration of the planet holds additional intrigue, particularly as the unprepared passengers investigate abandoned outposts and encounter other inhabitants.  ""All you people are so scared of me. Most days I take that as a compliment. But it ain't me you gotta worry about now."" ""Pitch Black"" isn't smart sci-fi; instead, it's boilerplate survival horror, preoccupied with death, destruction, and monsters. Likewise, it's the type of thriller that employs a muscular hero and capable female sidekicks with obligatorily bared midriffs. There's also a curious subplot about idolizing Riddick's notoriety, with two teenaged survivors emulating his dress and demeanor - which doesn't quite fit with the rest of the action. Fortunately, this leads to a couple of surprises (chiefly in the order of demises), which proves a certain level of storytelling bravery from writer/director David Twohy.  The dependence on CG antagonists, however, is a pity, as they doesn't hold up nearly as well as practical models (plus, inconsistencies abound with the designs, principally when the aliens swarm in the millions yet attack in small groups, perhaps a dozen at a time). This is true of the bloodshed, too, whose creativity suffers from unconvincing executions. The suspense fares better, especially when the characters are hunted down one by one in the inky confines of spaceship corridors or underground tunnels"
TWH_Doc5_PitchBlack,TWH,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pitch Black,"Science fiction is often described as ""a genre of ideas"". Science fiction films, on the other hand, speak against this definition. Ideas behind those films are often not particularly original or in any connection with common sense. It is in the way they are presented that make for the quality in science fiction films. PITCH BLACK, 2000 science fiction written and directed by David Twohy, is good example.   The plot is set in distant future when a passenger space ship gets hit by meteorites and makes emergency landing on the surface of an unknown desert planet with three suns in the sky. Only a handful of people have survived the crash and Fry (played by Radha Mitchell), pilot who volunteers to become group's leader, has to deal with two problems - lack of water and Riddick (played by Vin Diesel), convicted murderer who was being taken to prison by his guard Johns (played by Cole Hauser) and who took the crash as an opportunity for escape. While Johns tries to talk other survivors in tracking him down, Fry discovers apparently abandoned human colony with conspicuously preserved space ship that could fly after minimal repair. Fry and others will soon discover the reason why there aren't any colonists - a total eclipse, which happens every 22 years, leaves the planet in complete darkness and brings some forms of the local fauna from the underground. The creatures can't stand the light but the darkness allows them brief opportunity to enjoy some exotic food on the surface.   After its premiere PITCH BLACK was hailed as the new ALIEN, a SF horror classic in the same category with Ridley Scott's masterpiece. Although such praise wasn't justified, PITCH BLACK deserves to be recommended as a solid piece of genre entertainment. Twohy managed to overcome relatively low budget with ingenuity and good use of Australian locations. But the most important factor is human - Twohy learned a lot from Scott's film. The script allows audience to start caring for the characters and action scenes even allow for some minor glimpses into future world, which is in a way distant reflection of our own, with all of gender, race, religious, social and other differences. There are some interesting plot twists and many characters aren't what they are supposed to be. The acting is, of course, very good. Vin Diesel is very effective in almost iconic role of a ""cool"" but lovable rouge, while Radha Mitchell does nice job as Ripley-like pilot. Keith David, however, steals the show in the role of Muslim pilgrim.   The major problem for PITCH BLACK is in this science fiction film, like so many recent Hollywood examples of the genre, not taking ""science"" very seriously. Too many elements of the plot are too convenient to bear serious scrutiny. Most of them deal with the bizarre ecology of the planet that is hard to reconcile with fauna described in the film.

Pitch Black, however, offers precious few twists on its timeworn storyline. Mankind's innate fear of the night is at the heart of Pitch Black: It's Wait Until Dark in space, with the razor-blades-and-scotch vowels of Vin Diesel fronting for Audrey Hepburn, and several thousand omnivorous proto-swallows nicely filling Alan Arkin's shoes. It's also more than a tad reminiscent of James Cameron's Aliens and perhaps even Jurassic Park -- but this last is meant in a good way. (The film wears its homages on its sleeve like a badge of honor.) Most of the time, the film coasts by on dollops of gore and weak suspense, but it's impersonal to the point of being almost existential, which makes the whole thing adrenally invigorating, sort of like a closed MRI with scary pictures taped two inches above your eyes. The film opens with everyone's hyper-sleep being rudely disturbed as a space transport ship carrying 40 passengers is knocked off course by the tail of a wayward comet. Docking Pilot Fry (Mitchell, of High Art) manages to land the ship on an desert planet that features three suns which cause permanent daylight. The survivors include bounty hunter Johns (Hauser) and his murderous prisoner Riddick (Diesel), who is chained, blindfolded, and has a bit in his mouth. A trio of others, including a young stowaway, make up the rest of the landing party, and while the first business at hand is to find water, there's also the disturbing matter of what, exactly, killed all the giant creature skeletons that litter the dusty landscape. As it happens, the bone-owners were stripped of their epidermals by a subterranean, nocturnal species that resembles more than anything flying hammerhead sharks crossed with spiders, and as the planet enters a total solar eclipse, guess who's coming to dinner? That's the setup and things follow more or less predictably from there to the film's resolution. Much of the fun in Twohy's film (and it is fun) comes from his clever use of sound; for a film that takes place in so much darkness, Twohy wisely teamed with Lucas Digital Ltd., Inc. to provide the myriad howlings and hootings of the planet's native species (as well as some well-done opening disaster shots), and the enhanced audio makes a world of difference. Twohy and cinematographer David Eggby (Mad Max) also make the most of some interesting film stock choices, going for a hideously washed-out look during the film's overexposed triple-daylight scenes and then wiping it all out with the deep, organic blacks and blues of the night shots. Say what you will about the story, but Pitch Black at least looks and sounds stunning. As Riddick, Diesel makes the most of his character's gruff otherness (The angle? He can see in the dark) and Mitchell is, as always, easy on the eyes. The rest of the cast, though,"
TWH_Doc7_PitchBlack,TWH,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch Black,"No other movie opening thrills me more than a vast ship in interstellar space. The modern visual rules for these shots were set by Stanley Kubrick's ""2001,"" which used a detailed model moving slowly instead of a cheesy model moving fast. Kubrick had the good sense to know that sound does not travel in space, but ""Star Wars,"" with its deep bass rumbles, demonstrated that it certainly should. And then in the ""Alien"" and ""Star Trek"" pictures and in countless others, gigantic space cruisers aimed majestically at the stars, and I felt an inner delight that has its origins in those long-ago days when I devoured pulp space opera by Robert Heinlein and such forgotten masters as Murray Leinster and Eric Frank Russell.  My state of mind is best captured by a pulp mag that was defunct even before I started reading science fiction: ""Thrilling Wonder Stories,"" without doubt the best title in the history of magazines. I hope for strange and amazing adventures. Sometimes I am gratified. More often I am disappointed. ""Pitch Black,"" which begins in deep space and ends with a manhunt on a desert planet, falls somewhere in between: clever, done with skill, yet lacking in the cerebral imagination of the best science fiction. How sad it is that humans travel countless light years away from Earth, only to find themselves inhabiting the same tired generic conventions.  The movie begins during an interstellar mission, with the crew and a dangerous prisoner all in cryo-sleep. The ship collides with a cluster of rock fragments, which penetrate the hull like BBs through cellophane. The captain and several other sleepers are terminally perforated, and Fry (Radha Mitchell) assumes command. The ship crash-lands on a planet that circles somehow within a three-star system, where at least one sun never seems to set, and the surviving crew members have to fight it out with the vicious and cunning prisoner Riddick (Vin Diesel).  You may remember Diesel from ""Saving Private Ryan,"" where he was the hard-bitten Pvt. Caparzo. He looks like a mean customer, and he is. He shares no fellow feeling with the other survivors, expresses no responsibility to them, does not consider himself in the same boat and thinks only of escaping. Oh, and his eyes have a remarkable quality: He can see in the dark. Not a very useful ability on a planet with three suns and no night, right? (Hollow laugh.) What disappointed me about ""Pitch Black,"" directed by David Twohy, is that it didn't do more with its alien world, and less with its recycled human conflicts. I feel underwhelmed when humans land on another world and are so quickly reduced to jumping out from behind rocks at one another and playing hostage games. ""Pitch Black"" does have a nice look, all bleached blues and desert sands. And there are some promising story elements, one of which I am about to discuss, so you might want to set this review aside if you plan to see the movie."
TWH_Doc8_PitchBlack,TWH,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch Black,"If you ever wondered what it might feel like to be inside a spaceship cracking apart during a violent crash landing, Pitch Black gives you the experience bright and early. The camera jiggles around spasmodically, the actors shout unintelligible gibberish at each other, the sound hammers us. Unfortunately, this describes too much of the rest of the movie, too, without a crash landing as an excuse. Pitch Black is yet another insecure hissy fit of a movie - a thriller without enough confidence in itself or its characters to calm down for two seconds and let the actors speak to each other like human beings.  Movies like this copy the who-goes-there thrills of Alien and John Carpenter's The Thing without those films' grubby, everyday, human-scaled group dynamics. Here, the spaceship in question is carrying a motley crew mostly headed for someplace called ""New Mecca""; in addition to the expected Muslims (led by Keith David, of The Thing), there's a geologist, an antiques collector, a morphine-addicted cop, a teenage boy who's not what he seems, and a serial killer. This all smacks of gimmickry - these aren't people, they're conflict units. In Alien and The Thing, the people confined together were allowed personalities which could then flare up.  The only people in Pitch Black with anything resembling a personality are the serial killer, Riddick (Vin Diesel), and the ship's pilot, Fry (Radha Mitchell), whose soft features juxtapose nicely with her tough nature. Mostly, the people wander around on the parched, godforsaken rock they've landed on, squabbling over how to escape, while gradually being picked off by slithering monsters who thrive on darkness. Of course, this planet has three suns and thus no darkness, but wouldn't you just know a total eclipse happens to be approaching?  Pitch Black does have an imaginative look. Whenever the characters step outside into the alien air, cinematographer David Eggby (Mad Max) bleaches out everything, which makes sense: These are alien suns whose light is passing through an alien atmosphere, so of course things will look different. And I liked how Riddick, whose eyes have been doctored to allow him to see in the dark, emerges as the unlikely hero who alone can see the ravenous monsters. The Riddick's-eye view of the beasts is a neat touch of psychedelia.  Problem is, you may wish you could see through Riddick's eyes all the time. Pitch Black, like so many other horror movies in recent years, is too often so dimly lit that you can't tell what's going on. Yes, the latter half unfolds during an eclipse, but a film can be dark and still be visible (perfect example: Carpenter's Halloween). The expensive, computer-generated creatures lurk around in the dark, revealed to us only in teasing flashes - perhaps for the best, considering that what we do see looks heavily indebted to H.R. Giger's Alien/Species designs. And the editing, as usual, is far too jangled; if you don't like a shot, wait two seconds and it'll change.  I always chuckle at these movies, because"
TWH_Doc9_PitchBlack,TWH,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch Black,"When a spaceship crash-lands on a planet of three suns that is plagued by darkness as a solar eclipse hits, the survivors must fight the nocturnal batlike alien creatures. These aliens avoid the light and strike when it's dark. The survivors include a dangerous murderer serving a life sentence in maximum security, Riddick (Diesel), who has surgically implanted eyes that shine enabling him to have night vision. He also has awesome muscles that are pumped for action. He wore specially fitted contact lenses to give him that shine job look.  The survivors include: Riddick, who is in chains as he is being transported to another prison; the cruel guard, Johns (Cole Hauser), who it turns out has a few flaws in his personality - which include a morphine habit; and, the spacecraft's landing pilot, Fry (Radha Mitchell), who becomes the captain when it's discovered that the captain's throat had been slashed. These two leaders of the plan to get off the dark planet, Johns and Fry, argue all the time, and trust among the survivors becomes the issue. Fry had her moment of cowardice when landing the plane, as she almost panicked and pulled the cord to eject the passengers. This is something Johns uses against her. The other survivors include: a preachy Muslim imam, a holy man, talking up a storm about God; a prissy English antiquities dealer whose wine collection is used as lighting fuel to get them off this darkened wasteland. And a boy called Jack who turns out to be a girl named Jackie, as discovered through the efforts of Riddick's nose for sniffing out female hormones.  This sci-fi formula action flick is noteworthy for its splendid cinematography, as it was filmed in the Australian Outback, and also for its innovative editing cuts. The story line left me gasping for more light and the acting left me in the dark searching for one line of dialogue that wasn't shrill or trite. No actor was provided with a challenging part, but Diesel uses his powerfully muscular presence and deep baritone voice to dominate his scenes. He comes to say one-liners such as: ""They did not know who they were f*cking with!"" He says this to the dead aliens after he puts them out of their misery, but he might as well have spoken it to a sleeping audience.  The writer/director David Twohy (The Arrival) tries to bring some intelligence to the story, but the script is too shallow and predictable. The characters ranged from a shrill Radha to a cartoonlike Diesel. It is easy to root for the aliens to possibly, against all odds for such formulaic films, pick off all the survivors of the spacecraft. But three do survive and, in my opinion, that's three too many! This film didn't have a clue about what point it wanted to make. It was particularly unclear how good or bad they wanted to portray Diesel's character, as he kept changing from bad to good guy at every alien sighting. By the"
TWH_Doc10_PitchBlack,TWH,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch Black,"""Pitch Black"" is the first movie I've seen that tries to mix elements of a slasher film and an ""Alien"" sequel to get its thrills. It may also be the first film to arrive at the conclusion that, if a planet has three suns in its scope, they can all have simultaneous eclipses every 20 years or so. That certainly doesn't seem like a big deal, but for the characters who discover nocturnal aliens who feed on human flesh, the event is anything but welcomed with anticipation. In a landscape of brightly pale colors and peculiar ancient ruins, survivors of a crashed space vessel must come together and set aside their past differences for survival; once the suns have moved behind a planet circled in rings, the shrieks of alien beings and the crunch of eaten bones will be the only sounds they hear.  The movie is a result of peculiar intentions; director David N. Twohy builds up incredible tension during the first hour, only to completely extinguish it by having his characters roam around in the dark like victims of a horror movie. It is a picture that wants to combine formulas for its own benefit, but loses the nerve and abandons all hope once it becomes too dark to see anything clearly. To say the movie could have been great is most accurate; unfortunately, neither the characters nor the story have anywhere to go once the nightfall has settled in.  Kudos to the script for trying anyhow (which is something more than I could say for ""Supernova""). Our story opens up in an undisclosed location deep in space, where a space craft carrying several individuals begins experience turbulence as it speeds through a stream of asteroids. One of the vessel attendants, the fetchingly strong-willed Fry (Radha Mitchell), tries to subvert the problems at the main control panel, but the ship enters the atmosphere of a hot planet and crash-lands in the dirt at the cost of a captain and many important supplies.  The ship is torn completely apart--even one of the onboard individuals, a killer named Riddick who has been placed under maximum security watch, turns up missing. Seeking out water, and hopefully shelter, the survivors of the ship begin a trek across a wide-open desert that features desolate cemeteries, underground tunnels and three different suns keeping the planet's atmosphere lit up like Las Vegas. Meanwhile, the killer Riddick (Vin Diesel) remains missing; without a dead body, the survivors presume he is hiding somewhere nearby.  During their journey, they hope to find some form of life that can help in their journey off of the quiet planet; what they find instead is an abandoned outpost of human space ships, and some sort of hissing alien species that creeps through the ground hiding in shadows. There is no great explanation as to where they came from or why they're there, but their thirst for living blood (as demonstrated by one of them grabbing a human being and dragging him inside a dark passageway)"
