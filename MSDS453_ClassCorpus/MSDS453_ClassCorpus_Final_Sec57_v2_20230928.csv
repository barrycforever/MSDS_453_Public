0,XOY_Doc1_Mean_Girls,"`` In a wasteland of dumb movies about teenagers , `` Mean Girls '' is a smart and funny one . It even contains some wisdom , although I hesitate to mention that lest I scare off its target audience . The TV ads , which show Lindsay Lohan landing ass over teakettle in a garbage can , are probably right on the money ; since that scene is nothing at all like the rest of the movie , was it filmed specifically to use in the commercials ? Lohan stars as Cady Heron , a high school junior who was home-schooled in Africa while her parents worked there as anthropologists . She is therefore the smartest girl in school when her dad is hired by Northwestern and she enrolls in Evanston Township High School -- which , like all American high schools in the movies , is physically located in Toronto . What 's she 's not smart about are the ways cliques work in high school , and how you 're categorized and stereotyped by who you hang with and how you dress . Cady makes two friends right away : Janis ( Lizzy Caplan ) , a semi-goth whose own anthropology includes an analysis of who sits where in the cafeteria , and why ; and Damian ( Daniel Franzese ) , Janis ' best friend , described as `` too gay to function . '' They clue her in : The three most popular girls in the junior class are the Plastics , so-called because they bear an uncanny resemblance to Barbie . They 're led by Regina George ( Rachel McAdams ) , a skilled manipulator whose mother 's boob job has defined her values in life . Her sidekicks are Gretchen ( Lacey Chabert ) and Karen ( Amanda Seyfried ) . Janis and Damian warn Cady against the girls from hell . But when Regina invites Cady to join their table , Janis urges her to : She can be a spy and get inside information for their campaign to destroy Regina . And she can recommend an obscure brand of Swedish `` diet bar '' actually used by athletes to gain weight , so that slim Regina with her flawless complexion can find out how it feels to be chubby and spotty . `` Mean Girls '' dissects high school society with a lot of observant detail , which seems surprisingly well-informed . The screenplay by `` Saturday Night Live 's '' Tina Fey is both a comic and a sociological achievement , and no wonder ; it 's inspired not on a novel but on a nonfiction book by Rosalind Wiseman . Its full title more or less summarizes the movie : Queen Bees and Wannabes : Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques , Gossip , Boyfriends , and Other Realities of Adolescence . The mothers in the movie are not much help , however , and Fey 's screenplay wisely uses",XOY_Doc1_Mean_Girls,XOY,Comedy,Positive,Mean_Girls
1,XOY_Doc2_Mean_Girls,"Although Mean Girls is likely to be frequently compared to Heathers , and perhaps occasionally to Election , the movie it most strongly reminds me of is 1999 's Jawbreaker . All four of these films offer a darkly satirical perspective of high school and popularity , but , while Heathers and Election follow things through to the bitter end , Mean Girls , like Jawbreaker , loses its comic momentum before the closing credits roll . In this case , the ending is more sappy than happy and gives us the sense that the screenplay betrays its origins in order to avoid an unsettling denouement . As a result , Mean Girls works for its first three-quarters , then implodes as it approaches the finish line . In high school , more than at any other time in life , you are judged by your friends . There 's a clique for almost every type of student - even the loners have their exclusive group . In the lunchroom , you are where you sit , and , if you do n't fit in , you 're not invited . The high school pecking order , which favors good looks and brawn over brains and glasses , dictates that jocks , cheerleaders , and would-be models are royalty , while members of the chess club are to be avoided as if they carry a social plague . Most students eventually happily settle into their niche , but even the most anti-establishment would be lying if they claimed never to toy with thoughts of what it might like to be popular . Because popularity means power , friends , dates , and favors , and when you 're a teenager , what could be better ? Mean Girls introduces us to Cady Heron ( Linday Lohan ) , a 16-year old girl who is going to high school for the first time . After being home schooled for most of her life by parents who traveled all around the world , Cady is finally getting a chance to enter a suburban Illinois hell of peer pressure and hormones . Her first day is a disaster - the only one to pay any attention to her is her math teacher , Ms. Norbury ( Tina Fey ) . But , on day two , a couple of outsiders befriend her . One is a goth girl named Janis ( Lizzy Caplan ) and the other is an overweight gay guy named Damian ( Daniel Franzese ) . They teach her the ways of the school jungle , which , as it turns out , is n't that different from the African jungle where Cady spent some of her life . Then , unexpectedly , Cady is invited to sit at the table of the three `` plastics '' - the high school 's queen and two princesses .

2,XOY_Doc3_Mean_Girls,"She is immediately befriended by two of North Shore High 's friendlier social outcasts , the good-natured goth Janis ( Lizzy Caplan ) and gregarious teddy bear Damian ( Daniel Franzese ) . Cady finds kinship with the ostracized duo , the three of them quickly becoming best friends . But the newbie 's potent combination of beauty and brains also catches the eye of Regina George ( Rachel McAdams ) , the school 's cool and calculating Queen Bee , and she realizes straight away this newcomer has what it takes to usurp her powerful position . At the urging of Janis and Damian , Cady decides to fight fire with fire , insinuating herself within Regina 's clique of best friends , dubbed `` The Plastics , '' in order to conduct sabotage upon their collective social standing from within . Soon she appears to be every bit a member of The Plastics as stalwarts Gretchen Weiners ( Lacey Chabert ) and Karen Smith ( Amanda Seyfried ) are . Cady is strutting around the school wearing the latest fashions sporting perfect makeup . The teenager has managed to enter `` Girl World '' with high-heeled Machiavellian vengeance , turning friend against friend in a single-minded quest to end Regina 's reign , discovering in the process that life at the top of the teenage social food chain is far more addictive than she expected it was going to be . This is Mean Girls , the new film from House of Yes director Mark Waters , and it is one of the most pleasantly nasty surprises of 2004 . Inspired by Rosalind Wiseman 's Queen Bees and Wannabes : Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques , Gossip , Boyfriends and Other Realities of Adolescence , `` Saturday Night Live '' featured writer and performer Tina Fey has crafted a topical and supremely funny screenplay overflowing in insight . As depicted here Girl World is as complex and as full of shadowy espionage as a Robert Ludlum-penned CIA spy thriller , the extremes the teenagers in the film go to in order to backstab one another ingenious in their craven minutiae . I missed this aspect of high school myself . Spending my time between cliques , I tended to move within worlds , not really cementing myself with any one group in particular . Granted , I did n't exactly make the longest lasting friendships and save for one best friend , with whom I still converse on a semi-daily basis , most of the people I knew have long past from memory . But it is n't like I did n't take stock of these cliques , and like any reasonably smart kid I knew which girls to make friends with , which to keep on my good side and which to try and avoid . A girl like Regina would definitely have resided within that second group . So popular that all the school mindlessly follows",XOY_Doc3_Mean_Girls,XOY,Comedy,Negative,Mean_Girls
3,XOY_Doc4_Mean_Girls,"Mean Girls '' is somewhat of a phenomenon in the way that it connects to ( for the most part ) girls of all ages while also maintaining at least nominal appeal for everyone else . It 's rated PG-13 and yet much younger and much older audiences seem to appreciate the relatable material . Even if the main character is too attractive to be believable as a misfit , the theme of staying true to oneself and the comic examinations of fitting in , struggling with popularity ( or the lack thereof ) , and comprehending high school cliques are ideas few teens can avoid during standard adolescence . Written by `` Saturday Night Live '' veteran Tina Fey , `` Mean Girls '' is perhaps the most universal , notable project Lindsay Lohan has starred in ( so far ) . Cady ( Lindsay Lohan ) was raised and homeschooled in Africa by her zoologist parents giving her an advantage when it comes to intelligence , but a handicap when it comes to socializing with peers in the callous modernity of the United States . Her father gets a job in Illinois , causing relocation to Evanston Township High School for a taste of the public education system . She seems to handle herself well in front of adults , such as teacher Ms. Norbury ( Tina Fey ) , who reversely always embarrasses herself in front of the students . But when it comes to hanging out with the `` cool '' people , dressing fashionably , or courting guys with the correct school politics associations , she 's terribly naive . Right off the bat , Cady befriends two of the would-be losers in the school , Janis ( Lizzy Caplin ) , a goth who likes to judge classmates while eating in the cafeteria , and Damian ( Daniel Franzese ) , a large , relaxed boy who is admittedly `` too gay to function . '' Soon , Cady is warned about the `` Plastics , '' the A-list group of gorgeous girls who sit at the top of the food chain when it comes to popularity but she 's eventually drawn into their circle nonetheless , partly to act as a spy for Janis , and chiefly because Cady is enchanted by the overwhelming idolization they experience . Led by `` Queen Bee '' Regina ( Rachel McAdams ) , and consisting of followers Gretchen ( Lacey Chabert ) and Karen ( Amanda Seyfried ) , the Plastics are out to corrupt and destroy Cady 's reputation when the hapless newcomer starts to fall for Regina 's ex-boyfriend . `` Mean Girls '' is startlingly genuine when it comes to dialogue , stereotypes , coteries , and high school drama . This is a plus for Fey 's adaptation work , though the source material , a book by Rosalind Wiseman , certainly sounds authentic and influential : `` Queen Bees and Wannabes",XOY_Doc4_Mean_Girls,XOY,Comedy,Negative,Mean_Girls
4,XOY_Doc5_Mean_Girls,"The tagline for this movie - Watch Your Back - reminded me of Edie Falco 's cry from the heart when she had appeared at the Emmys to collect an award for her performance in The Sopranos . Horrible Joan Rivers had been nasty about her frock . Edie was crushed . She said it felt like `` being at the prom and discovering the most popular girl in school had stuck a wad of gum on your back '' . It 's the kind of mortification that can only happen in school , and the pain lingers , which perhaps explains why high school movies thrive . And in this genre , just at the moment , it is 17-year-old Lindsay Lohan who just so totally rules . Without being particularly sexy or smart or funny , she has a box-office profile that is mysteriously hot enough to fry an egg on . From almost nowhere , she has become the pert princess of films like Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen . This is despite the fact that she looks and acts much older than her years - and not in a precocious , sexily hard-nosed 13-going-on-30 sort of a way , but an SUV-driving soccer mom sort of way . Her best role by a mile has been in the body-swap comedy Freaky Friday , where she got to inhabit the form of Jamie Lee Curtis and looked scarily plausible as the burgerliche American working mother . Now Lohan is back in a standard-issue high-school comedy , all set to dominate the multiplexes this summer , focused on the perennially fascinating subject of cruelty and bullying and generally being a bitch - or , as this film coyly rephrases it , a `` by-otch '' . The comedy is , however , pusillanimously counterweighted with a solemn and Oprah-ish subtext that these are , like , way important issues , of the sort aired by the serious drama Thirteen , with Evan Rachel Wood . Movies ranging from comedies such as Heathers , Clueless and 10 Things I Hate About You to Alexander Schmidt 's incomparable satire Election and Gus Van Sant 's Columbine nightmare , Elephant , have shown how you can get far superior high school films in a range of flavours . This one tastes like decaffeinated Diet Pepsi . Lohan plays Cady , a new girl at high school who , like the teen-queen daughter in The Wild Thornberries , has been `` home-schooled '' by her explorer parents in a country the script vaguely refers to as `` Africa '' . As ever in the HS genre , we get her first-day point-of-view shot , as she threads her wary way through the melee outside class , with jocks and nerds and cool kids catching her eye briefly and contemptuously .

5,XOY_Doc6_Mean_Girls,"Mean Girls looks and feels like a 2000s comedy with one exception : it is more than that . It is the definition of an era , a portrait of the teenage ideology , a characteristic classic that can do no wrong . Before this week , I had never seen Mean Girls . I had heard of it but up until now , I had no idea what it was even about ( apart from girls presumably being mean ) . I knew that it starred Lindsay Lohan as the innocently inept protagonist , I knew that it is a coming-of-age comedy , and I knew that it was released in 2004 . What I did n't know is that Lohan is supported by a surprisingly strong cast in Rachel McAdams , Amanda Seyfried , and Amy Poehler ; I did n't know that it was based on a book , that the screenplay was written by the comedically intuitive Tina Fey and produced by SNL 's Lorne Michaels ; I did n't know that it was more than the habitual stab at teen comedy , another thoughtless rendition of the same composition ; I did n't know why it is so beloved . Now I do . Just like any other teen drama , Cady Heron ( played by a young Lohan and pronounced like Katey ) is quirky , quiet , and a social outcast . Although this may sound familiar , Cady is n't just any normal stereotype but an exciting hyperbole ; every trope is dialled up to 11 . In place of the ever-present nerdy exposition that explains why no one likes our protagonist , Mean Girls introduces Cady as an alien ; home-schooled and just moved to the US from Africa . It is n't that there is a reason for Cady to be disliked , apart from her mathematical mind and her pretty charm , she is simply unaware of how to act due to never having attended school , let alone an American one . This is n't going to be a relatable Breakfast Club but rather an emotional depiction of what the reality could be : a teen story told from the perspective of a melodramatic teen . Her first day at 'normal ' school is a trial by fire , but after settling down with the class exiles , Janis ( Lizzy Caplan ) and Damian ( Daniel Franzese ) , Cady is invited to sit with the popular girls , a.k.a . 'the Plastics ' an instantly iconic nickname that says everything . At first , she sees the three girls as friendly : the air-headed Karen ( Seyfried ) , the nosey Gretchen ( Lacey Chabert ) , and ring-leader Regina George ( McAdams ) , a name that can not be said with enough venom .

6,XOY_Doc7_Mean_Girls,"Teenage Cady Heron ( Lindsay Lohan ) was educated in Africa by her scientist parents . When her family moves to the suburbs of Illinois , Cady finally gets to experience public school and gets a quick primer on the cruel , tacit laws of popularity that divide her fellow students into tightly knit cliques . She unwittingly finds herself in the good graces of an elite group of cool students dubbed `` the Plastics , '' but Cady soon realizes how her shallow group of new friends earned this nickname . All throughout high school , tons of my female classmates quoted Mean Girls on a regular basis , saying things like `` That 's so fetch '' and `` On Wednesdays we wear pink '' . I knew it was from that movie somehow despite never having seen it . Another Mean Girls reference I saw all the time on social media was a scene from the film that reads `` On October 3rd , he asked me what day it was '' . For such a long time I never watched the movie because I thought it was just a silly girls flick . It just did n't look like it would be my cup of tea . But eventually , I caved in back in grade ten and decided to give it a watch and was absolutely gobsmacked to discover that it was actually kind of amazing . Who would have figured ? Suddenly I understood why people were quoting the film like it was some sort of iconic property . It kind of is . Mean Girls is a staple in the coming-of-age genre and one of the most iconic movies of the 2000s . After watching it for the first time years ago , I just could n't get enough . So what did I do ? I watched it two more times that week because I loved it so much . Yes , you heard me right . Sure , Mean Girls may be more enjoyable for female audiences , but I have to admit that as a guy , it 's still terrific in so many regards . Courtesy of Paramount Pictures For starters , it 's wonderfully hilarious in virtually every way . It 's a high school comedy that has much smarter writing than it has any right to have . There are plenty of clever , witty jokes that both teens and adults will get a kick out of . But as funny as the film is , one of its biggest strengths lies within its characters . The development each character is given is terrific . Our heroine Cady Heron is a drastically different person at the end of the movie than she was in the beginning .

7,XOY_Doc8_Mean_Girls,"Fans who found teen star Lindsay Lohan 's last outing , `` Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen , '' a little toothless may find the bite of `` Mean Girls '' more to their taste . Penned by `` Saturday Night Live '' writer/performer Tina Fey , this sassy if wildly uneven comedy navigates the treacherous high school jungle that separates cool cliques from wannabes , wading through some nasty behavior before delivering its moral message . Reteaming of Lohan with her `` Freaky Friday '' director Mark Waters does n't conjure the same antic spirit but has enough irreverent spark to connect with the female-teen target demographic and perhaps beyond . The model here clearly is `` Clueless '' still the high water mark for post-John Hughes high school comedies with a nod to `` Heathers . '' But the result feels perhaps closest to 1999 Drew Barrymore vehicle `` Never Been Kissed , '' both in the awkwardness of its plotting and in the basic thread of an unhip girl going undercover to achieve popularity , hurting her friends in the process and then emerging from hiding to dole out humanity lessons . Witty setup skips over the early life of Cady Heron ( Lohan ) , who 's been home-schooled through childhood by her zoologist parents in Africa and is experiencing her first day of real school at age 16 . Constantly returning to the animal kingdom as her frame of reference , Cady soon gets a sense of the complex subculture network of a Midwestern public high school . Desperate for friends , she hooks up with outsider freaks Janis ( Lizzy Caplan ) , a cynical punk , and Damian ( Daniel Franzese ) , who 's `` almost too gay to function . '' Determinedly aloof from the fray , the duo warns Cady to steer clear of The Plastics , an evil trio of Barbie dolls led by the school Queen Bee , Regina ( Rachel McAdams ) . But when Regina and her vacuous handmaidens Gretchen ( Lacey Chabert ) and Karen ( Amanda Seyfried ) decide initially for sport to admit Cady to their circle , she gets caught in the vicious game-playing of `` Girl World . '' When Cady reveals she has a crush on resident hunk Aaron ( Jonathan Bennett ) , Regina 's treacherous nature emerges . This sets Cady off on a retaliation sabotage plan to strip the queen of her crown . Bouncing between her true friends Janis and Damian and the faux gal pals she attempts to bring down , Cady shimmies up the popularity ladder , but gets so giddy with the thrill of her sudden cool status that she momentarily loses sight of her real self .

QUEEN BEES AND WANNABES is a great book about the cliques amongst girls in high school , the bitching and bullying they can engender and the terrible damage they can do to the fragile psyches of young girls . It 's an American book dealing specifically with American teenage girls and American schools , so not everything in it applied to us Irish , but it was still an interesting read .

10,HBI_Doc1_Holmes_and_Watson,"Out of some morbid curiosity , and perhaps a self-destructive streak , I decided to watch the much-hated Holmes & Watson starring Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly . Although many adore the abrasive charms of Talladega Nights ( 2006 ) and Step Brothers ( 2008 ) , these movies have never appealed to me , often outstaying their welcome around the twenty-minute mark . My decision to screen their the latest comedy , which bombed during last year 's holiday season , was less about genuine interest than peer pressure . `` It 's so bad , '' a number of people have told me . `` You have to see it . '' Putting it on largely as background noise , I instantly regretted the decision . Holmes & Watson is frustratingly stupid within the first seconds ( it opens with a quote from Hannah Montana ) and continues for a painfully long , utterly laughless 90 minutes . In the movie , Ferrell and Reilly reduce two of literature 's most celebrated , intelligent characters to bungling idiots . Performed with vaguely effeminate mannerisms that should come across as an insult to the British , Holmes ( Ferrell ) and Watson ( Reilly ) investigate , sort of , a mystery to which the details are instantly foggyhonestly , as I write this , I just watched the movie and could n't tell you what it 's about . I can tell you it 's set in London during the early 1900s , and the production 's costumes , hair and makeup , and interiors look professional . The cast is also amazing ; it boasts several excellent , but absolutely wasted UK performers ( Ralph Fiennes , Hugh Laurie , Kelly Macdonald , Steve Coogan , Rob Brydon ) . The largely reference-based humor is dated , to the point where you wonder if the joke is so meta that it 's less about the reference itself than a self-aware gag about the dated quality of the reference . An absurd morgue scene riffs on the Patrick Swayze/Demi Moore 's pottery scene in Ghost ( 1990 ) ; the ending features Billy Zane reprising his role from Titanic ( 1997 ) ; and several sequences lampoon those moments from Sherlock Holmes and its 2011 sequel , when Robert Downey Jr. anticipated a series of moves that would incapacitate his enemy . Elsewhere , the movie 's attempts at randomness fall flat . Jokes about Holmes ' intelligence giving him psychic powers do not pair well with his inability to choose a style of hat , a thread that often leaves him looking like a pimp stereotype .

Or any day , for that matter . If you missed the Christmas Day arrival of Holmes & Watson on the big screen , consider yourself forgiven : the film was n't screened for critics and received scant promotion in advance of its release . Consider yourself lucky , too , because if you were planning on seeing the movie based on the kinds of Will Ferrell-John C. Reilly zingers that peppered Talladega Nights and Step Brothers , be assured that there are almost none to be had in this third pairing of the comic duo . Ferrell 's Get Hard writer-director Etan Cohen does double duty again here , but fails to coax his two stars into any kind of comic rhythm . Credit the script , which is a clunky mix of ancient jokes , pratfalls and geriatric gags designed to distract us from the fact that there is no story here at all , just the lame and slightly sad sight of grown actors peeing themselves when they 're worried the laughs have run dry . Sherlock Holmes has been done to death in recent years by the likes of Robert Downey Jr , Jonny Lee Miller , Ian McKellen , Benedict Cumberbatch , an animated Johnny Depp , and Canada 's own Matt Frewer , to name a few . But this is not a `` new spin '' on an old character : here Holmes has been so stripped of any literary reference it 's a wonder they bothered with it at all . Sherlock Holmes ( Ferrell ) and Dr. John Watson ( Reilly ) are pressed into service after a murder at Buckingham Palace . A calling card is left by the scheming Professor James Moriarty ( Ralph Fiennes , what were you thinking ? ) who declares that he will kill the queen in four days ' time if the first murder goes unsolved . Holmes alternates between genius and dum-dum . Watson is dissatisfied as Holmes ' sidekick , though the doctor 's offers of `` heroin or cocaine ? '' seem to be his chief medical qualification and means of advancement . Neither actor looks like they 're having any fun , regardless of the calibre of the jokes . In addition to Fiennes , given only a few lines , a standout supporting cast is criminally underused . `` Lady doctor '' Dr. Grace Hart ( Rebecca Hall ) and her mute companion Millicent ( Lauren Lapkus ) serve as love interests for the clueless sleuths .

The massive miscalculation that , at least for a time , registered a giant goose egg on Rotten Tomatoes . Bound for box-office ignominy and an inevitable rout of its 2018 Razzie contenders , Holmes & Watson is the fourth * collaboration between Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly , playing the title characters in that order . And it would certainly seem to be an unmitigated disaster . If only the results were so elementary . Sure , Holmes & Watson mines familiar ground , opening on yet another purposefully misattributed quote a la Ferrell and Reilly 's main works , Talladega Nights : The Ballad of Ricky Bobby and Step Brothers . It 's also a bountiful orchard of low-hanging fruit by way of anachronistic jokes that pad the movie to a commercially acceptable feature-length . Some are amusing , such as the continued presumption of cocaine , heroin and opiates as a pinnacle of medical treatment or an `` intoxigram '' as the drunk-text antecedent . Some are anemic , like the `` platypus-faced self-photograph '' preceding the duck-lips selfie . But the film is a far sight funnier than writer-director Etan Cohen 's first outing with Ferrell ( the witless prison comedy Get Hard ) . And even as Holmes & Watson never rises to Brothers ' sublimely absurd skewering of male maturity , it 's a brainier blunderbuss of buffoonish satire than Talladega . ( Quite tough to hoist a convincingly rigid middle finger at NASCAR culture when your other hand 's fist-bumping the top brass to gain organizational support . ) Holmes & Watson presupposes that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's standard-bearers for seamless logic are instead both utter dimwits dining out on long-faded success . Exuding even more fey-dandy energy than he did as Mugatu , Ferrell envisions Sherlock Holmes as an impudent man-baby as reliant on drugs to keep going as he is the codependency of his relationship with Dr. John Watson . Reilly indulges in spikier slapstick than usual to make Watson a trigger-happy dunce whose mantle of authority seems honorary at best . We first meet Sherlock in his school days , bullied by his peers into kissing a donkey 's ass . After learning to `` uncry '' and lock away his emotions , Sherlock gets the entirety of his school expelled ( leaving the teachers to focus solely on his intellect ) and takes as his only friend a young John . It 's no accident that the opening credits breeze through the pair 's salad days of criminal investigation .

13,HBI_Doc4_Holmes_and_Watson,"Maybe it 's just the holiday spirit , but I ca n't find it in myself to be particularly frustrated by Holmes and Watson . Admittedly , it 's no Step Brothers , and I ca n't help wishing for a more bizarre cut of the film ( there 's an undercurrent of weirdness to the whole affair that feels somehow tempered ) , but if it feels a little elementary compared to the best of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly 's work ( the aforementioned Step Brothers , Talladega Nights : The Ballad of Ricky Bobby , etc . ) , that 's not necessarily a damning distinction . That Ferrell and Reilly should take on Sherlock Holmes and John Watson , respectively , feels like a logical next step for the comedy duo , as they 've made something of a speciality out of two-handers featuring Ferrell as the bright star and Reilly as the yearning sidekick . Granted , their particular spin on Arthur Conan Doyle 's most famous creations paints his legendarily brilliant pair as emotionally stunted morons , but the point still stands : There 's an archetype that the story fulfills that 's a perfect match . What makes the film more than a retread , however , is also what makes it so unwieldy . As the detective and doctor work toward foiling an assassination attempt on the Queen ( Pam Ferris ) by none other than Professor Moriarty ( Ralph Fiennes ) , the situations they find themselves in become increasingly bizarre . Part of it is to do with the fact that cracking the case is secondary to cracking open their hearts , and part of it is a seeming indecision as to exactly what Holmes and Watson is meant to be . It 's not quite the absurdist art that Step Brothers is , nor entirely the political commentary of Talladega Nights ( a sharper look at the Bush years than this year 's Vice , with all due apologies to Adam McKay ) ; instead , it falls halfway in between , failing to make a completely coherent meal out of either approach . That said , if I had to wager ( with the full acknowledgment that such speculation is meaningless ) , I would say that director Etan Cohen was trying for something more in line with the former , as there are bizarre interludes scattered throughout that suggest a much stranger film . The best word to describe those moments is `` grotesque , '' as the film 's sense of humor goes beyond the usual scatological jokes plus the requisite period comedy jabs at modern culture and technological advancements , and some laughs at the expense of previous iterations of Holmes and Watson and ventures into genuinely strange territory . One scene , doubling down on Watson 's status as a sidekick rather than an equal , introduces something called the `` companions '",HBI_Doc4_Holmes_and_Watson,HBI,Comedy,Positive,Holmes_and_Watson
14,HBI_Doc5_Holmes_and_Watson,"One of the year 's most critically shellacked movies ( the pros were forced to watch it in theaters on Christmas Day alongside the common hordes ) , Holmes & Watson begins as ineptly as any comedy I 've seen , and then settles into an agreeably silly groove that had the common hordes around me yukking it up . When it 's bad it is , indeed , painful , but even third-rate Will Ferrell + John C. Reilly is more inspired than the noisy contraptions on either side of it in the multiplex . The twist is to make Sherlock Holmes , Arthur Conan Doyle 's pillar of 19th-century rationalism , into the latest of Ferrell 's posturing child-men , another symbol of the patriarchy 's dimming light . After being tricked by grade-school classmates into kissing the arse of an ass when he thought he 'd be kissing a girl , Holmes purges himself of emotion and becomes a giant brain doling out punishments to those who would underestimate his powers of ratiocination . Those powers in Holmes & Watson are rather elastic . Where the trend in modern Holmesiana has been to show the great detective as a stunted giant , Ferrell stunts the stuntedness , playing Holmes as a prissy drama queen who 's at least half idiot and always even when brilliant a fount of chaos . He and his schoolmate , Dr. John Watson ( Reilly ) , have never really left the playground . The rub is not that Ferrell and Reilly act like overgrown 11-year-olds that was the hook in Adam McKay 's Step Brothers , a high-water mark in modern infantile comedy . It 's that Ferrell 's brand of low comedy is best executed with high instincts i.e. , without the nudge-nudges and wink-winks . Watch Ferrell and Reilly make the breathless case to Richard Jenkins 's exasperated father/stepfather in Step Brothers that they should be allowed to create a bunk bed by setting one twin bed atop another : Their enthusiasm is contagious . Watch the pair 's Funny or Die line-for-line reenactment of the unintentionally surreal duet between Bing Crosby at death 's door and a joyless David Bowie : so subtle , so sublime . Holmes & Watson , on the other hand , is camp . Worse : rhythmless camp . It has been consistently misdirected by its screenwriter , Etan Coen ( no `` h , '' different guy ) , whose idea of editing is to make throwaway jokes broad and broad jokes bludgeoning . As a director , Coen commits comedy 's most cardinal sin : He gets between us and the performers .

Reilly and Steve Coogan and , at least if you 're an avid moviegoer , you realize that these actors , awful beyond awful in this film , have both turned in award-worthy , and I 'd dare say Oscar worthy , performances this very same year in the extraordinary Stan & Ollie . The realization hits you hard . I mean seriously hard . It 's difficult to describe just how wide this chasm is , but the closest thing I can find to describe it is the year that Eddie Murphy garnered serious Oscar buzz for Dreamgirls but just as nominations were being submitted Murphy 's similarly devastatingly awful Norbit was released in theaters . Not surprisingly , all the Oscar buzz in the world could n't save Murphy 's reputation and despite a tremendous Dreamgirls performance it 's safe to say that Norbit came close to killing Murphy 's career . While Reilly is likely safe from a similar fate here , especially given he 's actually given award-worthy performances this year in both Stan & Ollie and The Sisters Brothers , a film so incredibly awful as Holmes & Watson may very well sound the off-key death chimes on Ferrell 's already waning career as audiences tire of his man-child shtick and his films exude the rotted stench of cinematic desperation . And , let me just say , this is coming from someone who considers himself a Will Ferrell fan . There 's simply no excuse whatsoever for a film as awful as Holmes & Watson . Holmes & Watson is so awful that people in third world countries who 've never seen a film before would watch the film and decide they 've not been missing anything . Holmes & Watson is simply lazy . It 's lazy writing . It 's lazy filmmaking . It 's haphazard , self-indulgent , and so utterly devoid of anything resembling humor that it 's inexcusable that it was even released in theaters . This is the kind of film that indie filmmakers look at shrug their shoulders thinking `` How can I not catch a break ? '' And they have a point . The film has a brilliant supporting cast , most of whom have this deer-in-the-headlights look like `` Even for a paycheck film , this is really gon na ' suck . '' They 're right . The likes of Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon and Hugh Laurie and the nearly always impeccable Rebecca Hall are completely and utterly wasted here , far from impeccable and even farther from even watchable .

16,HBI_Doc7_Holmes_and_Watson,"The start of Holmes & Watson is both cynical and inexplicable . Dr. Watson ( John C. Reilly ) , apparently fed up of his life , is about to launch himself from the roof of Sherlock Holmes 's flat building onto his prized plant , which Holmes ( Will Ferrell ) does n't want him to . `` Fall over there ! '' he says , because a human life is less important than a plant 's , according to the film . Cynical , because of that . Inexplicable , because the two for some reason become friends right after . The basic premise of the film is this : Moriarty ( Ralph Fiennes ) has apparently fled to America to avoid arrest , and used a lookalike to take the fall . Lestrade ( Rob Bydon ) does n't believe him , but Holmes runs with the theory regardless . Meanwhile , people are still being murdered , and the question that keeps being asked is , `` if the criminal who can outsmart Holmes is n't Moriarty , then who is it ? '' . It all culminates into some half-baked mystery about someone wanting to kill the Queen of England ( Pam Ferris ) . Holmes & Watson 's main downfall is that it does n't make sense on any account . If Moriarty is clever enough to avoid being captured by Sherlock Holmes , why would he have fled to America to begin with ? Why does he send a dead body in a cake to Buckingham Palace ? To send a message ? Surely , if you 're going to commit such a high-profile murder you would n't want anyone to know you were planning it , even if you were Moriarty . The fallacies do n't end there . Writer/director Etan Cohen could n't have understood what film he was making , because conceptually Holmes and Watson is all over the place . At the beginning of the film , Holmes is portrayed as someone who only thinks he 's hyper-intelligent , but is actually more incompetent than the people around him . But a couple of scenes later , Holmes will actually be intelligent , and then the comedy will stem from the fact that the people surrounding him are portrayed as idiots . The film is lazily written , too . It 's very difficult to tell whether it was supposed to be some kind of referential humour , but there 's a boxing scene which plays out almost exactly like a scene from one of the earlier Robert Downey Jr. Sherlock Holmes films ( of which I was n't a fan , but compared to this one , they 're like Citizen Kane ) . The joke is , of course , that the method of taking out his foe does n't work , and he almost gets pummelled .

17,HBI_Doc8_Holmes_and_Watson,"The script for what eventually became the simply awful comedy Holmes & Watson was first announced in 2008 . After a couple of cast changes , the project was shot in 2017 and delayed twice before appearing as one of the least-merry films that could possibly have opened on Christmas Day , 2018 . That decade weighs heavily on it ; it feels years past its freshness date , and while I think most of what 's objectionable about the movie would have been objectionable regardless of the release date , it could only possibly have helped to get it crapped out when its references felt only mildly dated . The film is n't just a buddy comedy about the famous detective Sherlock Holmes ( Will Ferrell ) and his chronicler , friend , and assistant Dr. John Watson ( John C. Reilly ) ; it 's also a direct parody of the 2009 Sherlock Holmes with Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law and its 2011 sequel Sherlock Holmes : A Game of Shadows . Big enough hits in their day , to be sure , but I think nobody will disagree too much if I suggest that they 've left very little mark on the pop culture landscape . Even so , both are scintillating , classical works compared to Holmes & Watson , which reteams Ferrell and Reilly 12 years after Talladega Nights and ten years after Step Brothers to stiffly play at the same busy comedy of loudness . I did n't find it funny then , and I find it positively embarrassing now , particularly with Holmes & Watson handing duties from Adam McKay to Etan Cohen , whose solitary previous work in that capacity was 2015 's Get Hard , one of the most broadly-hated Ferrell starring vehicles . If I were to say `` Sherlock Holmes parody made in the 2010s '' , I imagine you could get most of the way through the script on your own , but for form 's sake : the film opens with what will , retrospectively , turn out to be one of its best scenes , as working-class schoolboy Sherlock ( Hector Bateman-Harden ) arrives at boarding school , only to find that his earnestness and romanticism make him an easy target for bullies . Vowing to never feel a human emotion ever again , he turns himself into an observational genius who discovers the secret crimes of all his classmates and has , eventually , the entire student body expelled , allowing him years of honing his intellect until he becomes the genius known and beloved throughout all England . Flash-forward to 1896 , and the master detective is faced with a crime so devious it taxes even his skills : someone is impersonating Professor James Moriarty ( Ralph Fiennes ) while making threats against the life of Queen Victoria ( Pam Ferris ) and while Inspector Lestrade ( Rob Brydon ) of Scotland Yard",HBI_Doc8_Holmes_and_Watson,HBI,Comedy,Negative,Holmes_and_Watson

Reilly on the big screen for the first time since Step Brothers , alongside Rebecca Hall , Kelly McDonald , Ralph Fiennes , Rob Brydon , Steve Coogan , and Hugh Laurie ... but it 's also written and directed by the man who gave us Get Hard . If you detect a `` no shit , Sherlock '' gag coming from the direction of this film , you 've got the right idea . Pitching itself as a a strangely belated parody of Guy Ritchie 's Sherlock Holmes movies , the film picks up after the evil Professor Moriarty ( Fiennes ) has gone into hiding in America , and largely concerns itself with the friendship between Sherlock Holmes ( Ferrell ) and Dr John Watson ( Reilly ) . When their old nemesis issues a death threat against Queen Victoria , ( Ferris ) the duo encounter a mystery that will test them to their limits . This review is written with the view that Step Brothers is a modern masterpiece a kind of reverse Bugsy Malone about a family in arrested development , whose plot is an utterly circumstantial reason to string together some sublimely stupid setpieces . Sherlock Holmes stories are not naturally suited to this kind of plotless laugh-fest , but at its best , this one ca n't hold a candle to it . While there are a couple of inspired gags , including a take-off of Ghost that involves sponging cake from a cadaver and an honest-to-goodness musical number with music and lyrics by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater , these only really stand out because of how humdrum the rest of it is . In a film like Step Brothers , the insanity never lets up long enough for you to single out any one thing as unusual . With so many different takes on Arthur Conan Doyle 's characters in pop culture in recent years , this has some distance to go in order to be distinctive . Even in terms of comedies , it does n't hold a candle to the underappreciated Without A Clue , which starred Michael Caine as `` Sherlock Holmes '' , the dimwitted actor who serves as a faceman for Ben Kingsley 's Dr Watson . That 's a take so good that you could remake it today , but in the case of Holmes & Watson , it seems they were n't necessarily ready to put the work in . The core dynamic is similar to that of another Ferrell and Reilly collaboration , Talladega Nights : The Ballad Of Ricky Bobby , but that 's not even really unique as Sherlocks go .

19,HBI_Doc10_Holmes_and_Watson,Holmes & Watson is probably exactly what I 'd expect from Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly teaming up to tell a Sherlock Holmes story . It is totally absurd and bonkers but whenever the two team up for a comedy they tend to be this way . If you liked their other team up comedies then you might enjoy this one as well . I would say it 's one of their weaker movies but there is still some enjoyment here . This movie starts out to explain Sherlock Holmes personality and how he became the way he is in the movie . He 's teased and bullied as a child . This results in Sherlock becoming a cold calculating individual bent on serving justice with the power of his mind . Fast forward 30 some odd years and we have the adult version of Sherlock . He has his obedient sidekick Dr. Watson by his side for all of his crazy antics . He 's just minutes away from locking away his arch-nemesis Moriarty and the two are doing the same old Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly shtick that you 'd expect . They 're yelling absurdities and overreacting to absolutely everything around them . Meanwhile time is ticking and you can tell that they have absolutely no concept of the urgency of making it to the courthouse on time . I kind of like this type of humor . It made me reflect on how absurd it is for me to care about the timing of getting things done in the movie . I 'm kind of imposing my own societal pressures to the characters in the film . I even laughed at myself thinking why do I care that they get things done on time ? This bit of reflection made me realize how funny it really was . Will Ferrell plays an egotistical idiot perfectly again as Sherlock . John C. Reilly plays the obedient side-kick Dr. Watson very well . It 's actually perfectly cast . Anyways after the courthouse fiasco the real story begins . They realize that there is a Moriarty copycat trying to outwit our heroes . It really is n't much of a story and that 's not why you would watch a Will Ferrell/John C. Reilly buddy comedy . You 're looking for the various situations that they 'll get them in so that he can become absolutely absurd . I like that they kept this movie pretty clean but you can tell what they are really insinuating . They did n't have to be dirty to have dirty jokes . Still much of the jokes are n't about being dirty . They have a lot of jokes that play on our knowledge of everyday things today and implementing them into early 1900s situations .

20,JCT_Doc1_Dirty_Grandpa,"`` Dirty Grandpa '' is the latest in the line of vulgarian comedies that tries to succeed off of a cheap formula . The formula is that it 's so vulgar , tasteless , and irreverent that , eventually , by chance or by fate , it will get a laugh out of its audience . It may only be one , it may only be two , it may be only every ten minutes , or even more sporadic and inconsistent than that , but it will eventually get a laugh or two out of you . The problem is the entirety of those laughs often amount to about a minute or two of actual comedy , and in this case , enduring the remaining ninety-six minutes is quite an arduous task for such a feeble reward even a monk would pass up . With that being said , I counted two hearty laughs in `` Dirty Grandpa , '' and several sporadic chuckles from Jason Mantzoukas 's rowdy and zealous performance as a local small-business owner/drug dealer in the film . That latter fact already sends up quite a few read flags , as this is a comedy where the emphasis rests on the age-gap and the talent of the two lead performers , Robert De Niro and Zac Efron respectively . While the two men exercise what seems to be a lack of boundaries and restrictions on what they 'll allow themselves to be put through in this film , none of this particularly helps their credibility and further distracts both from the wealth of more interesting roles they could be taking . The film revolves around Jason Kelly ( Zac Efron ) , a lawyer who is looking to wed his longtime fiancee in a little over a week . After the death of his grandmother , Jason 's grandfather Dick Kelly ( Robert De Niro ) asks if he could potentially drive him to see his old Army buddy and have some grandfather/grandson bonding . Despite the time-crunch , and knowing how distant his grandfather and father are , Jason takes him up on his offer and drives him in his fiancee 's pink car , which Dick refers to as a mobile labia . It only gets better . While eating at a diner , Jason runs into Shadia ( Zoey Deutch ) , an old friend of his , who is eating lunch with her friend Lenore ( Aubrey Plaza ) , an unapologetically crass woman who is looking to complete her sex trifecta of having sex with a freshman in college , an alum , and a professor .

The thing the enormous difference between many of those films and Dirty Grandpa , the newest entry in this outlandish genre is Robert De Niro . De Niro , a fearless actor , a two-time Oscar winner and an amazing performer , stars as the title character in this new film . The big question that comes to mind after seeing the finished film is why he said yes to this crude comedy . Within moments of the film 's opening sequences , Dick Kelly ( De Niro ) who has recently lost his wife after a long battle with cancer masturbates to a porn video and is n't shocked when his obviously-horrified grandson Jason ( Zac Efron ) walks in . It would be hard to say that the movie does n't improve from there ( how much lower can it go ? ) . It does but it never manages to outgrow its sophomoric comedic roots . Dick barely has time to mourn for his wife who he says he loved endlessly before he decides to recruit Jason for a road trip from Georgia to Florida . Jason is an engaged professional lawyer whose marriage to his cold-hearted fiance Meredith ( Julianne Hough ) is only a few days away . After his grandfather guilts him into saying yes , Jason decides to accompany the patriarchal man he once loved spending time with . To his surprise , that man no longer exists . Instead of the generous grandfather he once knew , he finds that his grandfather has become an obnoxious and sex-crazed pervert who wants to have unprotected sex with any young woman he can find . De Niro seems to be enjoying himself here as he undercuts the tough guy character he 's played so many times before . This is n't the De Niro we 're used to . Unfortunately though , his character is one of the most vulgar and obnoxious characters we 've ever seen him play . The actor has performed in some worthy comedies in the past ( in movies like Meet the Parents and Analyze This ) but those films worked because the punchlines were stronger and better-written than any of the sex jokes here . His character here is a one-note jerk whose behavior is horrifying and shocking to many of the people he meets . Efron here is also playing against type in beginning the film as a straight-laced corporate lawyer who is far more conservative and respectable than his horny grandfather .

The main conceit of the film is based on the idea that everyone young and old would love to see acting legend Robert De Niro acting like an irresponsible college senior . Not going to lie , I myself was intrigued by the idea while still aware that I was going to get a Wal-Mart bargain-barrel assemblage of d * * k jokes . In that regard , mission accomplished movie ; now if only Robert De Niro gave a darn . The movie begins with the wake of Dick 's ( De Niro ) long-time wife . Jason ( Efron ) his grandson is a corporate lawyer set to wed a shrewish woman ( Hough ) who seems to decide everything for him , down to the color scheme of the wedding . Partially out of a fear of old age and partially out of a desire to see Jason liberated , Dick convinces Jason to drive down to Boca Raton with him because `` it 's what your grandmother would have wanted . '' On the way down Jason bumps into an old flame from college ( Deutch ) , her libidinous best friend Lenore ( Plaza ) and their tag-along Bradley ( Bowyer-Chapman ) . Dick convinces Jason to follow them to Spring Break and take part in an escalating array of tomfoolery . In fairness to Mr. De Niro if there is any actor on the planet who deserves to coast it would be him . His career spans sixty years . He has been nominated for seven Academy Awards ( winning two ) and has been an invaluable stable player to the likes of Martin Scorsese and David O. Russell . Even as he got older he had no trouble transitioning into challenging roles and even made the successful transition to self-parody playing his machismo to comic effect . This is the first movie I have seen him in where he seems completely aloof ( that includes The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle ( 2000 ) ) , yet on his very worst day he 's still does a better job than half the cast in this movie . There are multiple characters that could have had moments to shine ; Danny Glover , Mo Collins and Adam Pally are so underutilized that they might as well have been written out of the movie . In fact , the only real stand out is Plaza who during the first and second act does a convincing job flirting with De Niro .

The story of one of the U.S. Coast Guard 's most daring rescue missions is compelling , but it is not done justice here . It 's an uneven thriller that focuses on the wrong side of the equation , and the result is a film that never soars as high as it should . Set on the New England coast in 1952 , Chris Pine plays Bernie , a lovable member of the Coast Guard who has just gotten engaged to Miriam ( Holliday Grainger ) . Bernie goes in to announce the engagement to his commanding officer ( Eric Bana ) , but before he can he is sent out in a blizzard to rescue an oil tanker that is split in half and sinking just off the coast . Bernie and a small crew including a severely underused Ben Foster set out to find and rescue the survivors , despite the conditions and long odds . The screenplay for `` The Finest Hours '' ( credited to three writers ) opts to focus more on Bernie and Miriam 's budding romance including a lengthy prologue on how they met . There is also a subplot about a previous rescue mission by Bernie that ended tragically , but it feels more like a plot device used to add tension . Grainger 's performance quickly wears thin , as the character who is supposed to come off as this headstrong , independent woman becomes increasingly annoying and overbearing . And Pine is too big of a star to pull off this lovable everyman , despite his best efforts . What works in `` The Finest Hours '' comes from the other side of the rescue . The scenes on the sinking ship provide the most dramatic moments , with Casey Affleck as one of the ship 's crew members giving the best performance in the movie . When `` The Finest Hours '' deals with the sinking boat , the film works . It 's too bad the film is steered in the wrong direction . Also in theaters While `` The Finest Hours '' has at least a little promise , the same ca n't be said for `` Dirty Grandpa '' ( F ) .

Not because the Robert De Niro/Zac Efron/Aubrey Plaza raunch comedy was particularly good , but because , apparentlyI did n't see any of the movie in my dream , just had conversations with people about itit did n't do that thing that studio-produced-raunch comedies do , which is take things so far and no further . No . In my dream , `` Dirty Grandpa '' was spinning heads because it broached John Waters/Harmony Korine levels of outrageousness . The sex scenes between De Niro and Plaza had a `` Last Tango In Paris '' level of explicitness , for instance . Now you just have to take my word for it that I had this dream , but honestly , I did . The question is WHY did I have this dream . As the author of a book on De Niro , I 'm frequently ( okay , not that frequently , but more often than would be the case for a guy who had n't written a book on De Niro ) asked what I make of his various career moves . So maybe the dream speaks to my critical desire to see De Niro go back to surprising his audiences with audacious performances . Or maybe I 'm just a perv who wants to see Aubrey Plaza naked . I do n't know . The weird thing is , although the non-oneiric `` Dirty Grandpa '' does not feature Aubrey Plaza naked ( although she gets closer than one might have expected ) , the movie is , as in my dream , a genuine envelope-pusher . Its crudity is relentless . The subjects of its indifferently crafted and callously executed jokes include roofie-ing , crack smoking , child molestation , jailhouse rape , graphic depictions of penises in the shape of a swastika being displayed to a rabbi , and more . The sort of thing you might expect in a John Waters or Harmony Korine film . Only in a John Waters or Harmony Korine film the jokes might be funny , or pointed . Here they are not . Early in the film 's road trip , De Niro 's horny patriarch is trying to charm some ladies on a golf course ; on being stymied by uptight soon-to-be-married lawyer grandson Efron , he responds with a panoply of puns based on the term , if you 'll excuse it , `` cock blocker .

This movie was a disaster in every imaginable way . It 's a movie that 's by the numbers and after the first 5 minutes you know everything that 's gon na happen in the movie and maybe it would have helped if the movie was funny but there really is n't anything funny in this movie . I chuckled one time . The writing is terrible and pretty much everything about the movie is disgustingly bad . I want to clarify that there 's a very big difference between good bad and bad bad movies . Movies like `` The Room '' are classics because they are so bad that you laugh at it because it 's a complete failure and you enjoy it . But then there 's bad bad movies where I really do n't know how you can derive any enjoyment from it . This was bad bad . None of the characters are likable or even realistic . You ca n't identify to any one of them and you ca n't care about them because they do n't feel like real people . The dialogue is n't realistic and the scenarios are n't realistic either . Every character in this movie feels either like a cartoon character or a straight up psychopath . The level of intelligence of the characters is basically zero . None of their actions make any sense and the whole movie just feels like a bunch of stuff happening for the sake of a joke and it 's never cohesive . I literally have never said this before because I am really not insulted or offended easily , but this movie really was offensive and insulting . The difficult thing about reviewing a comedy is that it 's really hard to pinpoint why something is funny or why it is n't , but this movie was definitely not funny . An example is in the beginning of the movie you kind of get to know the main characters cousin , who is just a total unfunny jerk and you do n't see him for the rest of the movie until almost the ending . And the payoff to that `` joke '' happens like an hour later . So it takes way too long for them to get to the `` payoff '' and it does n't work . That 's the only joke I can think of that felt like it had a setup and at least attempted to have a payoff . Pretty much everything else was racist and homophobic jokes .

26,JCT_Doc7_Dirty_Grandpa,"Okay , I know what you all may be thinking , Dirty Grandpa , the newest comedy featuring Robert `` Refusing To Take A Pay-Cut '' De Niro is just another sad excuse of a comedy featuring a world- class veteran actor whose acting days are numbered and career is slowly fading ? Actually , the fact of the matter is , Dirty Grandpa is a very funny , very over-the-top , very rambunctious comedy with nothing but entertainment value , laughs and some good old-fashioned Hollywood fun at the movies , poking redeem fun at itself following the heavy and highly melodramatic Oscar burdened December month . I can think of so many other disappointing January films that I 've seen in the past , that quickly make way onto my list of Worst Films of the year . Luckily for Dick Kelly ( De Niro ) and his lawyer loving grandson Jason Kelly ( Zac Efron ) , the two wo n't be making their way to that list . Filled with deadpan dirty talk , highly sexualize jokes , crude , rude and obnoxious taboo social references , Dirty Grandpa becomes one wild and dirty-minded fun filled trip to start off 2016 . Not that the film should be a reflection of the film caliber of 2016 , but Dirty Grandpa never becomes a film that falls and can not get back up . Instead , the first comedy of 2016 tells the similar story to Pixar 's Up ; but instead of the adorable Carl Fredricksen taking a wild trip on his hot-air balloon , Dick Kelly decides that , after a fifteen years abstinence , and with the loving approval of his dying wife , the secret ex-Military man decides to trick his favourite grandson along for a ride to Daytona Beach to find some horny and foul-mouth twenty somethings in a pink Mini Cooper . Kind of the same thing , right ? What begins as a simple guys trip with golfing , dining and some male bonding , quickly turns into a wild weekend looking for answers for both men ; sensory for Dick , and emotionally for Jason , who is unsure about his marriage to the all too perfect and tremendously overbearing Meredith Goldstein ( Julianne Hough ) , who ultimately becomes the sexiest Bridezilla we have seen on film in a while . Luckily for our unlikely duo , answers quickly come , in the form of Lenore ( Aubrey Plaza ) ; a wild mouth lascivious college girl looking to bone a senior for the sake of completing a life long list of hers ; and Shadia ( Zoey Deutch ) , a free-spirited , organic loving , tree-hugging hipster who is the complete opposite of Jason 's Meredith . With the girls off to Daytona Beach , Dick begs his grandson Jason to pursue them , knowing that Dick is surely going to be able fulfill his dreams",JCT_Doc7_Dirty_Grandpa,JCT,Comedy,Positive,Dirty_Grandpa
27,JCT_Doc8_Dirty_Grandpa,"For those that are lucky enough to still have them around , spend some time with your grandparents . As children , they may have seemed foreign and even spooky with their wrinkled and used image , but adulthood should eliminate those phobias . You 'll come to realize that age really does posses a golden amount of life experience that 's ripe full of smart ideas that they wished they would have known a while ago . My eldest grandfather is ninety-five years old and a World War II veteran . You know someone with that background will have lots of stories that are worth listening to . It 's also understandable that any grandparents talking to their adult grandchild will start to not only see themselves within their image , but even start to reminisce about what was good about being young . My grandpa has talked about that his one regret was that he did n't try harder to understand computers . He was never a high tech guy , but was really marveled at my LED television and how clear the football game was . I remember that my mother tried giving him the old family computer from the early 2000 's , but he never got into it . Watch how one grandpa tries to reclaim his youth with his grandson in Dirty Grandpa . We start with Richard `` Dick '' Kelly ( played by Robert De Niro ) who is initially grieving over the passing of his wife who has succumbed to cancer . He and his family manage to pull through a nice ceremony while some of the younger ones see this as a meet and greet . Dick 's grandson Jason ( played by Zac Efron ) seems like the one to have matured the most , with a lawyer job with his father , a yuppie wardrobe , and a controlling girlfriend Meredith Goldstein ( played by Julianne Hough ) . As a grieving matter , Dick has asked for Jason to drive him down to his Florida home to spend some time with each other . Upon picking him up , Jason finds his grandfather more unclean then he ever thought of him . While having lunch , Dick reveals that he wants to go to Daytona Beach during the spring break season just so that he can attract a college girl . Along the way , they bump into a group of young adults including a woman who likes older men Lenore ( played by Aubrey Plaza ) and Shadia , a classmate of Jason 's who knew of his photography passion . The trip to Daytona is crazy , wacky , and just the spark that not only satisfies Dick , but for the all too straight Jason as well . As you can tell , Dirty Grandpa is following the ranks of fellow party movies like The Hangover and Animal House . These can be hit",JCT_Doc8_Dirty_Grandpa,JCT,Comedy,Positive,Dirty_Grandpa
28,JCT_Doc9_Dirty_Grandpa,"Dirty Grandpa has an 11 % approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes . It was nominated for five Golden Raspberries and has an almost immaculate attendance record on critics ' worst of the year lists . Those who reviewed it were at pains to point out how filthy they found the experience . Mark Kermode needed a shower , Mike Ryan wanted to burn the prints and Glenn McDonald likened it to torture porn . For some , its chart-topping god-awfulness was n't just confined to 2016 . Deadline 's Pete Hammond called it not just the worst movie Robert De Niro had been in but `` the worst movie anyone has ever been in '' . Reader , I liked it . I liked it at the time and , watching it again last night , I liked it even more . It was n't just me . Dirty Grandpa 's CinemaScore which assesses opening night audience reaction on a scale of A ( for excellent ) to F ( for frightful ) is B . That 's worse than Joker ( B+ ) and an improvement on Little Fockers ( B- ) . These are , perhaps , revealing comparisons . For what really condemned Dirty Grandpa in the eyes of the critics was its position at the fag-end of De Niro 's decade horriblis : a prolific run of rubbish dotted with just enough class to remind you of a time before he dropped his trousers . In particular , Dirty Grandpa came in the wake of Last Vegas and The Intern : laughless horror-shows notable only for uncomfortable elderly tumescence . Dirty Grandpa , by contrast , embraces old erections . De Niro 's character has spent 15 chaste years caring for his wife , to whom he was faithful and devoted for 40 . Now she 's died , he 's unabashed about trying to seize whatever life is left particularly if it 's young and female . So he enlists Zac Efron 's uptight lawyer to drive him to Florida for Spring Break , in the hope his hot young grandson will be an effective wingman . But Efron is the opposite until his drink is spiked , he inhales epic amounts of crack and wakes on a beach naked save for a novelty thong and a swastika of penises drawn on his forehead , before having to FaceTime his parents , fiancee and rabbi . Is that upcoming wedding really a good idea ? And was grandpa 's road trip really as self-serving as it seemed ? Dan Mazer ( a longtime Sacha Baron Cohen collaborator ) and his team are firmly on pop 's side . Not only is De Niro an unlikely Jack Reacher , duffing up a gang who dare to threaten a black gay friend , he 's also filthily sage about the perils of sleepwalking into marriage and not sowing your wild oats while you have the chance .",JCT_Doc9_Dirty_Grandpa,JCT,Comedy,Positive,Dirty_Grandpa
29,JCT_Doc10_Dirty_Grandpa,"I figure the new Robert De Niro comedy is called , simply and inelegantly , `` Dirty Grandpa '' because `` Filthy-Foul-Mouthed-Misogynist-Sex-Crazed-Pervert-Filthy-Rotten-Old-Coot-Grandpa '' was too ungainly for the marquee . De Niro plays Dick Kelly , a recently widowed seventy-two year old . His grandson Jason ( Zac Efron ) is a twenty-something who gave up his dreams of being a photographer to study law and join his father ( Dermot Mulroney ) firm . Jason has his life figured outhe 's about to marry the beautiful but controlling Meredith ( Julianne Hough ) but is tragically unhip . According to grandpa he is like `` Mitt Romney in Terminator . '' The grieving grandfather asks Jason to drive him to his summer home in Florida . `` Your grandmother and I were there this time every year , '' he explains . `` It 's what she would have wanted . '' Instead of a melancholy pilgrimage the trip takes a sideways turn when Dick goes on the prowl for a woman . He gets the chance to hook up when Jason bumps into Shadia ( Zoey Deutch ) , an old schoolmate of his , and her friends , including the oversexed Lenore ( Aubrey Plaza ) . `` The greatest gift a grandson can give to his grandfather , '' says Dick , `` is a hot college girl who wants to have unprotected sex , '' so they take a detour and follow the crowd to Daytona Beach . There they meet a male drug dealer named Pamela ( Jason Mantzoukas ) who introduces Jason to crack cocaine , get thrown in jail , compete in a bodybuilding contest and much more . Of course Dick 's unorthodox behaviour is ripe with life lessons ... you just have to endure 60 minutes of pedophilia , masturbation and rape gags before those lessons become apparent . `` Dirty Grandpa '' is credited to one writer but feels like it was penned by a group of drunken frat boys on the beer and bourbon binge . What , I guess , is supposed to be a funny look at aging and making the most of the time we all have , is reduced to a spectacle of a once revered thespian calling his lawyer grandson `` Alan Douceowitz . '' If this were a drinking game where you took a shot every time De Niro says `` vagina '' ( and all of that word 's derivations ) or any number of other words I ca n't print here you 'd have alcohol poisoning half an hour in . It mistakes politically incorrect `` did he really just say that '' jokes for actual humour . Then there is the presence of the great man himself .

32,KDB_Doc3_Barbie,"I saw this movie with my youngest daughter , 19 and LOVED it ! ! But , as I became more and more immersed in Barbie World , I could n't help but let a few thoughts creep in about how the far right , anti woke are going to have a conniption over the wonderfully positive messages the movie oozes . If you just sit back and enjoy the ride-it 's summer and there 's actually a good movie out -then you 're in for a treat bc the acting is superb , the scenery is pretty amazing and the storyline and mini US history lesson hits the nail on the head and truly brings tears to the eye and very positive messages to all viewers . However , I 'm going to bet that most men wo n't like it bc they ca n't relate to Barbie , and they do n't understand how girls felt growing up and the limitations that come along with womanhood . Barbie acknowledges how the dolls were a failed attempt at inspiring and empowering girls , and that these dolls were actually doing just the opposite to girls growing up , but most men will probably not tap into empathy about young women 's body image issues , sexism , equal rights , etc . If you have n't seen it , you should go on a rainy day , grab a popcorn and just kick back bc Barbie 's world is SO authentic and if you or your kids ever played with Barbie and Ken , it 's thoroughly enjoyable for the sets and authenticity alone , if you do n't want to get too deep with meaning . I did n't see this as some `` woke '' movie -it 's message is not some big secret-it 's the reality of the girls of the 1960's-2000's-it is 100 % relatable to a huge hunk of our population . No surprise as to why it 's made a billion dollars already . Enjoy the acting , the scenery and the humor and music if you do n't want to hear the message . Movies are what you make of them . My daughter and I enjoyed everything about the movie , and the messages were icing on the cake . It deserves to be recognized because it was great on so many levels . Oh , and Kate McKinnon as `` Weird Barbie '' - HYSTERICAL ( because we 've all had one ! ! ) and Rhea Perlman as Ruth Handler-GENIUS ! ! One last thing-the light- hearted way they poked fun at Mattel for their very poor marketing choices over the years was honesty like nothing I 've ever seen in a movie- that Sugar Daddy ! ! !

'' and not bragging but i know about it lol . i just realized i really know a lot about barbie than an average person 's knowledge of barbie . there 's just so many inside jokes that mostly a barbie fan would understand . also , the little reference to duolingo ! as a duolingo , i recognize it immediately . i thought the movie would be a usual barbie movie about romance and achieving dreams , well , it kinda is , but it 's more than that . it 's about woman empowerment and equality ! it really is hard to be a human woman . i love how it breaks the stereotypical ideas of barbie and talks about things that matter and what 's happening in the reality that is often not talked about ( because it 's taboo or people are just used to injustice ) not about everything being positive and lovey-dovey and glittery stuff . i also like how it talks about misconceptions about barbie and what barbie is made for . it also talks about embracing negative emotions ; that it 's okay to feel sad and cry , about how change is a part of our lives and it 's fine to be scared of the future , about how it 's fine to not be perfect all the time and be your usual self , that it 's fine not knowing what to do next and still figuring everything out . it also features a mother and daughter relationship . i like movies about mothers and daughters . also , i like how it 's not a romantic movie . there 's not even a kissing scene , thank goodness ! the depiction of barbie and ken in this movie shows them as a person and not as a couple , that they do n't exist for one another # selflove the building of the story line is",KDB_Doc4_Barbie,KDB,Comedy,Positive,Barbie
34,KDB_Doc5_Barbie,"When I first heard a Barbie movie was in the works , I was skeptical . Though I loved Barbie as a child , I had become somewhat disillusioned with the brand and anticipated the film would be nothing but a marketing ploy . However , as soon as the first trailer was released , in all its Space Odyssey glory , I was enthralled . Barbie proved to be extremely well-crafted cinematically , it 's hilariously meta ( say this in your best Shirley Bennett voice ) , and its extensive use of easter eggs rivals that of the comic book world , which is notorious for its subtle referencing of source material . It 's no secret that there was an incredible amount of work put into the making of Barbie , and it paid off . Margot Robbie was the perfect casting for the role . Not only can she deliver emotional depth , but her comedic timing is perfect , and she has a surprising knack for physical comedy ( as also seen in Birds of Prey and James Gunn 's The Suicide Squad ) . The rest of the characters are also cast well , from well-known stars such as Ryan Gosling , Will Ferrell , America Ferrera , and Issa Rae , to up-and-comers like Ncuti Gatwa , who is set to be the next Doctor in the Doctor Who franchise , and Simu Liu , who plays the titular hero from the MCU film Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings . The film expertly comments on existing social structures by presenting Barbieland as an inverse of the Real World , in which Barbies run the world and Kens exist as nothing but accessories . This is at first presented as a utopia , but the viewer is quickly shown that these inequities are harmful to the Kens , and the facade of perfection is harmful to all who live there , Barbies , Kens , and Allan alike . At the end of the film , these inequities are addressed , as the Kens learn that they are `` just right '' the way they are , and the structural matriarchy begins to include Ken perspectives ( with a wonderful quip about the slow pace of integrating female perspectives into our own leadership and society ) . Though at face value , Barbie may appear to be a misandrist film propping women up above men , in reality it is an exploration of patriarchy through the lens of both the oppressor ( Barbies and men ) and the oppressed ( Kens and women ) , with one minor differencethe men in the Real World use sexual objectification as a means to oppress women ; the Barbies do not do the same with the Kens ( rather ignoring them completely ) , and the closest Barbieland comes to this actually comes from the Kens themselves as they mirror the way men interact",KDB_Doc5_Barbie,KDB,Comedy,Positive,Barbie
35,KDB_Doc6_Barbie,"Just watched this today and honestly I do n't understand what the whole point was . The first 10 minutes is just them saying `` Hi Barbie , Hi Barbie , Hi Ken , Hi Ken '' and they made the Kens look stupid the whole movie and have no purpose in life . They basically just are magically always on the beach `` beaching out hoping Barbie would just look at him '' . They even point out `` oh where do the Kens sleep at ? I have NO idea ! '' basically is saying they do n't have Kens contribute at all the Barbieland and all they are is dumb dressed up side pieces for the Barbies . At one point ( Barbie played by Margot Robbie ) was telling Ken ( Ryan Gosling ) `` there is no Barbie and Ken '' but it 's like they never showed who he was supposed to be other than a Ken doll just chasing after Barbie the whole movie until all the Kens took over Barbieland . They had n't even explained why his and the other Kens were fighting or what they were fight over just looked like some big West Side Story fight dance scene . Overall it was just stupid and I was trying hard to get what the point was . So it 's a movie about sexualized patriarchy starts with the Barbies in charge and then the Kens . When she hits the real world she was seen as a sexual object to all the men everywhere she walked and the woman hated her as well as the teenager who use to play with the Barbie as a kid . And when Barbie gets upset after being told by the teenager she 's a sexualized capitalist symbol she does n't even tell her how she is n't any of those things . She just gets upset and runs away crying saying no I 'm not . This film should 've been her proving how she was n't those things but she never did . She just wanted it to `` perfect back to the way it was before which is literally just her and all the other Barbie 's claiming everything and leaving everyone else out of it . Then to say she fixed a mother and daughter bond is lie because all she did was jump in their car and they drove off to Barbieland only after the Kens took over then she just gives up entirely laying facedown to the ground . And the fact that at the end of the movie like the last 4 minutes she FINALLY realized she did n't want to be Barbie and be a normal human being was just was too rushed . Instead there should 've been a thing where she was able to observe and learn from the real world and connect that to Barbieland and start living in the real world .",KDB_Doc6_Barbie,KDB,Comedy,Negative,Barbie
36,KDB_Doc7_Barbie,"It 's a shame because I love Little Women and Lady Bird . Barbie did not serve . It 's a long ramble about how matriarchy is perfect and patriarchy is stupid . I agree with the latter , but the execution is just awful . Mattel 's CEO and corporate people started as a mockery of men having all the top positions in a company ; as the movie goes , they 're just there at the back of your mind , and it 's an unpleasant experience because they did nothing after . There were so many unnecessary scenes that could have been meaningful . For example , what 's the scene where Allan fights other Kens for ? I 'm also surprised that there were no gay Barbies and Kens . And I thought this was supposed to `` break '' gender norms . So many seeds were planted at once , but none reached their full potential . Here are some examples : 1 . The mother-daughter relationship : The premise of the story started well . The daughter is disconnected from her mother . You thought the movie would revolve around fixing that problem ? No . The daughter has no problem . She 's just a teenager . 2 . Mother 's longing for her daughter : Barbie became curious about death because the mother is playing with her Barbie differently . She 's drawing weird ( sigh ) Barbies . You thought it was because she had a rough childhood , and now is the time to heal her inner child ? No , she misses her time playing with her daughter . While it is an okay backstory , I see no reason why it is related to Barbie getting curious about death . 3 . Corporate men of Mattel : It 's always been shown that patriarchy is for stupid men and their horses . The corporate people , who were all men , tried to catch Barbie so they could remanufacture her and send her back to Barbieland . But Barbie went to Barbieland , and they STILL FOLLOWED HER . It took them too long to get there for no apparent reason . And when they got there , it just got very confusing . Why were they in there ? What were they trying to fix ? Is it Barbie 's sudden consciousness of death ? If that 's the case , Barbie 's actions throughout the movie become meaningless . Because if she chose to be remanufactured , Barbie 's main goal ( to fix herself ) , would be done already . Remember , she still does not want to be human in this part of the movie . So why would she not want this option ? It does n't make sense . 4 . Barbie wanting to be human : The movie 's theme .

37,KDB_Doc8_Barbie,"I did not understand this movie at all . It had 3 separate plots and only one got `` solved '' . First , Barbie goes to the real world to find the person that plays with her doll version because she is beginning to look imperfect and the only way to change that is to change the view of the person using her not herself . Second , the Kens are tired of being ignored and in the shadows of the Barbies so they take action and perform a 3 hour coup ( How ! Just how ? ) . This coup forces all the barbies into over sexualized submissive objects . This is all because Ken saw men in the real world as the leaders and saw horses ? I think ? Idk . Third , Barbie takes back Barbie land by reinstating matriarchy which sounds good but forces the kens into a worse oppression than the women in the real world . It even said at the end that in a few years the Kens will reach the level of equality that real world women have . Yikes . Women now are pretty oppressed so imagine the Kens . At least pro-equity groups have momentum . What real Pissed me off was the ending , character development , and story . The story was all over the place . For some movie science reason , the Barbie world was an opposite of the real world but was also the same at some points ? Once again , idk . Most movie stories can be outlined in 2D complexity with some more complicated 3D like Inception , Interstellar , Space Odyssey , or Tenet . Meanwhile this movie needs a 4th dimension to explain itself and it was n't even sci-fi . The characters were worse . Every man and women there were the most fit I 've ever seen . Ken was ripped but there were no fat Kens . Barbie was thin with little muscle and there was a fat Barbie just to say fat is good . I 'm not much of a body positivity activist but it 's alright to have a bit of flab just do n't turn into a full on bowling ball . It puts the `` handsome '' stereotype on men as being ripped but women are pretty if there 're anything except ripped . There was no workout Barbie as there was no fat Ken . Finally , the ending . I was thinking , oh , there could be kids watching this ( But what do I know about parenting , I do n't have kids ) , the directors probably want to end it with `` they all bounded off together hand to hand , seeing eye to eye '' . Nope . They end it with a dump truck load of misandry . To save some a google search , it 's the girl version of",KDB_Doc8_Barbie,KDB,Comedy,Negative,Barbie
38,KDB_Doc9_Barbie,"While it may serve as a rudimentary reminder of very real existing social problems , there seems to be a lack of any coheisve , meaningful plot ; nor development of any of the characters . I seemed to be forced to sit through a movie that was more focused on the one-sided ridicule of `` the patriarchy '' than the development of its own story , and letting the viewers draw their own conclusions . While certainly movies can serve as a vessel to outline existing societal issues ( catcalling , objectification of women , male dominated sectors leading to consciuous/subsconscious oppresion of women ) , I feel like it certainly makes your pespective more convincing if its done so with finesse , class and substance . All three were missing from this movie . This movie was all about the shaming and mocking of certain groups of men , the insecure , the weird ( alan ? apparently no one cares about him cause hes different ) , the obsessed with power and domination and horses ( `` the patriarchy '' ) , the douche and the corporate douche . While I dont agree with certain behaviors from some of these groups , the mocking of these groups of men almost felt propoganda-like and comedic , and it felt like it lost the very point it was trying to make due to its poor delivery and outragenousness . The subversion of power from male dominated to female dominated was also very key . Whilst I agree women should have equality of oppurtunity in every way , this movie was all about fighting fire with fire . `` we were once oppressed so now let us be the oppressors '' . Lets emotionally manipulate these unsuspecting men and pretend to be impressed whilst we hatch a plan to turn them against each other . Very distasteful and not the type of change we need in the world today . I understand gender issues are real in society today but an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind . Do n't let good men around the world feel shamed/like they have to pay for the sins of others/previous generations of men . I walked out of this movie feeling ashamed to be male honestly . And this leads me to my next point . Ken stands to be the blanket term for all men . Everyone is Ken . And without any other meaningful male lead to show us otherwise , the portrayal of Ken just shows the poor portrayal of all men . Sure , he had a lesson to learn about finding himself and his own identity ; but where is the making of this man ? Where are his strong and good traits ? Every good antagonist is relatable , has strong traits ( Captain Vidal from Pan 's Labyrinth , Walter White from Breaking Bad , King Commodus from Gladiator , even Thanos )",KDB_Doc9_Barbie,KDB,Comedy,Negative,Barbie

The supposed intention of the film was to empower women , but instead did nothing but tear down men . Men are leaving this movie feeling bad about being a man , and feeling like they owe something to women , which is all a part of the gaslight that the directors were aiming for . Women , on the other hand , feel as though they must rave about how good this movie is , because in what world other than an imaginary world is the world run entirely by women ? The answer is that there are in fact no real worlds run entirely by women , but there are also no real worlds run entirely by men , despite what the left wing media wants you to believe . The idea that a world could be run by entirely one gender is preposterous , and all attempts to do so have failed . The film also takes unnecessary shot 's at capitalism , which served as comedic relief for me and my friends , because brands such as Mattel , Chevrolet , and Barbie itself are all featured heavily in the movie , and all have reaped incredible benefits from a capitalist society . My final point will outline the different ways that the film sexualized everything from women to kids to men . If I were a woman I would be appalled at the film 's suggestion that sexualization is empowerment . Being comfortable in your body does not mean showing it off to everyone that walks down the street , and being uncomfortable in your body does not mean you are in the wrong body , because that accuses the Creator of making a mistake , which he is incapable of doing . I am also appalled by the sexualization of children in the film which is becoming so normalized in our society by the radical left wing media . Barbies are a child 's toy , so , naturally , kids are going to be seeing this film which the directors are well aware of . With that in mind , I ask many questions : Why is Barbie wearing such a small dress ? Why is a Barbie always worried about her looks and claiming to be perfect ? Why are there homosexual and trans characters and actors ? Why are men in the movie shown catcalling and staring at women 's bodies ? Why are the women portrayed as the victims when they are actually oppressing the men ? There are many other questions I have , but these are just a few that outline content that is not kid friendly . To be fair , it is rated PG-13 , but why on earth does a film about a child 's toy have to have PG-13 content when they know the children will be watching ? ?",KDB_Doc10_Barbie,KDB,Comedy,Negative,Barbie
40,MDO_Doc1_LostCity,"The Lost City isnt an especially unique film ; its premise draws on Romancing the Stone and countless other adventure movies . Its punchlines are recognizable from a distance as the volcano dominating the remote island where most of the story takes place . This is a movie you can get a clear sense of from its opening moments , every beat clearly telegraphed.There is , however , a significant amount of comfort and delight in all this familiarity . Directors and co-writers Adam and Aaron Nee understand exactly what their audience wantsmuch like a good romance novelist mightand deliver an undeniably charming ( and refreshingly IP-free ) romantic romp . This is a movie you watch in the theater , with popcorn , then again and again on streaming , with a glass of wine.Loretta Sage ( Sandra Bullock ) is a burnt-out romance writer whose grief after the loss of her husband threatens to derail her career . Her disdain for her books is only matched by her dislike of their cover model , Alan ( Channing Tatum ) , a seemingly dim beefcake who indulges her readers at signing events.After an event promoting her latest book , Loretta is abducted by explorer/rich guy Abigail ( its a gender-neutral name , apparently ) Fairfax , played by Daniel Radcliffe . Fairfax knows that the lost city from Lorettas book is real , and he wants her to translate some ancient writing that leads to a treasure before a volcano erupts and covers the whole thing . Alan mounts an ill-advised expedition to save Loretta , with help from his meditation guru , Jack ( Brad Pitt ) , and Lorettas beleaguered editor Beth ( DaVine Joy Randolph ) .Loretta and Alans eventual romance is unavoidable , but The Lost City does a great job exploring the mounting chemistry between Bullock and Tatums characters . In particular , the movie highlights Alans emotional intelligence and unwavering support . He may be the kind of guy who refers to Loretta as a human mummy , but he also knows she gets cranky without snacks , and that she could use a slightly more sensible pair of shoes traversing all that rocky terrain . Like many a beloved romantic hero , Alan is not only a gorgeous man , hes a man who cares.Tatum is great casting for a role like this on several levels ; not only does he look like he belongs on the cover of a romance paperback , hes also an actor who understands his own appeal and has proven time and again that he isnt afraid to play it for laughs . Bullock is also more than happy to play into her characters physical awkwardness and eventual shedding of her prickly exteriorits not exactly unfamiliar territory for her , either .

Due to some details included in her newest book , the very rich and very deranged Abigail Fairfax ( Daniel Radcliffe ) believes that she has the archeological expertise to actually find a lost treasure on a remote Atlantic island , and so he kidnaps her , whisking her away to said island and demanding she use her knowledge of the islands ancient folklore to help him.Alan , determined to prove that hes not totally useless , enlists the help of a savvy adventurer ( Brad Pitt showing up for a fun lil cameo ) to help Loretta escape Fairfaxs clutches , but soon the two of them are alone in the jungle , fighting for their lives and , as often happens when two attractive people are alone in a jungle together , fighting for their lives , a connection blossoms even as Fairfax continues to pursue themThe romance novelist goes on an adventure out of her romance novels genre isnt a particularly expansive field , but it is a pitch that Hollywood has bought more than once or twice . So amongst the many challenges faced by The Lost City is finding a way to take this familiar premise one where previous examples like Romancing the Stone remain pretty iconic and make it fresh.Fortunately , directors Adam Nee and Aaron Nee manage to find just the right balance between action , comedy , and romance to make all three work harmoniously together , while playing with a team of all-stars who make the material sing . The Lost City didnt have to go so hard to be so successful , but the extra effort is what ensures that this film might actually endure in our memories , unlike other , more forgettable attempts at this story.Sandra Bullock is one of our great living physical comedians , though she doesnt get nearly enough recognition for this facet of her stardom . So , if nothing else , watching her contend with her true enemy in this film the sparkly pink jumpsuit that she wears for a good percentage of it is a wonderful reminder of this fact . Its not just the fact that shes wearing it , but how it affects her physicality : One of the films earliest jokes is just Bullock in that jumpsuit , trying to get onto a stool , and it kills.Oh , and also , she deserves an Oscar just for navigating nearly the entire film in heels .

His goofy charm , coupled with the radiant and reliable presence of Sandra Bullock who , at the age of 57 , continues to lead action and romance like nobodys business keeps the film afloat , even when its mere 112-minute runtime starts to feel endless , and fewer of its jokes begin to land.Its directed by brothers Aaron and Adam Nee , who also share writing credits with Dana Fox and Oren Uziel . Whether or not the production was a case of too many cooks , it often feels like it , between its dropped threads , its unfunny ( though mercifully truncated ) subplot detours , and its litany of jokes added via ADR and delivered from off-screen , only about half of which work in any given scene . However , when a movie is this self-assured of its stars and what they bring to the table , no amount of haphazard filmmaking can prevent it from being enjoyable.Bullock plays burnt-out romance author Loretta Sage , who balks at the prospect of yet another book tour where her heartthrob cover model Tatums Alan Caprison , in character as her golden-maned hero Dash McMahon hogs the spotlight . Twenty volumes in , she abruptly decides that her latest steamy paperback , The Lost City of D , will be her last , and will thus be Alans swan song too , which leads to an exchange of unpleasant words between the reluctant duo . However , before the well-meaning Alan can apologize , he witnesses Loretta being taken hostage by Daniel Radcliffes skeevy businessman Abigail Fairfax , who hopes to use Lorettas real-world skills as a former archeologist to translate and uncover the location of a hidden treasure , if only to prove to his family that he can . It turns out Fairfax may have discovered the lost city about which Loretta had been writing , pouring elements of her old career into works of fiction by which she now feels shackled.Armed with AirPods , a neck pillow , and a rolling suitcase , Alan mounts a rescue mission with the help of his suave former trainer , the mysterious mercenary Jack ( Brad Pitt ) , whose resemblance to the fictitious Dash ignites sparks between him and Loretta , and ignites Alans envy . However , before long , the mission goes off the rails , and Alan and Loretta are left to their own devices , caught between finding their way off a mysterious Atlantic island , and potentially uncovering its archeological secrets.Bullocks character is given more emotional heft than the trailers let on .

Its fun and hilarious , and its on-the-nose praise of the romance genre is something well never tire of exploring.In the height of series like Bridgerton taking Netflix viewerships by storm , the romance genre is rightfully earning its respect among people without much familiarity . We havent broken all the stigmas around it quite yet . Still , were getting there , and a film like The Lost City gaining well-received reception also plays a part in paving a better road for embracing feel-good and heartwarming adventures that end with a happily ever after.While The Lost City is more in line with films like The Mummy or Jungle Cruise in recent years , its careful attention to detailing a romance novelists importance is where it succeeds beyond Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatums ridiculously joyful chemistry.Theres a specific scene where Tatums character Alan , the cover model for Bullocks Loretta Sages novels , mentions how he was ashamed of the position at first but realized he should embrace it after seeing the amount of happiness the stories bring to the readers . It remains a tragic truth that romance readers have long hidden their books and love for the genre in various social spheres . It is also still very much not as renowned as a genre in scholarly studies either.And for the longest time , happy endings have been deemed cliches that should not be considered good writing despite the detail that its one of the top-selling genres yearly . Thereby , Alans decision to embrace the genre and everything that comes with it beautifully encapsulates the shift thats been taking place lately , with more fans showing off their favorite novels with pride than shame . Removing words like trash from our discourse and loving these books openly as opposed to telling people they should read ( or in this case , watch ) something more realistic.The Lost City is far from a real adventure , but it made people laugh out loud countless times in the theater while allowing them to leave feeling a little bit better than when they walked in . And what this line in particular does is it openly enables a man to embrace a genre thats predominantly read and embraced by womenA film like The Lost City isnt going to change everyones mind . No , that would be unrealistic to believe , but what it can do is be an exhibition of the fact that the romance genre can be honored more often than not . We can walk into theaters expecting silly adventures thatll fill us with joy and find ourselves thoroughly impressed with the outright decision to praise romance .

44,MDO_Doc5_LostCity,"As superhero films strengthened their grip on the industry , one of the first genres for studios to no longer deem a theatrical necessity was the romantic comedy . Nowadays , most people get their romcom fix from Netflix ( Set it Up , Always Be My Maybe , etc . ) but there was a time not so long ago when movies like My Big Fat Greek Wedding , Hitch , and Pretty Woman could pair a couple of movie stars ( Will Smith , Julia Roberts , etc . ) with a creative concept and make nearly $ 200 million at the domestic box office , packing in crowds like a Marvel movie . Cut to 2022 and , extraordinary exceptions like 2018s Crazy Rich Asians aside , most romcoms simply cant compete with the IP-driven titles that have theaters in a chokehold ; despite being critically acclaimed , 2017s The Big Sick and 2019s Long Shot , for instance , barely registered with average audiences . However , that doesnt mean some romcom aficionados arent still trying to keep the genre alive.Just this February , we saw the release of the Jennifer Lopezs Marry Me ( co-starring Lokis Owen Wilson as her mismatched love interest ) , and the multihyphenate even has another due for June Shotgun Wedding , co-starring Transformers Josh Duhamel . But , before that , this month brings us the long-awaited The Lost City , which not only gives Sandra Bullock yet another starring role in one of the genres shes most famous for ( While You Were Sleeping , The Proposal , you know the rest ) but also , along with last months Dog , serves as co-star Channing Tatums triumphant return to live-action cinema , having been absent since 2017s Kingsman : The Golden Circle . On paper , The Lost City looks like the kind of thing that used to be Hollywoods bread-and-butter a old-fashioned movie movie based around an original idea and led by two mega stars with clearly defined public personas who lure in audiences despite the lack of IP . And , in execution , its every bit the exuberant big-screen entertainment youd expect it to be.We start on Loretta Sage ( Bullock ) , a dissatisfied , middle-aged author who , following the death of her husband and her inability to publish a book on their archeological findings , turned to writing romance-adventure novels centered around a beautiful and brooding fictional hero named Dash ( who is given a vibrant visage by clueless cover model Alan Caprison , played by Tatum ) . But now , Lorettas found herself in a rut ; aside from rarely ( if ever ) leaving her house , shes grown disenchanted with the series as a whole , and she wants this latest book which shes about to leave for a book tour on to be her last .

Shes trying to finish her latest book , but shes been in a rut since her husbands death five years ago . Lorettas romance novels all have a treasure hunting and archaeological aspect to them because that was a passion she shared with her husband . Her publicist , Beth ( DaVine Joy Randolph ) , calls her multiple times a day to remind Loretta that she needs to find an ending quickly.Beth has planned a last-ditch book tour to make Loretta relevant again . She doesnt believe Loretta can handle the pressure of a book tour on her own , so she brings along Alan , the books cover model ( Channing Tatum ) . Alan believes he really is the fictional adventure hero hes portraying , but in actuality , he has no skills that would help save the day for anyone . Also interested in Lorettas latest book is eccentric billionaire Abigail Fairfax ( Daniel Radcliffe ) , who has been passed over in his familys mega-media conglomerate . Abigail is consumed with having something all his own , and believes the key to the treasure hes chasing is in Lorettas latest book . He kidnaps her and plans to force her to tell him where the treasure is . Alan sees the kidnapping as his moment to live up to his fictional counterpart and calls real-life hero Jack Trainer ( Brad Pitt ) to aid in the rescue mission.So much of The Lost City ultimately feels flat , as if the life has been sucked out of every scene . Part of the blame falls on the over-utilization of Additional Dialogue Recording ( ADR ) . When used sparingly , its difficult to notice ADR mixed in with the rest of the dialogue . In The Lost City , ADR was used too frequently , usually as a way to punch up the scene with attempts at jokes . Its very noticeable throughout the film , but occurs most frequently in scenes with Loretta and Alan . Often , its as though Bullock and Tatum are reacting to entirely different lines and situations in the scene . Through no fault of their own , they are completely out of place as random snippets of dialogue are dropped ungracefully around them.The movie truly shines where it spends almost none of its time : with Patti Harrisons dimwitted social media manager , Allison . She was in 2021s Together , Together , which was a critical darling on the indie festival circuit , but Harrison is not a household name . However , if nothing else , her tiny role steals the show .

The masculine man arrives to save the damsel in distress , bandits endlessly chase our heroes , and constant back and forths between will-they and wont-they scenarios are to be expected . Its unapologetically trite , and it just so happens to be both steamy and entertaining.This is why inserting Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum into The Lost City , a semi-romantic comedy/adventure , feels like it should be a home run . One is returning to her comedic chops , while the other is given a role meant to match his soft , mannish charm . Instead , the film is ashamed of its romantic sentimentality and , sometimes , even its own script . Actors feel like theyre dilly-dallying on their lines for the sake of naturalism while someone in their earpiece is desperately dissuading them from veering off-topic to no avail.The film begins with sexually charged prose and sprinkles of meta-commentary . Loretta Sage ( played by Sandra Bullock ) is a romance-adventure novel writer who hates writing romance-adventure novels . She bemoans having to work with Alan Caprison ( played by Channing Tatum ) , the doddering cover model who puts into flesh the imaginations of readers by posing as Dash McMahon , the hero of her book The Lost City of D. Loretta has expertise in Spanish history and anthropology , passions which she shared with her late husband ( a detail barely even scratched ) that she now includes in her books.Her latest book tour organized by her publicist Beth ( played by the talented DaVine Joy Randolph ) , is disrupted when Loretta is kidnapped by an evil British billionaire , Abigail Fairfax ( played by a hyperbolic Daniel Radcliffe ) . This prompts Alan , who has taken a liking to Loretta , to channel his inner Dash and hatch a rescue plan accompanied by his trainer , Jack Trainer ( played suavely by Brad Pitt ) . What ensues is a smorgasbord of chaos and hilarity spearheaded by a colorful cast of side characters that instantly deflates whenever we cut back to Bullock and Tatum.Sandra Bullock , best known for her rom-com turn in The Proposal , her iconic fish-out-of-water pageant antics in Miss Congeniality , and the fearlessly spirited Annie Porter in Speed , plays an amalgamation of the above roles to mixed results . Everything about her character is a walking contradiction , not in an elevated sense , but a trifling one . Shes a self-professed sapiosexual who writes sexually charged material that , in her eyes , lacks the substance worthy of her standards . She loathes the fact that her readers are impervious to her books deeper anthropological meaning because they prefer ogling at the smutty details .

47,MDO_Doc8_LostCity,"If you squint , you might recognise a slew of better films that the creators of The Lost City may have had in mind as they worked on developing Sandra Bullocks latest action , romantic comedy . Certainly , the film is rarely romantic , only fleetingly comedic and its action set-pieces are underwhelming . But you can make out some faint glimmer of what it might be attempting . For a film with four credited script-writers and an additional fifth person with a story by credit , most of what The Lost City could or might be , is eclipsed by the aggressive nothingness of what it is an incredibly tepid film experience.A writer in her late-fifties finds herself thrust into an unlikely romance with a younger man . Thats actually the plot for Nancy Meyers Somethings Got ta Give , where Diane Keaton finds herself navigating potential romance with a younger Keanu Reeves and an older Jack Nicholson . But it did occur to me while watching , The Lost City where Sandra Bullock plays Loretta , a late-fifties writer who finds herself in an unlikely potential romance with a younger man ( played by Channing Tatum ) how different romance , or the illusion of it , looks like when a movie actually has something to say . And its anyones guess what , if anything , The Lost City has to say . The bones of the plot are straightforward enough Loretta is a widow who writes romance novels and is on a book tour when shes kidnapped by Abigail Fairfax , a nefarious billionaire looking for a lost city with an allegedly priceless treasure . Lorettas historical research with her deceased archaeologist husband has Fairfax convinced she can help him locate the treasure . In an attempt to convince Loretta of his devotion , her cover model ( Tatum as Alan ) embarks on a rescue mission to the remote Atlantic Island . Chaos ensues , then adventure and then romance.If that all sounds like a vaguely clumsy set-up for a film with so many writers , its not the only case of The Lost City feeling defined by a general noncommittal energy . Its a perplexing tone for a film that carries a lot of weight . In a post-pandemic world , the question of whether audiences will venture out to cinemas for anything beyond the spectacle of superhero fantasy is a big question . And the intentions of a mid-budget romantic comedy , led by a woman ( Bullock also produces this ) is a great idea . A world with more romantic comedies on the big-screen is a better world , especially ones that honour women over fifty . Yet , little of anything in The Lost City feels as exciting , or innovative or engaging as that potential might be.Is it a radical point to say that a film must both be romantic and comedic before its allowed to market itself",MDO_Doc8_LostCity,MDO,Comedy,Negative,Lost City

To me , it felt like it started off as a prank , where one of them might have suggested an idea of roping in Brad Pitt for a super-cool cameo as a sexy , undercover guy named Jack Trainer in what would essentially be an unofficial remake of Robert Zemeckis gleefully pulpy but wholly watchable action-adventure Romancing the Stone.Then , they might have decided to cast the super-dashing Channing Tatum to play out an extension of his dumbfoolery from the Jump Street movies , and Sandra Bullock as well , Sandra Bullock from all her 90s movies . The result would make a fairly entertaining movie that would glide along on their chemistry alone . However , what we do get here is an over-stretched , unfunny , and terribly written film that doesnt know if it wants to be a treasure hunt adventure , a reworking of the damsel in distress trope , a moving-on from a grief tale , or a rom-com that ends with a kiss.Anyway , Bullock stars as Loretta , a reclusive novelist who writes these pulpy treasure hunting adventures that are less treasure hunting and more of a sexually charged romance between Angela and Dash ( the main characters from her book ) . We meet her first in the midst of her frustration as she dodges her agent Beths ( DaVine Joy Randolph ) calls to finish the final chapter of her new book . We get to know that it has been 5 years since her husband passed away , and instead of moving on , she has decided to limit her interactions.This is why , a book tour that involves interacting with people in a body-hugging-sparkly-jump-suit-dress , has to be the last place she wants to be . However , when there , we also meet Dash ( basically Channing Tatums Alan donning fake blond hair ) , who apparently has a thing for her , but is unable to connect because of a sort of intellectual shield that Loretta has built around her . Alan , who considers himself dumb is unable to traverse around that.But , before things could get sex-cringe , Loretta is kidnapped by some hoodlums who apparently work for Abigail Fairfax ( Daniel Radcliffe ) . Please note that this character makes sure to tell us that this is a gender-neutral name and that you are not allowed to make fun of it ( Me : Its 2022 , and no one is making fun of it anymore ) .

Because the stars are Sandra Bullock , Channing Tatum and Daniel Radcliffe , with an inside-joke cameo by Brad Pitt in a long blonde wig , the appeal for audiences with low standards and no knowledge of ( or interest in ) genuine comedy timing is guaranteed .

This is also Daniel Craig 's fifth and final appearance as 007 , so enjoy his previously indestructible stoicism for the last time , too . Do this , I hasten to add , only if you are forever dedicated to a fictional action hero who , in your heart of hearts , can do no wrong . In my opinion , he ran out of steam long ago , and now in retirement from Her Majesty 's Secret Service , he has no charm , no wit , no sex appeal , no fatal allure for women and he 's losing his hair . He dies from stray bullets , deja vu , stale dialogue and mixed reviews . The car chases , the fight sequences ( there are two ) , the helicopter shots , the never-ending guns and exploding warheads have all been done before . This is probably to be expected . You do n't go to a James Bond movie to learn anything new . You go to ogle the latest girls , gadgets and exotic locations .

No Time to Die may not be the worst James Bond movie ever made , but it 's in heavy competition as the dullest one since Octopussy .

The appealing predictability of familiar characters and the excitement of seeing variations on their themes has always gone hand in hand with a sense of overmanagementof the strings being pulled by some puppeteer far from the set . The feeling that what 's onscreen is inseparable from the demands of the balance sheet has never been absent from the Bond market , and the five entries starring Daniel Craig have only intensified it . Together , the Craig films interconnect to form a sort of Bond cinematic universe whose parts slot all too neatly into a series , with all the dramatic engineering that it implies . The most recent and final Craig film , `` No Time to Die , '' directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga , is in that sense a culmination of the series ' necessities , with the boardroom and the writers ' room virtually taking the place of any cinematic action . On the other hand , the series ' essential virtue was always its extravagant exaggerations . It was gloriously ridiculous and gloriously lacking in self-awareness , its macho ribaldry invested with absurdly high purpose . In the Daniel Craig era , there 's no sense of unconscious or excess expression . It has been digitized out along with any intentional humor . The devices that Bond and his compatriots use are hardly a step from Maxwell Smart 's shoe phone , as are the switch-operated gizmos of his Aston Martin . Yet their depiction and use are so perfunctory that they 're presented as neither silly nor ordinary , just checked off . Craig is a great actor who brings a distinctive affect to Bondclenched , airtight , impenetrable , abraded . He makes Bond 's social graces seem like the product of work that 's harder than the athleticized superhero business imposed upon the character . Craig 's distinctive persona suggests pathos that the series does n't allow ; instead , he 's merely used as a Bond-pinata , a straining for an element of realism amid stunts that , in their grandiosity and their excess , preclude it . In `` No Time to Die , '' Bond is launched with mourning and melancholy : he and his new partner , Madeleine Swann ( Lea Seydoux ) , visit the Italian town of Matera , where the tomb of Vesper Lynd ( from `` Casino Royale '' ) is found .

There is n't a lot for the `` new '' supporting cast to do , but they are all represented : Ralph Fiennes as M , Naomie Harris as Moneypenny , Ben Whishaw as Q , Jeffrey Wright as Felix Leiter , Christoph Waltz as Blofeld , with the addition of Lashana Lynch as Bond 's purported replacement at MI6 and Rami Malek as the evil Liustifer Safin . But this film is all about taking stock of James Bond as he attempts to leave his job behind and create a new life with Madeleine ( played by the exquisite Lea Seydoux ) , who stole his heart in Spectre ( 2015 ) . In making Bond more vulnerable , screenwriters Neil Purvis , Robert Wade , Cary Joji Fukunaga and Phoebe Waller-Bridge have demanded more of their low-key star than we have ever seen . This is a more emotional , mature character ( although he will have his little jokes ) truly a James Bond for the 21st century . Talented director Cary Joji Fukunaga gives Craig time to breathe between wisecracks , and his grudging acceptance of a female colleague is a definite nod to the # MeToo era . There is little to dislike about this handsomely mounted production , from Daniel Kleiman 's visually ingenious opening title sequence to the post-credit promise we have all relied on since Dr. No back in 1962 . But with so little to prove and such a strong team to execute its winding storyline , why stretch things out so long ? I found myself growing impatient to `` get on with it '' and see how Daniel Craig would bid goodbye to the character he has played for fifteen years . Now that the ending will be revealed on social media by the Spoilers many moviegoers wo n't even have that bait to keep them glued to the screen . Do n't get me wrong : I liked No Time to Die ... but I would have liked it better if there were less of it .",BKG_Doc3_No_Time_to_Die,BKG,Action,Positive,No_Time_to_Die
53,BKG_Doc4_No_Time_to_Die,"From `` Lawrence of Arabia '' to `` Iron Man , '' from `` Casablanca '' to `` Jaws , '' some of the most memorable films ever have gone into production without a completed script a roll of the dice that would seem particularly insane in this age of nine-figure budgets , and yet reports indicate that 's exactly what happened with Daniel Craig 's fifth and final Bond movie , `` No Time to Die . '' In an interview with the Middle East edition of Esquire , director Cary Joji Fukunaga says the writing process continued even as shooting wrapped , saying `` there are pieces that Ralph Fiennes [ as M ] says in the trailer that neither Ralph nor I knew exactly what he was saying it for , '' says Fukunaga . That explains a lot . There are times during the exciting and engrossing but convoluted and far too long `` No Time to Die '' when things got so muddled and ambiguous and drawn out , it felt it as I was watching a late-stage rough cut still in need of one last trim or two . ( At 2 hours , 43 minutes , this is the longest-running Bond movie ever . Before `` No Time To Die , '' Make Time to Pee . ) Also , it would have been an upset if we DID N'T get the obligatory megalomaniacal-villain-who-wants-to-destroy-half-the-world-so-he-can-rule-the-other-half , and suffice to say , there 's no upset . Still , this is a breathtakingly gorgeous , sometimes thrilling , well-acted and suitably profound sendoff to Daniel Craig in all his ice-blue-eyed , tightly wound , gritty gravitas a Bond who seemed much more of this world than , say Roger Moore 's 007 , a Bond who bled when he was cut and bruised when he was beaten , a Bond who grieved deeply for those he lost , a Bond who will be a very , very tough act to follow . Craig was the best James Bond since Sean Connery , and I wo n't argue about who was better because each was perfectly suited to their tenor of their respective times . After a tense and expertly rendered prologue flashback sequence to the childhood of Bond 's `` SPECTRE '' love interest Madeleine Swann ( Lea Seydoux , excellent ) , we find James living the good life with Madeleine in Italy . After an explosion and an extended action sequence in which Bond demonstrates he still has a way of out-driving , out-shooting and out-foxing a mere two dozen hired henchmen or so , he puts Madeleine on a train and tells her it 's the last time they 'll see each other . Bond goes off the grid for a prolonged period of time ( a la `` Skyfall '' ) and is either forgotten or presumed dead , but just when he thinks he 's out , they pull him",BKG_Doc4_No_Time_to_Die,BKG,Action,Positive,No_Time_to_Die
54,BKG_Doc5_No_Time_to_Die,"It 's been more than a year since No Time to Die was supposed to open in theaters , and while the pandemic is far from over , the movie 's long-overdue release feels like a good omen for an industry that could use it . Never mind if James Bond can save the world can he save the movies in the era of COVID and streaming-service domination ? I have no idea . I can only say that it 's a poignant pleasure to see Daniel Craig as Bond on the big screen one last time , even if the movie around him is seldom as good as he is . But then that 's always been the case with the Craig Bond movies , with the sole exception of Casino Royale , the first and still the best of the five . Craig put his imprint on the character from the get-go : Like any good 007 , he showed he could rock a tuxedo and toss off double-entendres with ease . But he was also a colder , broodier James Bond closer to Sean Connery than Roger Moore , but with an aching vulnerability all his own . With this Bond , it was personal : We saw just how anguished he could be when he lost the love of his life , Vesper Lynd , a tragedy that haunted him over the next few movies and continues to haunt him in this one . As No Time to Die begins , Bond has been retired from active MI6 duty for some time and started a new life with Madeleine Swann , played by Lea Seydoux . But he ca n't shake the memory of Vesper , and before long tragedy tears Bond and Madeleine apart , setting a somber tone that 's beautifully captured by Billie Eilish 's opening theme song . Five years later , Bond is bumming around Jamaica when a fresh criminal conspiracy convinces him to end his retirement . The plot is too busy and complicated to summarize at length : Let 's just say it involves a deadly plague of DNA-targeting nanobots that could wipe out millions of people worldwide , which feels just close enough to our real-life pandemic to suggest why the studio might have opted to hold the picture back a year . That said , nothing about No Time to Die feels especially timely or urgent . It 's the usual assembly of Bond movie cliches , which is nothing to complain about , of course , since cliches the gadgets , the one-liners , the martinis , the sex are the lifeblood of this series . But more than once during No Time to Die , I found myself wondering if those familiar beats could n't have been hit with a bit more panache .

55,BKG_Doc6_No_Time_to_Die,"James Bond has always had a loose relationship with continuity . The secret-agent character , originally written by Ian Fleming , has been played by six actors over the past six decades , usually with the slightest wink to the audience after each transition . `` This never happened to the other fella , '' George Lazenby quipped in his one appearance as Bond , joking about the man he had replaced , Sean Connery . Not until Daniel Craig assumed the role , in 2006 's Casino Royale , did the series implicitly acknowledge the recasting , having Craig play Bond at the beginning of his career , a rookie spy earning his license to kill . Now , in No Time to Die , Craig 's fifth and final outing in the part , the franchise has done something equally revolutionary : give Bond a firm send-off . That 's not to say this is the end of the character ; the standard , defiant title card follows the credits , reading james bond will return , and the rumor mill about who will succeed Craig will surely spin into high gear next year . But most Bond actors over the decades left on a bum note . Connery 's Diamonds Are Forever , Roger Moore 's A View to a Kill , and Pierce Brosnan 's Die Another Day are arguably the worst films for their respective stars . It seemed as if Craig might bow out similarly in 2015 's disappointing Spectre , but No Time to Die works hard to clean up that film 's narrative mess , take stock of Craig 's tenure , and give the actor ample space for a fond farewell . It 's ambitious , sprawling , and sometimes shockingly counter to tradition for the series . But it 's also hugely effective : In offering real closure for the first time , No Time to Die sheds Bond 's mystique . It cements Craig 's legacy of playing Bond not just as a reliable institution , but also as a flawed human No Time to Die brings in a new director , Cary Joji Fukunaga , who wrote the script alongside the Bond mainstays Neal Purvis and Robert Wade , and Fleabag 's Phoebe Waller-Bridge . Bond 's first spectacular action sequence sees him visiting the grave of Vesper Lynd , Eva Green 's character from Casino Royale , whose death seemed to harden his heart to future romantic commitment . Indeed , much of No Time to Die 's emotional arc is invested in whether Bond can open up to Madeleine Swann ( played by Lea Seydoux ) , returning as his love interest from Spectre . Returning love interests ? Callbacks to past regrets ? Bond opening his heart to anyone ? This all sounds almost sacrilegious given his typical love-them-then-leave-them approach to women . Part of the key to Bond 's appeal has been his unchangeability",BKG_Doc6_No_Time_to_Die,BKG,Action,Positive,No_Time_to_Die
56,BKG_Doc7_No_Time_to_Die,"As Robert Graves wrote when he was ridding himself of stultifying English conventions , a generation before Sir Ian Fleming created James Bond : Goodbye to all that . Watching the final Daniel Craig iteration of 007 settle his affairs and get right with his emotions in `` No Time to Die , '' the most plainly divided of all the Bond movies nostalgic-retro , depressive-ashen , frisky-jokey , apocalyptic-sentimental one ca n't help but think a dozen hyphenated things at once . Let 's start with : Good-great job , Mr. Craig . Fleming 's visual conception of the chain-smoking , borderline-alcoholic intelligence agent with the `` cruel '' mouth may have been modeled on Hoagy Carmichael , as various characters in Fleming 's stories noted . But Craig was his own guy , surly , hunky , bat-eared and unpredictably coiled . He was the Bond the franchise needed , when it needed it : grave , full of tamped-down , barely concealed rage , a man introduced in `` Casino Royale '' ( 2006 ) in swim trunks that said HELLO ! but enough of a broken figure in need of healing to justify the long , therapeutic goodbye of this movie . Here 's the official review , for your eyes only , never to be shared , though of course we should never say never again . `` No Time to Die '' was directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga , who made the superb `` Beasts of No Nation '' ( now on Criterion ) . Working from a script he cowrote with several writers , including `` Fleabag '' creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge , this is an autumnal spy blockbuster of no fixed mood or attitude but a pleasingly expensive air of life on an unlimited expense account . Somehow that oscillating tone becomes this film 's strength , not its weakness . It 's overlong ( the longest Bond yet , at 163 minutes ) , and Rami Malek 's murmuring supervillain is n't really much . Malek is a fine , distinctive presence but he 's never been much for the pace of a scene . The movie , luckily , has enough rhythmic and emotional change-ups to compensate . I like `` No Time to Die '' partly for reasons I really like director Rian Johnson 's `` The Last Jedi '' : It 'll enrage the purists who live in constant fear their adolescent memories are about to be destroyed . It starts on a winding road on the Italian coastline , with Bond and his steady , Dr. Madeleine Swann ( Lea Seydoux ) , on a personal farewell mission . Bond 's great love Vesper Lynd lies buried nearby and Bond is visiting her grave before he and Swann can move on to whatever 's next . Cozying up to a daughter of SPECTRE : never wise . Oh , James !

57,BKG_Doc8_No_Time_to_Die,"Nothing can truly kill James Bond , but the COVID-19 pandemic certainly tried , delaying the release of No Time to Die , the MI6 agent 's 25th official feature-film outing , by a year and a half . In an unexpected twist , Bond 's latest boasts a trace of timely resonance , courtesy of a story that hinges on a nefarious plot to infect the world with a lethal contagion . What 's most surprising about Daniel Craig 's fifth and final go-round as 007 , however , is its general lack of urgency or excitement . A workmanlike swan song that never approaches the highs of Casino Royale or Skyfall , it sends the star out with a whimper rather than a bang . Directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga with all the enthusiasm of an adolescent eating a plateful of Brussels sprouts , No Time to Die ( in theaters Oct. 8 ) is primarily notable for failing to stage a single rousing set piece . Bond swings from a cord off a bridge , engages in some car chases , pilots a glider that transforms into a submarine , and shoots a lot of anonymous henchmen , none of which registers as the least bit remarkable . The fact that the film 's climax involves Bond gunning down disposable adversaries in a chemical plant in sub- John Wick fashion says a lot about this installment 's level of creativity . Whereas Martin Campbell ( Casino Royale ) and Sam Mendes ( Skyfall ) found ways to provide Craig with memorably extravagant and pulse-pounding showstoppers , Fukunaga and his three co-screenwriters fall back on generic action and drama at every available opportunity . Though it plays a familiar globetrotting game ( sending Bond to locales as varied as Italy , Jamaica , Cuba , and London ) and has been shot with IMAX in mind , No Time to Die is devoid of imposing scale or import . Having felled half-brother Ernst Stavro Blofeld ( Christoph Waltz ) and retired to a quiet life with psychiatrist Madeleine Swann ( Lea Seydoux ) , Bond finds that letting go of the past is tough , particularly when he 's nearly blown up while trying to say farewell to former flame Vesper Lynd ( Eva Green ) at her tomb . Bond comes to believe that Madeleine is behind this unsuccessful assassination and promptly dumps her . Five years later , he 's brought back into the spy-business fold by CIA buddy Felix Leiter ( Jeffrey Wright ) , who wants him to retrieve scientist Valdo Obruchev ( David Dencik ) , who 's been kidnapped by Spectre baddies interested in wielding the deadly DNA-targeting bioweapon that Obruchev secretly developed for M ( Ralph Fiennes ) and MI6 . Bond thus gains a new mission that puts him at odds with his former employers , who 've handed over his 007 designation to a new agent ( Lashana Lynch",BKG_Doc8_No_Time_to_Die,BKG,Action,Negative,No_Time_to_Die
58,BKG_Doc9_No_Time_to_Die,"Not long into No Time to Die , James Bond ( Daniel Craig ) makes a trip to Cuba to infiltrate a swanky party thrown by some of the world 's most dangerous criminals . This being a Bond movie , his local contact is a gorgeous young woman ( Ana de Armas ) , who greets him wearing a dress slit down to the navel and up to the hip , and , Bond being Bond , he turns on the wolfish charm . There 's all of human existence to protect from some imminent , as-yet-undefined threat , but that does n't mean there 's no time for a quickie . She leads him into a small room , shuts the door , and immediately begins to unbutton his shirt , at which point even James Bond ca n't quite believe his luck . But when his innuendoes turn into overt propositions , the young woman who , it turns out , is just trying to get him into his tuxedo , shoots him a look that says , unmistakably , um , gross . With No Time to Die , Craig becomes the longest-running Bond in the franchise 's history , and thanks to a yearlong delay , the movie also achieves the more dubious milestone of equaling the longest gap between it and the previous entry . For reasons other than the doings of randy superspies , 2015 's Spectre feels impossibly distant , which makes this one 's decision to begin virtually where the last one left off seem almost like an act of magical thinking . ( Would n't we all like to pretend the last six years never happened ? ) But after an opening sequence that splits Bond from his leading Spectre lady , Madeleine ( Lea Seydoux ) , the movie jumps forward five years , as if as a reminder that for this particular iteration of the character , time actually does exist . For previous Bonds , years were as interchangeable as women , and as easily forgotten . But Craig 's Bond has a past , not just a backstory , although lord knows the movies have loaded him down with plenty of that , but a sense of something that weighs on him . ( He 's the first Bond since Sean Connery who looks like he 's been in a fight , and the only one who looks like the other guy might have got in a few licks . ) That means he ages , and that means that he can grow old . As the plot kicks into gear in earnest , Bond has been living off the grid for years , and even his old comrades presume that he 's dead .

59,BKG_Doc10_No_Time_to_Die,"Perhaps it is only fitting that , at the end of a particularly circuitous journey , one would get a little emotional . There was such sentiment in a video of actor Daniel Craig , choking back tears as he thanked crew members after wrapping on his final James Bond film , No Time to Die . And there it is in Bond himself , and just about everything surrounding him in Cary Joji Fukunaga 's 165-minute film , an epic that does n't so much trot the globe as trudge solemnly across it , laden with loss and life 's accumulated weariness . Does that sound fun ? The powers that be sure hope it does , as No Time to Die finally arrives in theaters on October 8 after many COVID-related delays . It is perhaps the great theater-exclusive tentpole dream of the fall , that eager audiences wanting to zip off on another suave adventure while also saying goodbye to an entire generation 's James Bond will flock to cineplexes and help revive a flagging industry . I 'm sure those audiences will indeed show up . What they will make of the film after they 've seen it , though , is another question . At such considerable length , No Time to Die has room to be several films in onepart rollicking caper and part character drama of the sort set up in 2012 's Skyfall , a film that made a deeper mythological figure out of our Etonian super spy , long admired for merely tossing off a quip or two and getting his daring job done . When Skyfall came out , earning over a billion dollars at the box office , it was to many an exciting reimagining of a creaky character ( the fruit of a transformation begun , of course , with 2006 's Casino Royale , Craig 's first outing in the tux ) . He was given actual context and history and pathos that felt more in line with the blockbuster mores and customs of the day . But then the trilogy became a quadrilogy with 2015 's tiresome , extraneous Spectre , certainly a big hit but not the rumbling cultural event that was Skyfall . Craig could n't go out on that sour note . Thus we have No Time to Die , the definitive -they swear ! conclusion of Craig 's run and , presumably , the end of this particular stylistic Bond era . That 's a lot of weight to put on one movie 's shoulders , and yet No Time to Die , written by Fukunaga , Neal Purvis , Robert Wade , and Phoebe Waller-Bridgehappily adds even more . We 've got existential reckoning , ancient grudges , child endangerment , and death that actually matters . This is very serious stuff , to a definite fault .

60,VGI_Doc1_Taxi,"I normally avoid action films and car chases bore me , but I watched Taxi on a friend 's recommendation and have to say that it is one of the best films I 've seen in a long time . Everything about it is pure class which may be something to with it being French . The premise of the film is beautifully simple - a speed-freak taxi driver Daniel and an inept policeman have to work together to catch some bank robbers . The relatively trivial nature of their mission is the perfect vehicle ( excuse the pun ) for the ever-so French humour of the script . They are n't out to save the world or stop evil for the good of all mankind ( as is too often the case in American action films ) , but both want to stop the criminals for their own purely selfish reasons . In this setting the witty banter of the heroes is perfectly natural , especially compared with the cliched one-liners said in the face of doom found in most films in this genre.A mismatched pair of heroes is pretty much standard in action films ( Lethal Weapon being the most famous case ) , but here is works well as they manage to be more than just stereotypes and are believable even if their circumstances are n't . Both characters come across as real people , flawed , but likeable , especially the roguishly charming Daniel.Despite being an action film , special-effects are kept to a minimum and although they are a large part of the film , the high speed car sequences are never self-indulgent , peppered with humour and brilliantly directed so as to hold the attention of even of the most `` seen it all before '' viewers ( i.e . me ) . All in all a refreshing change from Hollywood comedy or action films and one which I would happily watch again and again . This film is one of the best action-movies I 've seen for the last few years . I want entertainment and that 's what I get . The car-chases are really intense , you really get the expression that the speed is up . The humor might not be intelligent , but it 's still a lot better than what you see in the majority of American action-movies . What really makes this movie a banger is the sound-track : French hip-hop at its very best . Like the genre or not , it really fits well into the movie . `` Gentlemen , start your engines ... '' A film that you would have loved to watch as a kid but as been made for grown ups its laden with some sexy humour , loads of action and no worry about complex plots or overbearing drama .

It is an extremely well made film , It really has great script , which Luc Besson mastered and made this action comedy movie , just a fun to watch . I 'm not a fan boy , but i do love this film . Although I do know that it is hard to find an English Dub , I enjoyed this film in Russian . Russians tend to dub more French films then America . The story is of a useless cop who freezes when he gets behind a car 's wheel , and then on the other side we have Daniel who was a pizza legend driver of scooters until he finally got his taxi license and decided to become a taxi driver , as the two meet in a lucky circumstances Daniel is forced work for Emilien . The two become friends in their struggle of having a social life and form a bond . The film has great chemistry between all of the actors , and incredible driving scenes . in my opinion better filmed and better executed then the Fast and the furious films . If you get the chance to see this film either Subbed or Dubbed . Taxi is exactly what it sets out to be - fast and funny . The somewhat pathetic police inspector is complemented well by the wisecracking , fast-driving taxi driver whom he is forced to work with ( because he himself ca n't drive at all ) . Some may say that the movie has to much gas and not enough brains - so what ? That 's exactly what the movie was supposed to be , and it 's done well . It provides laughs and action , and if you speak french , the french language version is actually a lot better and wittier than the subtitles . The soundtrack has some top-rate french hip-hop artists , and was a big seller in its own right . I just wish the movie was easier to find in video stores . Luc Besson has succeeded yet again to produce a hilarious comedy and an action filled sequence from a subject that is not quite new . The outrageous characters , witty dialogues , and the excellent production provide great entertainment . I went into the theater without any expectations since I heard nothing of this movie before I watched it , and left with a big smile stamped on my face ... I highly recommend it to anyone , although I think that the younger generation and particularly males will have the most fun . Taxi is one of my favourites due to its `` roadmovie-style '' .

62,VGI_Doc3_Taxi,"In my opinion this is the one of the best mainstream French movies in a long while . I know that for many of us subtitled French movies are not regular choices . The film did n't break any UK/USA box office records ( presumably as people were put of by its subtitles and french origins ) which is a real shame . Well why should you give this one a try ? Here goes ... The movie was written and produced by Luc Besson , director of such films as Leon ( aka The Professional in the USA ) , The Fifth Element ( with Bruce Willis ) , Kiss of the Dragon ( with Jet Li and Bridget Fonda ) and Nikita ( aka La Femme Nikita in the USA ) . The story follows Daniel , a moped pizza delivery guy who has worked to fulfill his dream of becoming a Marseilles taxi driver . He has tuned and tweaked his own taxi into something a little special ... something a little out of the ordinary ... I do n't want to give the game away so I 'll leave it there ! The film is a fast paced thrill ride that crosses the boundaries of action , comedy , romance , farce and buddy movie amongst many other genres . The characters are likeable , the humour is quick and snappy and the driving is fast and furious ( some of the best chases seen on screen for a few years ) . After a short while you barely realise that you are reading the subtitles . The storyline may not be particularly original but it is well executed overall . The soundtrack is funky and fits in perfectly with the film . It 's not Shakespeare , but it never sets out to be Shakespeare . So if you are looking for a nicely shot film , suitable for just about anyone , give it a try . If this had been in English , it would have been top 250 material , I kid you not . But since it happens to be in a 'foreign ' language , people will complain about 'reading ' the movie or 'bad dubbing ' . I do n't speak French but I appreciate it very much when Besson let 's his actors speak their mother 's tongue . It 's a better language than American English . Enough of my rant . Let 's talk about the movie . The acting is very good . The characters are well thought out and do what you 'd expect them to do . The story is very good , with a simple idea and brilliant execution . It 's a comedy , and you 'll never get bored .

People usually are sceptic about watching films witch are n't from Hollywood , that 's why many great French comedies were remade in Hollywood , but I think that people should give it a try , maybe those movies are made on a lower budged , but that does n't mean they are less entertaining . Taxi is a typical French action movie . It has a lot of action sequences ( in this part only shoot out 's and car chases and they were all great ) , some comedy , style , great music and everything else what a great action flick needs . I was not expecting a lot from this film to be honest . Luc Besson is not a name that inspires that much confidence given the terrible Leon , lacklustre Fifth Element and excreble Joan of Arc but this is an absolute humdinger of a movie for its genre . Clearly Besson is happier with just a pen than when in overall control because this film excels in every way . The script is great : both packed with one liners and tightly ( and often hilariously ) plotted . I confess could only keep up with the subtitles - the characters talk like machine guns if you 're not used to colloquial French - but the dialogue really sparkled . The cast of unknowns are also spot on . Samy Naceri and Frederic Diefenthal are a great double act as Daniel the savvy , sexy speed demon taxi driver and Emilien the handsome but hapless non-driving cop . Marion Cotillard is drool inducing as Daniel 's long suffering girlfriend Lilly and the aptly named Bernard Farcy is excellent as the prejudiced police chief with a penchant for stupid operation monikers . The film is very tightly shot with plenty of action ( car chases and the like ) but the witty script and great performances make it far more than your standard actioner . It also boasts a kicking soundtrack and some great set pieces . I can not overemphasise how impressive this film is and it 's a crying shame that , being French , it is n't more widely appreciated . Recently I had rewatching this film . It is great film what attracting attention viewer from start and until the end . Incredible stunt tricks , memorable characters and interesting plot make `` Taxi '' is cinematic masterpiece . In this film have everything : drive , humor , romance and even cool music .

This genre is entirely aimed at a young male 's middle regions , it 's not to be appreciated with the brain . Sadly , `` Taxi '' is lacking even in those respects : Angelina Jolie is nowhere in sight , the car chases are so impossible as to be comedic rather than jaw-dropping , and the dreamy cars replaced by ... wait for it ... a Peugeot . Yes , you read that right . No V8 Vantage , no XKR , no F50 , no GT40 , not even an Elise or 911 ; just a Peugeot . A Peugeot that , on the press of a button , sprouts spoilers everywhere , like the world 's tackiest Transformer . I 'd rather walk . Good acting would look out of place in this movie , so let 's be thankful for the main cast 's sub-par performance . Finally , the music . Well , it 's all french hip-hop , which , just like the movie , is an ersatz of the American equivalent . Saw it yesterday , 22 years after it was made and if it was any good , it did n't age wel . It is dumb , sexist , not funny , not thrilling , totally predictable and totally forgetable . I was surprised that they bothered to make sequels . This film apart from it 's weird and not very funny french humour , is nothing but cars transforming into SUPERcars ... Something which might have caught my interest if I was 6-8 years old , which I 'm not ... I must admit there are some nice car-chases but I 'd watch Jackie Chan 's `` Thunderbolt '' instead ... Daniel the taxi driver is no Corben Dallas , but is ok when you ca n't get the real thing . Some good jokes , good acting and a lot of action . The plot eventually gets too silly even for a comic book story like this . Luc Besson used some of the same ideas in Subway , which is a better movie . Childish comedy , Predictable and a million times told story . To sum up ... action and stunts that make the Fast & Furious saga seem a documentary about car capabilities . I stil can not understand how they 've produce 4 sequels of this disaster .",VGI_Doc6_Taxi,VGI,Action,Negative,Taxi

If the trend for cinema is like this then i 'm never watching another film as long as i live , which hopefully wont be very long if this is supposed to be entertainment . If you do like this film do n't tell anyone for fear of being attacked . Actually , cancel that , raise your hand and let us clear you from the gene pool so that we can make the earth a better place . The acting is on a par with the worst Arnie has to offer and the plot is so thin it makes Jodie Kidd look like Big Daddy ( God rest his soul ! ) . I just wish i had seen this film sooner so that i could have warned you all to stay well clear . This is clearly a film for all the Chavs out there that aspire to this kind of souped up peugeot lifestyle . Do n't forget to put your Burberry caps on first folks ! Apart from that , its great ! Unrealistic . Flick a switch and your car transforms into an F1 beater . Inane plot . No human beings behave like this . Not funny . Pathetic instead . Only the token sex-object girl could act . Anything good ? Only the ( pointless ) crashes were well done . If , after the first 10 minutes , you are thinking `` maybe it gets better ? '' - it does n't - turn it off now ! I tried hard to like this movie , especially knowing that French comedies are usually fun to watch and funny . There was no fun here , though . I was not annoyed either , but just moderately bored from the beginning to the end . Shallow , rather childish humor , lots of car crashes , and that 's about it . Disappointed is the best word to describe this movie . A pleasant but somewhat over-hyped buddy-action-comedy from France that became a huge hit , especially in Europe , and spawned three ( to this date ) sequels . To be sure , it has its virtues : likable characters , impressive stunt driving , stunning car crashes worthy of rewind & replay , and some good laughs . But it 's just too fluffy to justify all the hype about it . The comedy rarely makes the leap from `` mildly funny '' to `` explosively funny '' . And the bad guys - a gang of fast-driving German bank robbers - are basically faceless and you can barely tell them apart . In any case , I 'm suspecting that the sequels - with the set-up of Daniel and Emilien 's friendship already done",VGI_Doc7_Taxi,VGI,Action,Negative,Taxi
67,VGI_Doc8_Taxi,"When I rented this movie , I expected it to be as silly and juvenile as many French comedies are , but hoped that a lot of well shot spectacular car chases would make it worth watching . Unfortunately too much time was spent trying to tell a story or build up jokes which one could feel coming from miles away . There are in fact very few car chases in this film , so if you are into that you 'd better watch `` Ronin '' instead ( which is n't a good movie either , but it contains a really spectacular high speed pursuit on the French motorways ) . Furthermore , the unplausability of the story got annoying after a while . Normally I do n't mind a willing suspension of disbelief , but the writers really did n't succeed in making it acceptable that a gang of German bankrobbers , who always use the same red Mercedeses and who announce which bank they are going to attack , ca n't get caught by the Marseille police force . The young cast is quite enjoyable to watch , but that does n't compensate for the overall childishness of this product . It is in stark contrast to Emilien , who it is enforced early on can not drive at all when he smashes into a shop front during a test , but this twinned with the fact he still lives at home ; does not have a girlfriend , a trait that is enforced through repeated failed attempts to 'woo ' female police officer Petra ( Wiklund ) , and generally maintains an odd relationship with his mother , one ingredient of which sees her make snacks for him to take on his journeys . The reason all this is playing out is due to the aforementioned German bank robbers , a laughing ; cackling ; mocking ; technically efficient ; mostly Aryan group of thieves whom have robbed banks across mainland Europe and now target France . This plot device is obviously absolute nonsense , as there 's no reason French SWAT teams can not surround a bank which is in the process of being robbed and apprehend them . The bringing in of a nationalistic drive the French 'ought ' to possess when the police chief mentions the Second World War is unnecessary , France being next in the firing line following banks in Holland and Belgium , two nations that were occupied as well as Italy whom were allied with Germany during The War , having already been invaded and robbed . Taxi 's clear attempt to appeal to audiences of an overseas nature is evident in all the crashing and shooting and chasing , for sure ; but its guiltiest example is when Daniel , who begins with a pizza delivery job but promotes himself to position of a cab driver , takes his first fare home after they 've spent a day",VGI_Doc8_Taxi,VGI,Action,Negative,Taxi
68,VGI_Doc9_Taxi,"I had expected this movie to impress me with good action scenes , and probably some good humor too ; I was heavily disappointed . I knew it was about cars , but come on , nothing else ? The movie consists of scene after scene involving cars racing . It might as well have taken place at a race track . The humor mainly consists of the main character constantly being kept from having sex with his girlfriend . The action scenes consist of a lot of people shooting , without it ever being very clear what the hell they 're shooting at . Now , I 'm not a big racing movie fan , in fact , I mostly hate movies that involve a lot of car racing , but some good movies involving cars have impressed me ( The Matrix Reloaded , for example ) , but I must admit , the car scenes in this movie were simply nothing special . The plot is instantly forgettable . The characters are annoying . The stunts are nothing that is n't seen hundreds of times before . The movie is in no way entertaining , impressive , or just mildly worth your time . Skip this one , no matter how big a racing movie fan you are . I do n't recommend this movie to anyone , unless they are so into cars that they ca n't stand the thought of not having seen every single movie involving them . Whatever problems to do with the strange relationship France seem to have going on between youth and state still manages to worm its way into what is , on the surface , harmless and daft entertainment . No surprise then , that the youth turns out to be more qualified to do the task of going after these criminals than the state are . The film likes these characters , enjoys having them goad the enemy and have them banter to one another about whatever ; but it likes the cars even more so much so in fact , that the process of transforming a bog-standard Peugeot into a souped-up and ready for action juggernaut is a process of distinct fetishistic transition : as Daniel goes through all the motions of flipping a buttoned turntable ; raising the suspension ; unveiling a spoiler ; pushing out a bumper ; the removing of one steering wheel and then the glorious re-attachment of another . A running joke is that Daniel finds time for a very small amount of foreplay with his girlfriend Lilly without ever actually following through with sex ; his frustrations relieved by going through a set of familiar motions with his car before rampaging off at top speed , this after completing the transformation of the phallic automobile from natural and as you see it , into something else capable of maximum drive .

69,VGI_Doc10_Taxi,"A devil may care ex pizza delivery guy becomes a taxi driver and ends up driving a cop around ( who ca n't get his license ? ) to help him capture some German bank robbers who keep managing to avoid being caught . Whilst the car chase elements are incredibly well done - and make up a large chunk of the film , this is dreadfully silly with a script that makes little sense . Granted it is very tongue in cheek and is more interested in car crashes than anything else , but a little tightening of the plot would have done no harm . A bit like Fast and Furious vs Terence Hill and Bud Spencer , it 's ok if you 're in the mood for such very undemanding stuff . Gerard Pires ' 1998 film Taxi seems to have been more inspirational than it deserves to have been , with three sequels since its inception ; a woeful 2004 American remake plus , from what I 've read , an Indian film named Dhoom which supposedly somewhat borrows from the overall narrative of Taxi . The film is n't a crushing disappointment , but for an 86 minute sprint to still feel like it outstays its welcome is not good , and the film is not the achievement everyone else seems to think it is . Penned by Luc Besson , he now of innumerable Americanised , rather daft French language films about not very much , the film is nothing more than an afterthought ; a screenplay pumped out over the course of a month and sufficing on basic technical levels of kinetic action and would-be funny buddy genre banter . It 's over the top and rather annoying . Taxi tells the story of a well off job-wise but clumsy , down and out cop named Emilien ( Diefenthal ) and a relatively poor , working class cab driver named Daniel ( Naceri ) who 's actually at the top of his game in his own little world . The two come together when cop Emilien hitches a ride in Daniel 's cab but books him for haring down the roads at a dangerous speed . Forced into working for the police in taking down some German bank-robbers through threat of a license ban , Daniel must subside into aiding . The distinction between the police and your average working French schlub is more prominent than needs be in Taxi , with most of the police officers or figures of authority in Taxi coming across as either woefully incompetent ; easily duped or just generally somewhat pathetic it ranges from inept traffic cops , to stupid SWAT team members to blundering , elderly police captains . Indeed , taxi driver Daniel goes on at length at how he dislikes the police and enjoys insulting those that have signed up as well as taunting those who control speed traps .

70,DHB_Doc1_Taken,"To save you the time in either watching this film or reading my critique of it , here is a brief summary : This film is the worst film I have ever seen . This film is atrocious . This film is so unbelievably awful that all the writers , directors , producers and cast that worked on it should be sent to the Hague and tried for crimes against humanity . In the first chapter of this film , three facts are established : 1 . There exists a man . He 's pretty tough . 2 . He loves his daughter very much . 3 . Aforementioned daughter is going to Paris . In order to establish these three facts , which any competent writer or director could do in about ten minutes , the film takes over half an hour , quite possibly the most laborious half an hour in cinematic history . As soon as the daughter reaches Paris , she is of course kidnapped . Literally AS SOON . So there is a sudden escalation in pace that does n't leave the watcher thinking `` WOW , I did n't see that coming '' or `` Wo , what a skillful escalation in pace '' but simply `` OH Jesus Christ SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD THANK GOD THAT SOMETHING FINALLY HAPPENED ! '' This sudden plot `` twist '' of course makes the liberal mother and fat , short stereotypically wealthy stepfather look villainous and the absurdly-paranoid-to-the-degree-that-he-should-seek-professional-help father , who believes his daughter is safer in Los Angeles than Paris , becomes the all-knowing hero . And of course the CIA can detect from a tiny and poor-quality voice sample the hometown of any speaker . So we learn that the daughter has been kidnapped by an Albanian gang who intend to sell her into sex slavery . This is of course the point where the film ceases to be just bad and becomes outright immoral : people trafficking with the intent of prostitution is a real and tangible problem in Europe and indeed all over the world ( if you want to see an actually worthy film that deals with the issue I suggest `` Eastern Promises '' , `` Dirty Pretty Things '' or `` Spare Parts '' ) . Making it the subject of a Hollywood action film in which the American hero overcomes all the odds to rescue his daughter is insulting to those women who have actually been in this situation . Particularly appalling is the scant disregard that our `` hero '' shows for the wellbeing of any of the other women . It left me questioning `` is it supposed to be ironic ? morally ambiguous ? No , it 's just a film that chose a very sensitive and inappropriate subject for a formula-produced action movie . As the film continues we are given more and more ridiculous scenes that insult our intelligence . One particularly stupid",DHB_Doc1_Taken,DHB,Action,Negative,Taken
71,DHB_Doc2_Taken,"I 've never written a review before , but this movie angered me so much I felt it 's my civic duty to protest . The movie is so full of cliches and unrealistic it 's unbelievable it was made by adults . Apparently , we 're supposed to derive some kind of psychological gratification from the Freudian symbols of innocence , fatherly love , superhuman strength and righteousness . It actually reminds me of the fantasies I had when I was 8 . Here 's the plot : a rich , spoiled American virgin girl goes to Paris with a friend and gets abducted by Albanians and sold into sex slavery . Luckily , her daddy happens to be a ex-CIA agent and tracks them down effortlessly , kills and tortures them in a blood-curdling fashion and gets to his daughter just before she gets her throat slit by the evil ( yet also stupid looking so you can still feel good about yourself ) , toad-like sheik . On his way , daddy makes a such a spectacle of killing and torturing people that it makes you wonder whether anyone would take so much trouble if no third party was watching . He does n't even spare people who are innocent and are unlucky enough to get in his way . Like the wife of a French agent involved in the mess , whom Neeson shoots in the arm , because her husband refuses to give him information on St-Claire . ( Meanwhile , their kids have been tucked into bed 5 minutes ago yet they do n't seem to wake up . Yep , totally . ) All the circumstances are miraculously in Neeson 's favor . His daughter is talking to him on the phone when she gets abducted . ( otherwise , how would he know ? Most victims of sex slavery are poor East European girls who do n't have cell-phones , which would be too boring ) . Also , she 's standing in the bathroom from where she can see her friend being abducted first , so daddy has enough time to instruct her how to hide and to shout out the details of their complexion while being dragged away ( at which she miraculously succeeds , despite her panic and the struggle she puts up ) . Also , multiple men can apparently easily get into a hotel room and abduct two girls , but Neeson has to use Spiderman skills to get inside . Well , thank God the bas relief of the wall was adjusted to his height exactly ; otherwise , the movie would have ended there . Another point that disturbed me very much is Neeson indifference to the scores of other girls who have been drugged and raped by Albanians .

How convenient that his ex-CIA buddies talk him into a bodyguard job where he heroically saves a no-name singer from being knifed to death . This allows him to not only prove his manhood and hand-to-hand combat skills , but also get the singer 's business card to give to his daughter slash aspiring pop princess ( not that she sings at all in the movie ) . Did I mention she just turned 17 and received of all things a PONY from her rich step-dad at the extravagant birthday party he threw for her ?

After all , they will be staying at her friend 's cousin 's house in Paris , and like most parents who send their underage daughters to Paris without adult supervision , she did n't call the cousins to ask about the arrangements .

Overall , this movie is ridiculously superficial and some of the worst acting/writing I 've ever seen . SUCH a horrible way to simplify such a serious and complicated issue . The writer had to have read a brief article about human trafficking and thought it was a great dramatic plot for a warm-hearted , happy ending action flick . while it did highlight some basic facts about trafficking and addresses the idea that ANYONE , even wealthy American girls , can be vulnerable , it does such an extreme injustice to actual victims/survivors . Unfortunately , a film that could have been effective in raising awareness about human trafficking , seems to have only reinforced ideology that young girls fall victim to these sort of operations because of their stupidity and all they need is a big strong man to come save them while they 're still `` pure '' . While her mother was extremely foolish in not taking any action to prepare her for the trip , the plot suggests that the daughter 's desire for independence led to her demise , succeeding in blaming the victim , as we tend to do in these situations . This movie could have so much better if they had created a situation where the daughter does everything right and still becomes a victim because of the extent of deception tactics used in this industry . The film is only 93 minutes ! It could have easily been extended to develop the plot and create a more plausible context . People who are trafficked are most often lured in by people they trust , not just some cute random at the airport telling them about a party . They should have ran with the plot of visiting museums and experiencing the culture of Europe and had her fall in love with some dreamy French guy or take some awesome job offer that turns out to be a trap . Take out one of the 5 car chase scenes and actually create a story ! They could have done SO much to create a strong female character who , despite her age , naivety and horrible situation , can be resilient and inspirational to other young women . Although the film did highlight typical experiences of trafficking victims such as forced drug use and repeated rape , as well as the complications of police corruption , they should have put a name or face to this experience rather than keeping the main character as the one who 's somehow spared with her virginity still in tact , days",DHB_Doc4_Taken,DHB,Action,Negative,Taken
74,DHB_Doc5_Taken,"Alright , I watched the movie about a few weeks ago and after seeing its ratings on IMDb I was expecting a really good action movie with good acting , a wholesome plot and obviously some amazing action . An 8.0 rating on IMDb means it 's equal to movies like 'The Matrix ' or 'Die Hard ' . Admittedly I 'm quite a big action fan , and I do understand the concept of it not being 'realistic ' . That 's what films are . They 're stories . Name me one movie that is completely realistic with no fantasy elements included and I 'll give you a million bucks . However when I saw this movie I was bored , embarrassed during some scenes at how atrocious it was , and I found it to be completely overrated . The action was slow , the cinematography was laughable , the acting from everyone except Neeson was very sub-par and I just felt disappointed . This is n't the action movie that would start a second renaissance , of course not . That 's not what I was expecting . I did n't think it 'd be anything more than a tour-de-force action film that was pure entertainment and silliness wrapped into a satisfying bubble . And honestly all I got was another second-rate action movie that 's not even worth the time and effort to watch unless you 're an extreme fan of the genre . I mean , during the scene where Neeson runs to the boat to get his daughter ... the camera cuts so many times and there 's about a million shots of his car in different angles that I completely forgot what was going on . That 's just an example of the many things I thought brought the movie down . I really do n't see how this film deserves the recognition it has received . I 've read the forums and people say `` well it 's an action flick ... you 're not supposed to take it seriously ! '' To that I say , why is n't Meet the Spartans in the IMDb 250 ? `` Well , it 's a parody flick , you 're not supposed to take it seriously '' ? The same principal applies . I 'm not trying to say the film is n't enjoyable because that 's down to tastes . I 'm just saying firstly ; film technicalities ( i.e . the direction , photography , musical score ) were atrocious and anyone with a basic knowledge of film and its production will recognize this . Secondly ; the acting of the support cast quite bad . Not Troll 2 bad , but still not something you 'd expect to see in a Liam Neeson movie .

75,DHB_Doc6_Taken,"Remember that time period when Hollywood used to release incredible action/thriller movies in an orderly pace ? Neither do I . What used to be a great trend to participate in back in the 90s ( Terminator 2 , Speed , Face-Off , The Rock , Con Air , Die Hard : With a Vengeance , Jurassic Park , The Mummy , The Matrix , Bad Boys , Under Siege , True Lies , Desperado , Clear and Present Danger , The Hunt for Red October , Patriot Games , Saving Private Ryan , Reservoir Dogs , Pulp Fiction ) suddenly became a distant memory , as the 2000s served very few decent Hollywood thrillers . Instead , we have to head overseas to find them . The 2000s consisted of many surprise-surprise excellent European actioneers with Hot Fuzz , Run Lola Run , Transporter , Kiss of the Dragon , Unleashed , and this superb flick . What happens nowadays is that Hollywood is scaling back its amount of action in order to make the extra money . In the first paragraph , 15 of the 19 movies I mentioned from the 90s were rated-R . In other words , they did not care about the PG-13 rating . Now , nearly every action movie must hit the PG-13 barrier . Even the fourth Die Hard was edited to not reach rated-R ( which was a Die Hard staple ) . To add to that movies from overseas ( like this one ) become edited in the States in order to hit the weaker and friendlier PG-13 . But do n't let that stop you . Taken is one of the most vicious PG-13 movies you 'll ever see , and you 'll enjoy every minute of its inability to cut back on the gruesomeness . It sounds barbaric , I know , but if you truly want to see what good action used to look like from the studios of Tinseltown , look no further than this excellent effort .

This time it 's about a retired spy ( Liam Neeson ) who searches all of Europe in order to find his kidnapped daughter ( Maggie Grace ) . He is given a small time frame , since his daughter is about to be sold into the deep , disgusting , and grueling underworld of sex trafficking . The movie starts off with Bryan , the spy , trying to adjust to a life without espionage , and the rest is just a wild roller coaster ride containing plentiful action scenes and fight after fight .

76,DHB_Doc7_Taken,"Since the entire plot of this film is given away in the masterfully delivered trailer , it 's not divulging anything to say that Taken is a modern-day revenge thriller . This presents an interesting experiment , actually . Considering that there are n't really any surprises to be found in Taken , beyond those we were offered in the pre-release snippet , are splendidly realized action sequences enough to carry this film ? The answer here is a resounding `` yes '' . Taken may be a simple film , but it 's not simplistic , and even though the first third of it is spent recapping what we knew going in , the second and third acts here deliver enough thrills and action to make this film riveting , even if we know exactly where it 's going . By setting the chase within the ultra-sleazy world of human trafficking , which we secretly hope is just a media creation , but know deep inside that this reprehensible and inhumane phenomenon is a reality , the film is propelled by a sense of urgency that is n't present in most revenge films . Liam Neeson 's daughter is n't `` Dead '' , she 's `` Taken '' , so his race against the ticking stopwatch tracking her probable fate provides enough tension to diffuse any disappointment in knowing exactly what 's going to happen here . The selling point here is how deftly Liam Neeson hacks his way through a bevy of Albanian baddies . Neeson is untested as an action star , but watching him maneuver his way through the sea of detritus here , we 're left hoping that he 's got a franchise in him . The film may not have the intricacies of the expertly crafted Bourne films ( although , like every action film made since Bourne appeared on the screen , the fight scenes here owe an obviously rich debt to Matt Damon 's antics ) , but the gritty and realistic path Neeson carves to get to his stolen daughter is sufficient to deliver the promise implied by the fantastic trailer . You do n't have to be a parent to understand and sympathize with Liam 's plight here , and there is a morbid but exhilarating sense of release in seeing the evil empire pay for its transgressions . Sometimes morally complex , ambiguous studies of man 's desire for revenge are too preachy to be entertaining . Taken does n't really care if you like Liam Neeson or wonder if he 's doing the right thing by flagrantly taking the law into his own hands ; the film just wants you to strap yourself in and enjoy the tidings as he hands out beat-downs all over Paris .

Despite his initial concerns about the trip , Mills allows her to go , later discovering that their actual plan is to travel around Europe following the band U2 .

78,DHB_Doc9_Taken,"The latest rescue-slash-revenge film to hit our screens , Taken , tries to walk the fine line between the two classic character archetypes - family man and ultimate badass . When the estranged seventeen year old daughter of a former spy ( Liam Neeson ) is kidnapped while holidaying overseas , her father must call upon his unique skill set in order to rescue her before she becomes lost to the Eastern-European slave trade . Liam Neeson kicking ass , and the potential of Maggie Grace showing a little - Taken had my full and undivided attention . As with the majority of films that limp onto the silver screen these days , everything seems to be a remake of a remake , or at the very least , a rehash of a tired idea . What separates a stock-standard retelling , from something that will stay with you longer than a half-masticated corn kernel stuck in your teeth , will almost certainly come down to the execution . Take a well-worn concept , freshen it up a little , but ultimately pull it off with dedication and skill . While Taken is by no means perfect , it is a prime example of a well-executed retelling . Let 's face it , the concept of a tough guys daughter getting kidnapped , and having said tough guy track her down , defeating a million bad guys in the process is hardly anything new . It 's basically the plot of Commando , or a dozen similar films for that matter . What Taken does well is to play on this tried-and-true formula ; it adds depth to the usual one-dimensional characters , and mixes it up in a giant cocktail shaker with stylistic elements that made films like The Bourne Identity such crowd-pleasers . Our first encounter with former spy , Bryan , is less than exhilarating . You 'd almost expect to see some incredible action set piece from his pre-retirement days , something that adequately introduces our brooding badass ' action hero qualifications - negative . What we get is the image of Bryan asleep on the lounge at home , a well-thumbed pamphlet for a karaoke machine on his lap . He 's after the perfect gift for his seventeen year old daughter 's birthday , and from what we can establish , he 's terribly indecisive when it comes to purchasing a present . It 's kind of amusing that after less than two minutes of screen time , we 've probably already experienced more character development and insight into our main character than we would experience in just about any other similar film .

79,DHB_Doc10_Taken,"It 's been just too long waiting for an action thriller that will knock my socks off , given too many bland attempts that left me wondering if the genre is too tired for my liking , with nothing left to wow . Then comes the Europa Corp team of Pierre Morel directing a Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen story , and Taken now ranks as one of my contemporary favourites for its simple story executed with so much style and gripping pace , that you 'll be left breathless by the time the end credits roll . The trailer had one of the best monologues that I 'm sure would have put many in the theatres , and probably be representative of the film . You have a stoic looking Liam Neeson as a father who tells the stranger at the end of the other line the conditions that the game will be played in , with perhaps bluff calling against bluff , only for the challenge and gauntlet to be thrown . From then on it 's a non-stop adrenaline rush because this daddy happens to be a top ex-covert operative for the US government , so the bad guys essentially have chosen a wrong opponent to play the game with . The story worked well in dipping into some familiar fears , where daddy 's little girl Kim ( Maggie Grace ) tells her dad lie after lie so as to cover up her tracks in wanting to do things she knows he would disapprove of . Such as , in this case , going on a tour of museums in Paris supposedly , rather than letting him know of her intent of being a groupie with friend Amanda ( Katie Cassidy ) chasing U2 all over Europe . Some may dismiss this fear as paranoia , but I think that heightened sense of awareness is a by product occupational hazard , and it 's always better to err on the side of caution . For any parent who are confident of their kid 's conduct , there is absolutely no guarantees that their kids ' friends would toe the same line , and there are often those who are magnets for trouble due to their thrill seeking . As is in this case where you see supposed safeguards to lower risks being systematically peeled away . With his reluctant consent and lessons being thrown in on very simple survival tips ( that would even serve well in real life ) , things still go wrong according to Murphy , and Liam Neeson 's Brian has to race against time in finding a needle in the perennial haystack , relying on contacts and skills built over the years in carrying out government missions of prevention to save masses , now to put them into something more personal when addressing what could be any parent 's worst nightmare , in having their daughters sold to the sex",DHB_Doc10_Taken,DHB,Action,Positive,Taken
80,SHR_Doc1_Inception,"I 'm nearly at a loss for words . Just when you thought Christopher Nolan could n't follow up to `` The Dark Knight '' , he does it again , delivering another masterpiece , one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years . Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird , but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just ca n't help watching and wondering what will happen next . That is a real powerful skill a director has . No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him , he is THAT good of a director , and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film , no matter what the film is about , is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick , Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan . He is , undoubtedly , one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history . Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime . He has the ability to seduce our eyes , ears and most importantly , mind , and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast . Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time . And yes , it is similar to the excellent anime film `` Paprika '' in the whole `` invading dreams '' plot , but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time , it 's either all-visuals-no-smarts ( `` G.I . Joe '' , `` Transformers '' ) or the exact opposite ( `` Doubt '' , `` Invictus '' ) . In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.Although having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio ( Warner Bros ) , this film is a very personal film for Nolan , he wrote the film as well as directing it , and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan 's perplexing , increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up . Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film . This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher , rather it is a film for thinkers . Honestly I ca n't explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers . Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience .

81,SHR_Doc2_Inception,"This has to be Christopher Nolan 's best film to date the visuals , characters & story are all amazing . But while it 's really good this film is n't perfect their are some flaws but the flaws can be overlooked like for example their is a lot of exposition in the film but it 's necessary since it their to explain the concept of the movie since it involves Dreams which is a weird concept that any normal person would be asking questions about like how do they work ? , can this happen ? , what happens if I do this ? , etc . The film is super entertaining their is not a time you will feel bored or feeling like your time is being wasted like the dreams they never get through what 's the point of it existing but instead it always begins right in the middle of it . Like in the beginning of the movie we do n't have scene of Cobb & Arthur arriving at the party , talk with the other guests , planning a meeting with Saito which finally establishes why we are here . It skips all that & instead has us learning that Saito is in a dream & that he has a secret that 's worth stealing right away before we learn all the other info first since we do n't start off in the beginning of the dream we start off in the middle of it which has us constantly wondering what happened before this ? how did they get into this situation ? whenever they enter a dream which gives it one of the most thrilling movie openings of all time & leave anyone watching with excitement on what 's going to happen for the rest of the movie . In the first dream our characters kidnap Fisher which has them having to deal with his security , in the second dream they are already trying to get Fisher to join the team all while the environment of the dream is being moved around with due to gravity of the car chase , In the third dream we are scouting out a military base which has Fishers secret the team has been looking for . Notice how their is no filler here it 's all just what we want to see it 's made to make sure we do n't get bored . But this does sorta make Fisher seem like a boring character that is just a tool for the characters goals but that 's where your wrong since they have Earmes infiltrate his legal team but they skip all the boring interview steps & instead put us right in the moment we want to see he we see the relationship Fisher & his father have right away these scenes are also connected with a clear reason & motivation for us being here so it does n't feel random or out of nowhere",SHR_Doc2_Inception,SHR,Action,Positive,Inception
82,SHR_Doc3_Inception,"Inception is truly one of a kind . A concept which has long gestated in Christopher Nolan 's mind , his eye for drama mixed with his large scale sensibilities ring true in Blockbuster season making Inception a true original in the sea of reboots , remakes and sequels . To try and explain Inceptions many plot twists and incredibly intelligent arcs , would be a foolish task . As Nolan himself has been reluctant to . The best way to approach the film would be with an open mind , if you are prepared to be taken on a ride of a lifetime , then trust that you 100 % will . If Avatar was a seminal film in technology ( although coming out as a rather poor film , in my opinion ) , then Inception is seminal in it 's storytelling . With a 148 minute running time , you would expect a lot to take place , but what you would n't expect is the pace of it all . I did not think at one time in the film about how long was left . I was simply blown away by the depth in every single part of the film . If my enthusiasm for the storytelling aspect of the film has left you worried about the spectacle , then do n't worry . They are , as hinted in the trailer , incredible , looking real and unbelievable simultaneously . The most pleasing thing about the action set pieces , is that they are genuinely used to illustrate the story , rather than to blow stuff up a la Michael Bay . With this complex movie in it 's high concept , a stellar cast is needed . And Nolan as always , delivers with just that . This is vintage DiCaprio , perhaps only equalled in The Aviator , which is even more impressive as his role as Cobb in Inception is not a showy one , needing DiCaprio to be the constant at the centre of the film . And he pulls off Cobb 's emotional contradictions sublimely . The rest of the cast members all shine in parts of the films , Cillian Murphy shows off his usually non-existent tender side , Gordon-Levitt bottles his usual charm for his confidently reserved turn as the reliable Arthur , Watanabe is devilish as the seemingly ambiguous Saito , Page shows why she 's the next big female star and Tom Hardy revels in being the comic relief of the film compared to his recent turns as decidedly psychopathic characters . Overall , Nolan has indeed surpassed himself . He has created a world as expansive as his Gotham , a plot dwarfing the intricacies of Memento and one which blows The Prestige 's cinematic reveal out of the water . This is truly unmissable cinema . Revel in it , we 've still got to wait a whole two years before Batman 3",SHR_Doc3_Inception,SHR,Action,Positive,Inception
83,SHR_Doc4_Inception,"Many of us , not least those who populate the online world with movie reviews , observations and criticisms , are aware of Chris Nolan 's raw talent . Memento broke onto the screen a decade ago and provided us with a spectacle in story telling so rare that it dumbfounded us . Since then , Nolan has gained huge popularity with his revival of the Batman franchise , and even more so with the stunning Dark Knight - that still has yet to relinquish its grip on modern day cinema - with the genius of The Prestige sandwiched in between . None of this , however , could have quite prepared us for the spectacle that is INCEPTION . A script that has been worked on for over a decade , Nolan 's endeavours are inescapable in its pure complexity and brilliance - quite simply , one of the best film story lines audiences will have encountered in their lifetime . All this is supplemented superbly by the film 's ensemble cast - DiCaprio 's performance can not easily be done justice without seeing it . With this and Shutter Island , now must be the time for his first Oscar - he has asserted his place as truly one of the best actors currently working . All reviews will confirm that Joseph Gordon-Levitt , Tom Hardy and Ellen Page back his performance up superbly with well-worked turns . Inception 's action sequences play out wonderfully , being - along with the comic relief and back-stories - an integral part of the film 's unravelling , whilst we remain rooted to the film 's emotional stakes , which give immense purpose to the film 's complex and layered narrative . Our protagonist battles with both outer and inner demons in his quest for redemption . The unique concept of entering dreams offers the opportunity not only for a unique species of heist but also a way to dig deeper and deeper into one 's subconscious , and the ability to plant an idea which could define that person , or destroy them . In theaters around the world , Nolan uses his dynamic skill to plant an idea in our minds which together allows us to experience the very dream- share the film explores , one which will remain with us long after the film 's emotional climax . Inception is a cinema experience so audacious , so incredible , and in the end so gratifying , that it truly is unmissable , and will remain a benchmark for many filmmakers in years to come . 'Inception ' is a work of bold ambition . It is Nolan 's true masterpiece and one of the most original pieces of fiction ever put on film . The story , although multi-layered and complex , is incredibly engrossing and a wonder to behold on screen . The movie follows Dom Cobb ( DiCaprio ) as he leads a specialized team ,",SHR_Doc4_Inception,SHR,Action,Positive,Inception
84,SHR_Doc5_Inception,"I want this to be a very accurate and very constructive review of Inception , because it seems like people are either overly bashing it or overrating it out there and I do n't think that 's right . Personally , I would n't listen to any critic ( not even me ) when it comes to Inception because whether or not you like this movie depends completely on you . If you 're looking for deep and complex characters , I do n't know if Inception is for you . If you 're searching for an action film full of explosions and exciting car chases , I 'm still not sure if Inception is the right movie for you . But I could be wrong . Inception can not really be explained in words without giving much away because of the story 's complexity but I will tell you this .. Do n't go into Inception totally blind . Know that you 're about to watch a confusing movie that will make you think . You should also know certain aspects of the plot . For those aspects , I 'd go to the synopsis located at the bottom of this review because it is the best description you will find on the internet . Okay , now that I got that over with , here 's what I think about Inception : It is a truly mind blowing experience . Some scenes in this movie will leave you with your jaw dropped . I can assure you that some of the stuff that you will see in Inception is like nothing you 've ever seen before . With that being said , it does n't save Inception from falling short of a fantastic movie . This is n't a mindless action flick , but there is little emotion in some characters . When it comes to the main character , Cobb , you do have a lot of emotion and his character does have some depth . But when it comes to other characters like Ellen Page 's Ariadne , you 'll get almost no emotion at all . Some characters are only present in Inception to provide exposition or do something to allow the story to move forward . Because of that , it 's hard to praise Inception as a masterpiece . I should let you know though , just because the emotion is n't really there , every actor did the best they could with their role in the film . The other performances are a bit overshadowed by Leonardo DiCaprio 's , which was no doubt his best performance to date , but they were still great . And because I 'm on that subject , I should add that Watanabee and Hardy have very strong accents in this movie , that are a little hard to understand at times . Exspeaking of accents , Christopher Nolan 's directing was top notch . (",SHR_Doc5_Inception,SHR,Action,Positive,Inception
85,SHR_Doc6_Inception,"Contrary to the opinions of the deluded army of comic reading Nolan fanboy geeks who have descended on IMDb , Christopher Nolan has entirely and irrevocably disappeared up his own self inflated backside with this movie . I say The Emperors New Clothes because the director will sneer at anyone who does n't understand the film and he has thus created a perfect defence mechanism . I 'm sure Di Caprio et al had in depth briefings about the narrative and can explain it verbatim but us viewers are left to work it out for ourselves . And it 's so full of holes , so full of irrelevant tripe and so full of itself that it is n't easy . It 's incredible that its been voted the 3rd best film of all time by IMDb users . I mean seriously , that 's a joke . The fanboys all want to laud Nolan as the new Kubrick ( another joke ) but in doing so they have voted this tosh above ALL of Kubricks work . It 's such a smug self congratulatory film from the get go and it just gets smugger as time drags on . Now of course I appreciate that you can go too far in explaining every detail to the viewer with unnecessary script mechanics that insult the viewers intelligence . However , although you can go too far in explaining , you can also go too far in NOT explaining and expect the viewer to grasp in a single viewing what is a massively complex concept film - and one that 's so badly flawed in so many areas for it to undermine the whole 'intellectual ' nature of it . The idea of the film is OK and the film does have its moments but there are so many scenes that do n't make sense that it spoils it entirely . I appreciate that 'heist ' movies are usually procedural and that Nolan wanted to avoid that but in doing so he 's created the most self-indulgent picture ever . I could go on about the snow scene , the thoroughly implausible way these people not only do what they do but 'assemble ' as a team , the oh-I'm-Christoper-so-considerably-cleverer-than-you-are-Nolan backstory with Di Caprio 's wife but I 'm not going to pick apart the scenes because I 'd be here for hours and I have n't got the energy left after enduring this nonsense . Besides ; everything could be spun that he meant this or that ( he is n't as deep as he likes you to think ) . Inception is all fur coat and no knickers . It explains so little of what is going on that I left feeling angry . And I generally get these films so it 's not a case of me being some moronic fool who struggles to follow the weather .

It 's like having a beautiful building on the outside with no paint or decoration on the inside . It 's an empty shell of a film . There is no tension ; you could n't care less about any of the characters , why were they even motivated to do what they did . Helping a corporation get `` one over '' on another corporation is hardly saving the human race . When you operate in a dream environment , where you ca n't die or be injured really it means there is nothing to worry about , who cares what happens . All the explosions and actions sequences are just meaningless . By the way , why does Hollywood still keep filming action scene 's an inch away from every characters nose ? It 's impossible to see what 's going on , so many films are ruined by this . Watch and learn from the Matrix , take the camera backwards a couple of feet and we can actually work out what 's going on . So 2 and half hours of looking at my watch waiting for the very predictable ending , is a million miles from being a good film .

87,SHR_Doc8_Inception,"I had the misfortune of choosing to squander both time and money on seeing this turgid , overblown , and overrated mess at the cinemas upon its release . Now , I do n't mind some of Christopher Nolan 's movies . The first I ever saw was 'Memento ' shortly after its home release on DVD . I recalling really enjoying and liking that movie . I have n't seen it in a while , so it 's probably due another viewing . I think his oeuvre is pretty good , but nowhere near as good as his fan base would have you believe . He has some good films ( 'Memento ' , 'Insomnia ' , 'Batman/Dark Knight Trilogy ' - have n't seen 'Dunkirk ' so can not yet comment ) , some okay films ( 'The Prestige ' , 'Interstellar ' - sorry , I just ca n't get on board for that so called space 'epic ' - it has moments of greatness , but plenty of drek too ) , and then there 's 'Inception ' - which is in a league of its own ; one so far down , one has yet to be invented for it . Anyway , it really is just a total mess . Yeah , I know , it 's a movie about dreams . And some wise-guy will probably be thinking or saying , `` But , that 's exactly what dreams are like ; they 're messy ! '' . So yeah , maybe Nolan was clever enough to have the entire premise of the movie excuse how convoluted and nonsensical the entire plot is , because you know , that 's how dreams work , stupid ! Except , if wanted this sort of messy entertainment free of charge ( and with some actual mental benefits ) then I 'd have just taken a nap instead of going to watch 'Inception ' . Now , I wo n't spoil the movie here , because to be frank , Nolan did a pretty good job of that all on his own . Obviously he thought he could pass off a load of claptrap as genius ( lapped up without much resistance by his fan base and other easily satisfied punters ) because of aforementioned dream-state premise of the story . But there are other issues here as well . Like , a total absence of character development , decent script , or even passable action sequences , or pacing . There was one critic at the time of its cinematic release , whose name I do n't recall , but who perfectly encapsulated 'Inception ' in a nutshell , by penning something along the lines of , `` Inception may be directed by Christopher Nolan ; but it would appear that Nolan 's dreams are directed by Michael Bay '' .

88,SHR_Doc9_Inception,"Inception is certainly ambitious . And once again Nolan succeeds at doing exactly what you would expect him to do ; delivering sleek , thought provoking entertainment . At it 's core , however , this film is missing a few vital pieces that leave a certain something to be desired . The emotional crux of Inception is clear ; It 's about Leonardo DiCaprio 's character and his ultimate reconciliation with the regrets he has regarding his wife . That element of the film is spelled out crystal clear and is effective . The problem comes in that there 's a great deal of other subject matter that seems to exist only as thin props in Leo 's quest . After a relatively pointless setup in which the two main characters garner his wrath , Ken Watanabe 's character offers them an incredibly simplistic and convenient ultimatum , and from then on out the rest of Leo 's merry band seems to jump on board with the operation for no discernible reasons . Ellen Page ? Seeking college credit , apparently . Tom Hardy ? Well , his character has nothing better to do . JG Levitt ? He 's Leo 's buddy , you 'll have to take our word for it . Oh , and Michael Caine ... he 's about as useful as John Voight in National Treasure . The trouble with this , then , is that the action-based objective has no real power and urgency other than the promise of seeing Leo hug his kids ... and seeing the incredibly sketchy Cillian Murphy character hug his dying , old , tycoon father . Neither of which are sufficient emotional investments . A lot of this can be attributed to the simple fact that there is NO antagonist in the movie . None . No one is evil , not even Leo 's subconscious . Nothing is pushing back other than a vague threat of `` projections '' and the main character accidentally sabotaging the mission . In summary ... where 's Agent Smith ? It 's basic rules of drama and storytelling that have been around since Aristotle ; tension is created through opposition . Sure , there 's a time limit to the group 's escape from the various dream states , but no one is trying to stop them . Therefore , why should I really care what happens ? The supporting characters in this group live and die for a man they hardly know , for a goal that is n't even ( at the very least ) of monetary consequence . Yet , instead of defining these elements that matter more , the film instead spends a gratuitous amount time explaining arbitrary `` rules '' of the dreamworld , even though it simply glosses over the basics .

While the film Dark Knight will always be recognized to the new dimensions it added to the classic Batman series of movies and comics , Inception was nothing more than a dull and linear plot , surrounded by and an even duller and more linear plot . The centerpiece of this movie was supposed to be its convoluted storyline which was scattered across multiple levels , in essence puzzle that forces the viewer to think through the movie and decipher the ending . The concept of `` levels '' and or `` interconnected plots '' worked very well for such great films such as the Matrix , 2001 A Space Odyssey , Logan 's Run , or Total Recall . Inception not only miserably fails at this but it also lacks in other places as well . -Characters : Great actors , whom have all done great work in many movies spanning decades . However the characters in this movie came off as neutered eunuchs who lacked sense , emotion , and any sort of cohesiveness . ( Sir Michael Caine and Tom Berenger 's performances were appalling and the `` team '' of dreamers lacked screen dynamics and chemistry . ) -Action : For a dream world , the action in this movie is very unimaginative and is well within the typical Hollywood bounds . Car cash scenes where the heroes drive and shoot , building shootouts , and melodramatic bullet wounds ( as always one character is wounded critically , the team must save him ; however the character can still `` fight '' . ) -Plot : This movie could have easily been over within 1 hour of rolling . Not only was Inception 's `` puzzle ending '' blatantly obvious 40 mins into the film , but the storyline it self lacked any substance or draw . The overly complicated `` puzzle piece '' effect which Nolan was trying to achieve , was nothing more than the main story line being surrounded by excessive fluff and whimsical bullplop . * I will credit the movie with one notable mention . Nolan managed to work a Matrix style fight scene ( which have been overdone by Hollywood since the early 2000s ) into the small confines of an elevator . In the ending , Inception is not the great rave that many make it out to be . While the movie takes place in a `` dream world '' , where bounds are limitless , the movie itself is sterile , cliche , repetitive , and unimaginative . This is even further compounded by one dimensional characters , and a drawn out storyline that pretends to be an enigma .

But thanks to his skills , he 's perfectly capable of overcoming the incredible odds or at least that 's what the overwrought editing will have audiences assume . In this opening sequence alone , the camerawork is so shaky and hard to follow that it 's impossible to know exactly what is going on . Back in Washington D.C. , Banning awaits an offer to become the Director of the Secret Service for President Allan Trumbull ( Morgan Freeman ) . But despite his many years on the job , working to protect the President from all sorts of mayhem , Mike is n't certain he 's ready to sit behind a desk for the rest of his career . His abuse of pills for migraines , dizziness , and insomnia does n't help in making the decision , though his wife Leah ( Piper Perabo ) and their infant daughter Lynn would probably appreciate the less intensive promotion . Meanwhile , longtime friend Wade Jennings ( Danny Huston ) , who runs a private military contractor company called Salient Global , could use Banning 's assistance in securing training deals with the U.S. Department of Defense ( for which troops have been stretched thin due to so many ongoing international conflicts ) . `` You 're a disaster waiting to happen , '' a doctor cautions Mike , whose dizzy spells only seem to afflict him during the beginning of the film , and never in the midst of an action sequence . It 's fortunate that this condition does n't interfere with Mike 's ability to subdue much younger , better-equipped opposition , or even the equally matched Jennings , whose shadiness right from his introduction could n't be more obvious .

Basically , America is graphically imperiled for the sake of confirming a slogan coined by then-interim President Trumbull ( Morgan Freeman ) : `` As a nation , we are never stronger than when we are tested .

To defeat the North Koreans , Banning does what no officially sanctioned US agents can : he kills a bunch of bad guys without any remorse or reprisal , like the North Korean hostage that he shoots in the head , just to spook the other North Korean agent he has tied up ( `` Your friend seemed like a funny guy '' ) . `` Olympus Has Fallen '' is n't a good movie , but I could n't stop watching it .

92,LKP_Doc3_Angel_has_fallen,"`` Angel Has Fallen '' marks the third time that Gerard Butler , as the Secret Service agent and scowling samurai cowboy Mike Banning , has had to rescue the President of the United States from an international conspiracy so cuckoo bananas that the movie barely expects you to believe it . ( Actually , in the six years since this series launched , the bar for what people will believe has been lowered . For all I know , fans of the `` Fallen '' films think they 're based on true stories . ) In `` Olympus Has Fallen '' ( 2013 ) and `` London Has Fallen '' ( 2016 ) , the president was portrayed by Aaron Eckhart , who came off like a testy press secretary from the `` West Wing '' days . ( Eckhart is a good actor with a terse appealing manner , but he 's not exactly presidential . ) In `` Angel Has Fallen , '' the role of Leader of the Free World reverts back to Morgan Freeman , who has played it approximately 47 times or , at least , it feels that way . Seeing him back in the Oval Office is as comfy and reassuring as slipping into a daydream where Barack Obama is still president . Banning is now getting on a bit , suffering from chronic pain caused by a concussion and other woes he secretly medicates , lest anyone , from his wife ( Piper Perabo ) to the president , ask him to quit . He 's in line for the job of director of the Secret Service , but it 's a desk jockey gig . Butler 's squint tells you how he feels about that one . The plot which is to say , the plot against the president is , once again , a violently overwrought confection of `` topical '' comic-strip ludicrousness ; that 's the DNA of the `` Fallen '' series . Yet when you 're watching a big-budget B-movie , there 's good preposterous and there 's bad preposterous . Good preposterous is the setup of `` Angel Has Fallen '' : Banning , the most loyal and trusted agent of President Allan Trumball ( Freeman ) , is out guarding him on a winter afternoon fishing excursion when a vehicle pulls up in the woods and launches what looks like a flock of black birds . They are drones , equipped with smart bombs and computerized facial-recognition software , and as they fly low and target their prey , the explosions pile up with a satisfyingly surgical but relentless precision . In minutes , the 18 Secret Service agents hovering on the shore are all dead . And Mike ? He 's alive because the drones purposefully avoided him . He pulls Trumball under the water , and the result of this action is that the president is soon laying in a coma in",LKP_Doc3_Angel_has_fallen,LKP,Action,Negative,Angel_has_fallen

He is weighing the pros and cons of accepting a promotion , but he 's not going to have much time to think about that on the lam . When he gets framed for an assassination attempt on the president ( Morgan Freeman ) , he has no choice but to hit the road and try to prove his innocence . Now I do not consider myself to be a fan of this series . Olympus Has Fallen was okay , but it was n't nearly as fun as White House Down , which also happened to come out in the same year . There was definitely no reason to have a sequel made , and when we finally got London Has Fallen , we got a healthy dose of racism , xenophobia and downright incompetence when you break it down . So how does the third movie in this trilogy stack up ? I would call it worse than the original , but better than the second . I really do n't have a ton of strong feelings about this movie . It is exactly what it looks like , and if you have any experience with the action genre , you have absolutely seen this movie before . It 's the type of movie you 're destined to catch somebody 's dad watching on cable on a lazy afternoon and to further paint the picture , it will be one that he will change the channel on during a commercial and forget to come back to because he 's found something better . The story is simple , and yet they manage to give the villains a very elaborate plan that does n't make much sense when you break it down . And while I 'm on the subject of bad guys , I do have to say : if you have any experience with movies , you can already tell who is going to end up being the wolves in sheep 's clothing well before you get to the reveal . In fact , if you 're really good , you can probably make the deduction by simply giving the cast list a gander , and that 's really what this movie is in a nutshell : you know what you 're getting well before you even get there . The meat tastes like meat , and the potatoes taste like potatoes . I really just do n't feel any passion one way or the other about this movie . It 's rated R , but I think it could have just as easily been PG-13 if they cut out about 10 F-bombs . If I had something positive to say , I think Nick Nolte is decent , but he usually is whenever he shows up , especially now that he is in the twilight of his career .

Do n't you remember Antoine Fuqua 's Olympus Has Fallen ( Juice Rating 48/100 ) ? Or how about the sequel London Has Fallen ( 33/100 ) , does that jog your memory ? Well in case you forgot this is a Gerard Butler ( did you know his friends call him Jerry ) led franchise where he basically has to save the world from terrorist attacks . Semi wannabe Jack Bauer on some level , and has a lot of Bourne elements as well . This installment sees our hero Mike Banning be framed for an attempted assassination attempt on the new President Trumbull ( Morgan Freeman reprising his role ) . Quick aside , action sequels always do this where one of the story lines is framing the guy who has saved the world over and over again , its nonsense every time . Back to the movie though we see Mike go on the run and eventually run into his estranged father ( Nick Nolte ) and start to unravel a bigger plot . There is some of the best and most cohesive action of the series in this movie for sure . The first two all happen in dark hallways and it is hard to follow a lot . There are some fun explosions in `` Angel '' and the pace moves along pretty well . The humanization of Mike Banning though really brought a damper to this and kind of felt unnecessary . If I am going to a movie to basically see a super hero I do not want to hear about his concussions and broken ribs , just show me him kicking some ass . Stock Watch Stock Neutral Gerard Butler just did his thing in this and gave another solid action performance here . He has established himself as an upper tier action star and I think he still has a few years left of these type of movies . Stock Down Danny Huston has the bad guy look , but I just thought he was such a boring and predictable villain in this . Maybe it was the way his character was written , but it just did not resonate at all and felt like another faceless villain . Stock Down Nick Nolte has been on the decline for years and his over the top mumbling performance in this feels like the nail in the coffin to me . Believe me I love 48 Hrs . and Blue Chips but this was just weird to be honest . * A couple other tidbits - Piper Perabo replaced Radha Mitchell as Banning 's wife and she did not have much to do so it did not feel like it made a difference . - Morgan Freeman is just a great movie President .

95,LKP_Doc6_Angel_has_fallen,"As I left the theater the other night , I began to think about the connection between humanity and expectations . As a species , expectations are a massive part of our everyday lives . At every turn , we expect something . When reality fails to live up to our expectations , there are few feelings that replicate such disappointment . But when our expectations extend beyond our wildest dreams , it 's one of the best feelings in the world . Such is the case with `` Angel Has Fallen . '' After the dismal `` London Has Fallen , '' I was insanely skeptical about this sequel . After all , as a series continues , its quality decreases , most of the time anyway . But boy , was I wrong . Like `` Olympus Has Fallen , '' this film follows Mike Banning , a Secret Service agent . One day , while the President attempts to fish , a horde of drones attack Mike 's team . The crew gets wiped out , but Mike and the President survive the ordeal . Upon waking up , Mike realizes that he has been framed . The government places him under arrest , and in classic fashion , Mike attempts to uncover a corrupt plan . One of the reasons `` Olympus Has Fallen '' worked so well was because it employed emotional elements of human existence , like guilt and redemption . Of course , these elements are simple concepts that we have seen a million times in movies . However , I contend that in a world consisting of many complications and convolutions , these themes of simplicity are perfect for cinematic escapism . `` Angel Has Fallen '' takes the same route . In a wise turn of events , the film actually attempts to flesh out Mike as a human being . Before Mike becomes a fugitive , we are given a taste of his trials and tribulations . As the leader of the Secret Service enters retirement , Mike prepares himself for a potential promotion . Normally , this would be cause for celebration , but Mike , a man with an abundance of mileage , is falling apart . Insomnia and pills are his best friends . Migraines repeat themselves . His nerves are shot . Overall , he 's a shell of what he was in `` Olympus Has Fallen . '' And yet , he attempts to sustain a strong image . He hides his unhealthy lifestyle , and as a result , communication is minimized . As Mike Banning , Gerard Butler turns in an exceptional performance . With his tough persona and exhausted vibes , Butler creates a hero with a human complex , a far cry from the inferior cinematic figures that consist of superhuman components . Unfortunately , as Mike fights his opponents , the film conveniently throws his personal problems by the wayside",LKP_Doc6_Angel_has_fallen,LKP,Action,Positive,Angel_has_fallen
96,LKP_Doc7_Angel_has_fallen,"Angel Has Fallen may not be appreciably better than the first two installments of this lower-middle-range Mission : Impossible wannabe franchise , but it 's actually more fun first and foremost because of a vastly amusing turn by Nick Nolte as Gerard Butler 's eccentric Vietnam vet old coot father . Outfitted with a dizzying body count and robust R-rated mayhem , this late summer action entry brandishes a small war 's worth of bloody violence and heavy artillery to lure boys young and old to theaters , where the 2013 and 2016 entries both landed in the $ 200 million box office range worldwide . The first thing you ca n't help but notice is that Butler is getting a bit puffy around the gills as he pushes 50 ; not only that , but the president 's personal Secret Service macho man Mike Banning is experiencing disorienting dizzy spells that suggest that a move from the field to a desk job may be in order . Still , it does n't take long for Banning to once again prove that one of him , however diminished he may be , is worth a dozen of anyone else when it comes to protecting the President of the United States , who , in a bit of wish-fulfillment fantasizing , is played by Morgan Freeman and not , let 's say , by Alec Baldwin . In an elaborate set piece notable for its body count , President Allan Trumbull 's entire security staff is wiped out while protecting the chief executive during a fishing expedition not far from Washington ; only his personal bodyguard , Banning , manages to keep the president alive during this frightful onslaught by what look like brilliantly trained mercenaries . But what thanks does he get for his heroism ? Instant blame for the whole bloody fiasco from Vice President Kirby ( Tim Blake Nelson ) , who insists that Banning is in cahoots with the Russians , has him charged with the attempted murder of the president and is immediately sworn in as acting president . From here , screenwriters Robert Mark Kamen , Matt Cook and Ric Roman Waugh the latter of whom also directed , as he did on the previous series entry clearly spent most of their creative energy figuring out multiple ways in which Banning could wriggle out of seemingly inescapable predicaments , get caught or subdued again , then bust his way out to fight yet another day . Kirby 's first hours as president do n't go very well , as Banning slips through his fingers in short order . Waugh 's background is as a stuntman , and he no doubt put a lot of his old cohorts to work on this one ; bodies go flying every 20 minutes or so , as Banning at one point escapes in , of all things , a big rig , and you begin to think you 're",LKP_Doc7_Angel_has_fallen,LKP,Action,Positive,Angel_has_fallen
97,LKP_Doc8_Angel_has_fallen,"Gerard Butler continues to burnish his brand of square-jawed , derivative heroism in Angel Has Fallen , the third instalment in the pedestrian trilogy of actioners about a grizzled Secret Service agent who wo n't let anyone lay a hand on the American president . Noticeably livelier than Olympus Has Fallen and London Has Fallen , this sequel boasts some muscular sequences , nifty blockbuster-on-a-budget suspense and a moderately clever twist that finds Butler on the run after being accused of masterminding an assassination plot . But as usual with this series , the storytelling and character arcs tend toward the ludicrous , doling out cliches and macho posturing with an untroubled air . Set for release on August 21 in the UK and two days later in the US , Angel will hope to top the grosses of 2013 's Olympus ( $ 170 million worldwide ) and 2016 's London ( $ 206 million ) , both of which were released in March . There 's no direct action competition until mid-September 's Rambo : Last Blood , so expect solid grosses for this late-summer offering . Once again , Butler plays Mike Banning , assigned to protect President Trumbull ( Morgan Freeman ) . Because of the intense battles he survived in the previous two films , though , he is slowed down by concussions and migraines , which might make him receptive to accepting the president 's offer to become the director of the Secret Service , although Banning fears the monotony of a desk job . Those problems must quickly be set aside , however , once a coordinated attack wipes out more than a dozen Secret Service agents and leaves the President in a coma . Banning 's quick thinking saves Trumbull from death , but when he is framed for the assassination attempt , he has to evade capture while determining who orchestrated these killings . Butler , who also serves as producer , benefits greatly from the arrival of Snitch 's Ric Roman Waugh in the director 's chair : This former stuntman imbues Angel with a bare-knuckled urgency that complements the movie 's no-nonsense approach . There is far less widespread carnage in this film than in the earlier instalments , shifting gears to deliver a stripped-down , Fugitive-style picture which is more about the interpersonal character dynamics . Banning will reunite with an old military buddy , the aging Wade Jennings ( Danny Huston ) , and also seek out his estranged father , Clay ( Nick Nolte ) , who walked out on his family and now lives off the grid . But when Angel tries to say something weighty about the spiritual toll that combat takes on soldiers , these brief pauses for gravitas prove to be mostly ham-fisted . During the action set pieces , Waugh makes good use of silence in order to crank up the tension , focusing on relatively realistic sequences that rarely go",LKP_Doc8_Angel_has_fallen,LKP,Action,Positive,Angel_has_fallen

Yes there is a god , probably also played by Morgan Freeman . Trumbull has been promoted since London Has Fallen , Mike Banning 's last batshit outing , when taking on hundreds of terrorists across our capital 's tourist attractions led to our favourite Secret Service agent becoming incredibly thirsty . Banning too is up for promotion this time around , to Head of the Secret Service , now the current incumbent , David Gentry ( Lance Reddick ) is retiring . The plot for Angel Has Fallen is signalled a mile off . It 's so obvious who the bad guy is and who 's in league with him I started to think I was the one being played . There 's also some really useful exposition by telephone call , in case you still are n't sure , but it never detracted from my enjoyment . This is a terrific ride that careers through action movie tropes with little concern for the intricacies of a decent plot , but with a surprising sensitivity when it comes to father-son relationships . The third movie in an action franchise is the perfect point to bring on the introspection . We all know the main characters but you ca n't really go on blowing up huge numbers of people for the same old reasons . No , by number 3 you want to be blowing up huge numbers of people for slightly different reasons . For an anti-war film , a hell of a lot of people die : blown up , droned , blown up , burned to a crisp , stabbed , blown up , and shot . But at least this time we 've moved away from the evil Middle Eastern terrorists trope yes , to the delight of those like me who grew up during the Cold War , we 're back to evil Russians . Mike Banning ( Gerard Butler ) is tired and damaged , even at the start . He 's a wounded bear , self-medicating with painkillers , unable to sleep , concussion leaving him feeling like he 's underwater ( cue lots of lingering shots of him looking knackered ) .

His wife wants him home more , his baby daughter is growing up fast , but while waiting for news of his possible new job he still takes in a full-on combat training course at a facility owned by his old Forces buddy Wade Jennings ( Danny Huston ) .

99,LKP_Doc10_Angel_has_fallen,"The `` Has Fallen '' series , `` Olympus , '' `` London '' and now , `` Angel Has Fallen , '' is a curiously enduring franchise . It seems the character of Mike Banning , a foul-mouthed Secret Service agent played with a lumpy gruffness by Gerard Butler , has filled the void of the Everyman action hero , displaced by those with superpowers and elegant martial arts skills . Mike 's just a guy with a wife and kid who happens to be incredibly enthusiastic about stabbing people . And if there 's one thing we 've learned in this series , it 's always bring Mike to a knife fight . In the `` Has Fallen '' mythology , Mike has become a cipher , a character around whom a filmmaker can project the paranoid political fantasy of the week . In `` Olympus Has Fallen , '' Antoine Fuqua threw him into `` Die Hard in the White House '' against North Korea , while Babak Najafi plunked him into an international terrorist attack by a nefarious Middle Eastern group in `` London Has Fallen . '' So naturally , the only place to go now is home . `` Angel '' director and co-writer Ric Roman Waugh plops Mike into his own `` Three Days of the Condor , '' a conspiracy thriller in which the U.S. government has turned on him . This time , it 's our hero who has fallen , the `` guardian angel '' to President Trumbull ( Morgan Freeman , the only returning costar ) . After a drone attack on the president during a fishing trip , Banning wakes up cuffed to a hospital bed , framed to take the fall for the attempted hit . Indicted and imprisoned , then kidnapped by the very mercenaries who did try to kill the president , Banning has no choice but to go rogue ( as per usual ) . The tone of `` Angel '' is far more somber than the wisecracking `` Olympus '' or the frothing , jingoistic `` London . '' The weight makes the film strangely dull at times . ( How can a scene of Butler crashing a big rig into a tree be so flat ? ) But some moments in this outsize take on `` The Fugitive '' hit a real nerve , such as a shootout in an office building where young bearded white men in tactical gear pump thousands of rounds into drywall and office furniture . Banning is our fantasy for those very real scenarios : a strong , resourceful , yet exceedingly normal man of action . Waugh brings a chaotic , vertiginous style to `` Angel , '' potentially the best-looking of all the films , though it 's still riddled with unfortunately sketchy green screen . The director asserts Banning 's relatability and his vulnerability visually . He places the audience within Mike 's subjectivity",LKP_Doc10_Angel_has_fallen,LKP,Action,Positive,Angel_has_fallen

More epic in both scope and length than its predecessor ( the running time outstrips even Tarantino 's ultra-indulgent Once Upon a Time in Hollywood ) , Andy Muschietti 's good-looking sequel has visual style to spare as it pits its now-adult antiheroes against an ever-expanding creepshow of shrieking scary monsters and crawly super creeps . From giant , drooling clowns to grotesque insect apparitions and spiderlike shape-shifters , It Chapter Two does n't skimp on the funhouse theatrics , even riffing on a quotable moment from John Carpenter 's The Thing , which remains a monstrous benchmark for mind-bending 80s horror . Yet in stretching its canvas so far , the film also bursts the balloon-like charm of its predecessor , throwing more at the audience while ultimately landing less of an engaging emotional punch . Twenty-seven years after the Goonies-inflected adventures of the first film , the former members of the Losers ' Club from Derry , Maine ( now played by a new , grownup cast ) , have gone their separate ways , all but forgetting the oath they swore about their ghoulish childhood nemesis : `` If it ever comes back , we 'll come back too . '' Each has their own life , although the past still haunts them . Bill ( James McAvoy ) is a popular writer who has a problem with endings ; Beverly ( Jessica Chastain ) has swapped an abusive father for an equally toxic husband ; Ben ( Jay Ryan ) is still lovelorn despite remodelling himself as a ripped success story ; Eddie ( James Ransone ) has retreated into risk assessment ; Richie ( Bill Hader ) has funnelled his insecurities into standup comedy ; and Stanley ( Andy Bean ) lives in terror of his childhood nightmare returning . Only Mike ( Isaiah Mustafa ) has stayed in Derry , awaiting an echo of former horrors that will call his comrades to `` come home , come home '' . Things start promisingly with a nostalgic roundup that reunites the old gang in a Chinese restaurant , laying the table for what is to come . An encounter with devilish fortune cookies soon mutates into a shiversome set piece , the palpable chills of which are promptly undercut by a reassuring pay-off gag ( `` Can we get the check ? '' ) . This is a recurrent trope : whenever fear rears its ugly head , humour is swiftly deployed to rebalance the upbeat atmosphere , undercutting any genuine sense of dread .

Adapting any Stephen King novel or , for that matter , shorter material is always a hit-or-miss gig , but It Chapter Two manages to pull out all the stops and in several areas actually tops the first film . No mean feat , that , as It was absolutely the creepshow that King fans have been slavering for for decades , chock-full of genuinely dream-snatching horror imagery bound together within a latticework of unrelenting dread and the everlasting kidhood bond of its young protagonists . And then there was Pennywise ( played again here by Skarsgard ) , Barnum & Bailey 's worst nightmare and then some . An apropos analogy : If It was The Evil Dead of soul-and-psyche-raping harlequin horror shows , then It Chapter Two is comparable to Raimi 's Evil Dead 2 in terms of sheer lunatic inventiveness and stupefying scenes of hallucinatory , visceral viciousness . As one of the now grownup Losers Club puts it ( in a droll homage to John Carpenter 's The Thing ) , `` You got ta be fucking kidding me . '' Set 27 years after the events of the first film , Chapter Two reunites ( mostly ) the no-longer-Losers Club characters as they make good on their childhood promise to return to the well and truly cursed Maine hamlet of Derry . With the lone exception of Mike Hanlon ( Mustafa ) , who has stuck around as the town librarian for the intervening two-decades-plus in order to keep an eye out for the potential return of the soul-sucking , child-gnawing Bozo from beyond , the gang has scattered into their adult lives , their memories of that long-ago nightmare summer oddly forgotten . Smartass Richie ( Hader ) is now a stand-up comic , `` Stuttering '' Bill ( McAvoy ) has turned out to be a successful novelist , Bev ( Chastain ) is a Chicago fashion designer , the once-overweight Ben ( Ryan ) is now a buff architect , and asthmatic Eddie ( Ransone ) pilots a limo . Only Stanley ( Bean ) seems to still be haunted by the ghosts of Derry past . It 's no spoiler to say that the Losers are quickly reunited in that strange little town , called from afar by Mike , who reminds them of the oath they took after vanquishing ( heh , heh , hur ) Pennywise back in 1989 . Apart from that , I 'll say little about Chapter Two 's serpentine plotting , except to note that returning screenwriter Gary Dauberman ( working without It co-scribes Cary Fukunaga and Chase Palmer this time out ) infuses the proceedings with somewhat more adult terrors , as befits the storyline .

On the plus side , each movie completes multiple character arcs in more or less satisfying ways , understanding that for all of the expensive special effects being displayed on screen , the main quality that makes or breaks a film is whether or not we care about the protagonists . Each one also has an iconic villain at the center of its story , although the baddie in `` It Chapter Two '' is horrifying , while Thanos of the MCU is intended to be more of an intimidating `` final boss '' archetype . Finally each movie , despite the roughly three-hour running time , feels lean ; neither drags or feels padded out , but keeps moving along at a brisk clip . On the less flattering side : Each movie works better on an emotional level than a logical one . Picking up where 2017 's `` It '' left off , `` Chapter Two '' again directed by Andy Muschietti tells the story of seven adults who have suppressed traumatic memories from their childhoods in the fictional town of Derry , Maine . They are of course forced to confront them when an evil supernatural clown threatens to murder innocent people . As readers of King 's novel will know , the cast of characters is extensive . It includes Bill ( James McAvoy ) , a successful writer who had to overcome a debilitating stutter as a child ; Richie ( Bill Hader ) , a stand-up comedian whose vulgarity is revealed to be motivated by a secret character trait that serves as one of the film 's plot twists ( and one of the most notable deviations from previous tellings ) ; Beverly ( Jessica Chastain ) , a fashion designer who was physically and sexually abused by her father ; Eddie ( James Ransone ) , a risk assessor who suffers from hypochondria and had an overbearing mother ; Ben ( Jay Ryan ) , a wealthy architect who used to be obese ; Mike ( Isaiah Mustafa ) , the town librarian whose family suffered from drug abuse and still struggles with it himself ; and Stanley ( Andy Bean ) , who was frightened and weak as a child and is much the same as an adult . Not surprisingly , a movie that has to juggle so many plot threads at once and that 's not including the violent bully Henry ( Teach Grant ) , who went to prison after murdering his father in the first movie will wind up shortchanging a few of them . The big twist about Richie feels underdeveloped , which is a shame given Hader 's strong dramatic performance , and the movie 's attempts to tie into larger social issues comes across as forced , if well-intentioned",UAJ_Doc3_It_Chapter_Two,UAJ,Horror,Positive,It_Chapter_Two

The sequel to the 2017 horror smash faithfully follows Stephen King 's epic , 1,100-page , 1986 bestseller by skipping ahead 27 years and tracking its protagonist kids into their messy , angst-ridden adulthood . Once called the Losers Club , these children of Derry , Maine , are having a reunion . Not by choice by force . As young'uns , they vowed only to come home if Pennywise , the twisted and murderous clown who wreaked havoc in Derry back in the day , returned for another killing spree . Well , he 's back . And so is Bill Skarsgard , irreplaceable as the clown prince of infamy . Just the sight of him freezes the blood , flashing those yellow teeth and beckoning prey with that squeaky voice , making false promises that 'll end with him biting their arm off , or worse . Pennywise is only one manifestation of the shape-shifting It , but he 's surely the most horrifying , able to plant seeds of unrest in the subconscious for many sleepless nights to come . You 're hooked , right ? And you 'll be pleased to know that the whole cast come up aces . Bill Hader takes Best in Show as Richie `` Trashmouth '' Tozier , the kid with glasses who is now an acid-tongued L.A. comic . Hader nails the laughs , of course , but his triumph comes in finding the well of loneliness that fuels Richie 's fear , not just of It but of the secret he keeps buried . James McAvoy also scores as Bill Denbrough , Richie 's childhood bestie who married a movie star ( Jess Weixler ) and is famous for writing books and screenplays with endings everyone hates ( hold that thought ; it might apply to this movie ) . Jay Ryan excels as Ben Hanscom , once bullied for being overweight but currently an architect who looks hotter than `` a team of Brazilian soccer players , '' a fact that does not go unnoticed by Beverly Marsh ( Jessica Chastain ) , the only female in the Losers Club and once a source of romantic rivalry between Ben and Bill . Chastain brings genuine grit and grace to the role of a fashion designer once abused by her father and currently by her husband . Maybe facing It will enable her to make some essential life changes . It 's Mike Hanlon ( Isaiah Mustafa ) , the only African American in the gang and the only one of the Losers still living in Derry , who issues the distress call that brings home the old team , including Stanley Uris ( Andy Bean ) , an accountant who 's not as nerdy as he looks , and",UAJ_Doc4_It_Chapter_Two,UAJ,Horror,Positive,It_Chapter_Two

For fans of Stephen King , the answer always seems to be `` never enough . '' The pop pulp shiver-giver inspires in readers a kind of ravenous insatiability that has thwarted his false-alarm retirement and felled more trees than the fires blazing in the Amazon rainforest . That same appetite helped feed the excitement for director Andy Muschietti 's `` It '' a monster hit two years ago , earning more than $ 700 million and ought to bring audiences back in even greater numbers for `` It : Chapter Two , '' an elaborate fun-house horror movie that springs pop-up gimmicks and boogie-boogie scares steadily enough to excuse its been-there story and self-important 169-minute running time . From the `` Lord of the Rings '' saga to the `` Avengers '' sequels , length confers a kind of false legitimacy on middlebrow entertainment , no matter the medium . When first published in 1986 , `` It '' was by far the longest-winded of King 's prolix books ( outgassing `` The Stand '' by more than 200 pages ) , and its sheer heft gave the semblance of significance among the prolific author 's oeuvre , despite the doorstop 's relatively silly plot . Quality was almost irrelevant to the discussion . Teenagers who could n't be bothered to read Joseph Conrad 's slender `` Heart of Darkness '' in English class boasted about having conquered `` It '' on their own , inevitably touting it as King 's freakiest novel . And then they moved on . The fear faded . They forgot . Now , dear reader , it 's time to reunite and confront the specter of those things that frightened us most . At least , that 's the added-value appeal for King devotees , whose experience conceivably mirrors that of his characters : seven adolescent outcasts who dubbed themselves the Losers Club and thought they had vanquished Pennywise ( Bill Skarsgard ) , the supernatural child-killer with the oblong skull , splayed eyes and shark-like grin . Twenty-seven years after they sent Pennywise back to whatever parallel dimension `` It '' came from , these unlikely heroes are called upon to make good on the blood oath they took as teens a device that allows the movie to re-cast its adolescent ensemble as better-known movie stars . Of the group , only Mike ( Chosen Jacobs before , now played by Isaiah Mustafa as an adult ) has stuck around in Derry , Maine , working at the library , where he can freely obsess about the monster 's origins and how to defeat the creature should It ever return .

As I explained in Slate back in 2017 on the occasion of the release of It : Chapter One , It holds a particularly cherished position in my heartI 've reread Stephen King 's magnum opus so many times since I first read it in middle school that I 've literally lost countso there was never any question that such absences were going to stand out to me . But watching It : Chapter Two , a visually inventive and at times extremely scary film that , at nearly three hours long , could have stood to omit considerably more , I could n't help but feel like many of director Andy Muschietti and screenwriter Gary Dauberman 's choices in adaptation were much worse than necessary sacrifices . They felt like grave misunderstandings , if not willful betrayals , of some of the richest parts of their source material . Like most 1,000-page , decades-spanning novels about clowns who kill children , It has long been thought to be an unfilmable work . It : Chapter One acquitted itself surprisingly well in this regard , although it did so by sailing the ol ' paper boat down the road , so to speak . In adapting King 's novel to the screen , Muschietti and Dauberman made two major changes to the original material . The first was disentangling the novel 's two parallel timelinesone about the protagonists ' childhood and the other about their adulthoodto make them two discrete entities presented in chronological order . ( In King 's novel these two sections are interwoven with one another . ) The second was changing the eras in which these two sections are set . In the novel , the childhood sections take place in 1957 and '58 , and the adulthood sections in 1984 and '85 ; in the movie , the childhood section takes place in 1988 and '89 , and the adulthood section in 2016 . It : Chapter One thus offered audiences the surprisingly enjoyable experience of watching an R-rated horror film starring a remarkably charismatic cast of foulmouthed adolescents , while collaterally benefiting from the rush on 1980s nostalgia prompted by the runaway success of Netflix 's Stranger Things , a show that owed no small debt to King 's body of work . In choosing this more linear structure , though , the filmmakers also opted to backload many of the novel 's most complex and compelling aspects onto the second movie , setting themselves up for a landing more difficult to execute than the Ritual of Chud . That It : Chapter Two struggles to completely stick that landing is no fatal failure , and in many ways confirms what",UAJ_Doc6_It_Chapter_Two,UAJ,Horror,Negative,It_Chapter_Two

Incidentally , 27 years is also roughly the running time of this movie . Complete with childhood wonder and psychological depth , 2017 's It , which , like this film , was directed by Andy Muschietti , felt like the rare balanced meal of a horror film . The obscenely bloated length of its sequel ( OK , it 's just a shade under three hours , but still ) makes the follow-up film seem comparatively like an all-you-can-eat buffet where one overindulges to the point that even the prime rib starts to taste like mystery meat . The good stuff includes the manner in which the adult actors ' performances are informed by their childhood counterparts , especially Bill Hader ; the way the relationships evolve and recalibrate over the course of the story ; and the sing-songy psychopathic joy with which actor Bill Skarsgard revives Pennywise , the many-toothed dancing clown who continues to chomp down on the town of Derry 's children and downtrodden . But as singular as Pennywise may be and let 's face it , in the year of Joaquin Phoenix 's Joker , he is pretty much just another murderous freak in greasepaint paying homage to Heath Ledger the blood-mad Bozo tends to get lost in the baker 's dozen of monsters that It Chapter Two unleashes on us as if it 's having a going-out-of-business sale . There are embryonic winged things that pop out of fortune cookies , an oversized witch , a homicidal statue , a zombie hobo and even a Pomeranian with evil intent . It 's a zero-sum game , with each subsequent supposed terror having the net effect of blunting the impact of what came before . Part of the issue is the plotting , which borrows faithfully from Stephen King 's source material but feels structured more like a multiplayer video game . Once the far-flung and no longer close former members of the Losers ' Club are reunited by Mike ( one-time Old Spice guy Isaiah Mustafa ) , the only member of the group who remained in Derry and lead a less than successful life , each of them must face down the literal demons of their shared summer in order to snag an artifact that represents their pain . They then must sacrifice the items in a Native American ritual that may once and for all destroy Pennywise and the evil forces he embodies .

That 's a question It Chapter Two asks on a thematic level as it finishes up Stephen King 's saga about a mythical beast that takes the form of a freaky clown to feed on fear . It 's also a query that can be posed to the film itself , which , at nearly three hours , neuters Pennywise 's terror , slogging along to a conclusion that starts to feel both inevitable and like it will never actually arrive . Once again helmed by Andy Muschietti , the second It picks up on the now forty-something members of the Losers Club 27 years after the events of the first film . When Pennywise returns to their hometown of Derry , aiding and abetting in a grisly hate crime , Mike ( Isaiah Mustafa ) , the one Loser left in small-town Maine , calls up his erstwhile pals to come and fight . The trouble is , no one other than Mike remembers what befell them when they were tweens , a side effect of wrestling with It , thus forcing them all to reckon with their childhood traumas while battling the shapeshifting `` It . '' It 's not exactly a waltz down memory lane . Despite covering only one bit of an extremely lengthy book , the 2017 initial installment in Muschietti 's saga felt strangely complete , updating the action from the 1950s to the 1980s and focusing solely on the Losers as kids , portrayed by the likes of Finn Wolfhard , Sophia Lillis , and Jaeden Martell . Chapter Two casts grown-up versions of Richie , Bev , and Bill -- played by Bill Hader , Jessica Chastain , and James McAvoy , respectively -- but refuses to let childhood go completely , interspersing numerous flashbacks that seems to reiterate what was previously covered in just a slightly different manner . The caliber of the new cast is invariably the draw of the sequel . Chastain is an Oscar nominee who had demonstrable chemistry with McAvoy in the 2014 indie The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby ; meanwhile , Hader 's Emmy-winning work on Barry has made him one of the most exciting actors on any screen . Still , by virtue of the storytelling , the adult actors are n't really allowed the chance to gel in the way their younger counterparts are , and thus the fun of watching them all together is dulled . Among the cast additions -- which also include Jay Ryan as Ben and James Ransone as Eddie -- Hader is the standout , bringing a twitchy energy to jokester Richie , who has grown up to be a hacky stand-up , peddling other people 's jokes .

At issue is the ending . Nobody likes his endings not the studio , not the director who lied to him about liking it , not even his wife . It 's a welcome bit of author-approved self-deprecation from King , whose endings have often been chaotic , and a little comic insulation for the film itself , which proceeds to wrap up the story in a tidy 169 minutes . That 's enough time to space out multiple callbacks to the joke and make it seem fresh every time . Yet It Chapter Two does still botch the ending , mostly by repeating the mistakes of the first chapter and taking too long to do it . Cleaving King 's novel neatly in half , director Andy Muschietti has followed the same group of friends as 'tweens , when they were tormented by the evil Pennywise the clown in Derry , Maine , and now 27 years later as middle-aged adults , when they 're summoned back for a final showdown . Though Muschietti 's 2017 Ithad the virtues of a rich working-class setting and an ensemble that recalled the profane misfits of Stand By Me , Pennywise 's M.O . is to confront all seven of them with a realization of their worst nightmare . This became a grind . Though the ranks have thinned somewhat for the sequel , the formula more or less repeats itself : All the surviving members of the Losers Club are once again confronted by a revived and emboldened Pennywise , who turns the horrors of past and present into hellish echo chamber that only they can quiet . But this time , their experiences have morphed into a needlessly complicated mythology that slows the film 's wind-up considerably , even after it goes through the hard labor of bringing so many characters back together . The first It brought a robust blockbuster maximalism to the horror genre , and the sequel , like many blockbuster franchises , starts to list from all the baggage . With Pennywise terrorizing Derry once more 27 years after they vanquished him , the Losers Club follows through on a pact to reunite should the clown ever come back , though most of them have pushed their childhoods ( and friendships ) to the deepest recesses of their memories .

You should be running instead of : dropping in on a spooky , abandoned theater . Sticking a hand down the sewer drain where your baby brother was snatched by a monster . Or paying a visit to the decrepit childhood home where you were repeatedly assaulted . And , yet , the characters in `` It Chapter Two '' who are supposed to be veterans of Stephen King-style childhood horrors do those dumb things and more . `` Chapter Two '' picks up 27 years after the events of `` It , '' in which seven adolescent friends were terrorized by the evil clown Pennywise , who fed on their secret fears . Ultimately , they vanquished him , but they 've gone their separate ways , blanking out their memories of each other , until a friend summons them home to take on Pennywise again . The setup is potent because King is so good at exploiting primal emotions . Much more than a horror movie , `` Chapter Two '' is an unsettling stew of grief , insecurity and guilt not exactly the tastiest of stews , but one we can all relate to . Some of the new encounters with Pennywise are well executed by director Andy Muschietti , who also made the first `` It . '' That one relied too much on shocks , rather than scares , but `` Chapter Two '' creates real suspense in , for instance , a claustrophobic encounter in a mirrored funhouse . Essentially , the new movie covers the second half of King 's 1,138-page doorstop , but even in biting off only half of the book , there 's too much material . `` Chapter Two '' languishes over two hours and 49 minutes and it feels even longer because of its structure . `` Chapter Two '' often has the friends played as adults by Chastain , Bill Hader and , disconcertingly , Old Spice pitchman Isaiah Mustafa split up to pursue individual nightmares , before reuniting to battle Pennywise together . That feels very like an old-style video game , rather than a narrative . Instead of building and building , the movie keeps resetting at zero as a new character takes on a new `` level .

By taking healthy doses of `` The Shining '' , `` The Sixth Sense '' and Alfred Hitchcock and mixing thoroughly , Mr. Amenabar creates a haunted house that is at once familiar and unique . The film takes place entirely in a mansion on the Channel Islands in 1945 where Grace ( Nicole Kidman ) and her two children Anne and Nicholas ( the precocious Akakina Mann and the believably naive James Bentley ) live in complete darkness . In an inventive conceit , the film asserts that Anne and Nicholas are photo-sensitive and exposure to bright light could be fatal . This forces Grace to train her new nanny Mrs. Mills ( the disconcertingly mild-mannered Fionnula Flanagan ) that `` no door must be opened until the previous one is closed '' . From this setup , which does n't feel forced or convoluted in the film , the film begins its slow , stifling build during which more questions than doors are left open . At the center of the film is a performance of unexpected complexity by Nicole Kidman . Ms. Kidman has always been a fine actress , but in `` The Others '' she takes everything you know about her and represses it . Only her flowing hair betrays the buttoned-down persona she so completely inhabits throughout the film . Fervently religious and violently obsessed with protecting her children , Mr. Kidman 's performance is a study in nuanced unraveling .

The scares in the film are the old fashioned kind , which are implied rather than shown . Thanks to his sparse music , sharp cast and writing which doles out information like a mathematical puzzle , Mr. Amenabar is able to keep the audience in suspense for much of the film .

Set in 1945 on Jersey , one of the Channel Islands situated between Britain and France , World War II is over . A pasty , clammy-looking young woman named Grace lives with her two small children on a large estate in a manor house shrouded in darkness and fog . Her husband , who had gone off `` to fight the baddies '' in the war , has not yet returned home and Grace anxiously awaits his return despite his being presumed dead for the past 1 12 years . Her children , young Nicholas who is scared of his own shadow , and his sister , the precocious , inquisitive Anne , suffer from such a sensitivity to light that should they be exposed to anything above a dim oil lamp or candle flicker , they will die . Over-the-top , Bible-obsessed Christian that she is , Grace home schools the children in what appears to be their only subject religion in anticipation of Anne 's First Communion and the life hereafter with all of its various hells .

Curtains must always be drawn not due just to the children 's light sensitivity , but as a measure to ease Grace 's migraines . There is to be no noise . And above all , one must not believe any `` stories '' told by the children .

Unfortunately , this the most interesting thing that happens for the next 45 minutes . Spanish writer/director Alejandro Amenabar , who helmed the film , definitely does not fall into the trap of overstating the horror in his horror film ( I have often complained that scary movies undermine their own effectiveness by overdoing their effects ) , but he almost goes too far in the opposite direction , keeping the action at a slow , plodding pace that provokes more yawns than gasps from his audience . Kidman , who is onscreen during practically every scene , is suitably affected , but one can only witness so many minutes of wandering tensely around a darkened mansion looking for ghosts before one thinks , `` Okay , show me something scary , or I 'm going to go watch Rush Hour 2 again . '' The final reel of The Others is reasonably captivating , but the 85 minutes that come before it are mostly just dull and atmospheric . Kidman 's character , Grace , is a mother of two who is still waiting in her huge and unneccessarily scary house in the Channel Islands for the return of her husband from World War II . The trouble is , it 's fall 1945 , the war ended several months ago , and she still has n't heard a word .

While Grace alternates between catching up on her embroidery and psychologically torturing her kids with scary Bible lessons , her new staff of three begins to learn the rules of the house .

It most closely resembles the Henry James story `` Turn of the Screw , '' as that one was filmed by Jack Clayton and was called `` The Innocents . '' That film 's premise is also of a woman desperately trying to save the two children in her care from invisible invaders in their house . The 29-year-old acclaimed Chilean-born , Spain-based director , Alejandro Amenabar ( Open Your Eyes/Thesis ) , provides a surprise ending to this chiller , which the clever viewer might guess since there are enough clues laid down . That 's something `` The Sixth Sense '' did , but there it worked better because the story was more plausible and less artsy , so when the surprise ending resulted it seemed more satisfactory than in Amenabar 's film . The dark and somber tone of Amenabar 's film lingers for too long to make it seem anything more than an atmospheric and stylish mumbo-jumbo scare film . It creeps along at a gruelingly slow pace , belaboring its point that ghosts can live among the living . The film is set in 1945 , just as WW11 ended , in a remote house on the isle of Jersey , in the English Channel . But time seems irrelevant , as it could be set at any time , though the story fits most readily into the Victorian period . The mansion is inhabited by a stern , bossy , high-strung , Bible fundamentalist Catholic mother , Grace ( Nicole Kidman-looking like Grace Kelly in the 1940s ) , her two vulnerable children , Ann ( Alakina ) and Nicholas ( Bentley ) , and three odd servants who mysteriously show up and offer their services when the other servants fled for no apparent reason not even bothering to collect their wages . The servants include : the head housekeeper , Bertha Mills ( Fionnula Flanagan- a noted Irish actress ) , the gardener , Mr. Tuttle ( Sykes ) , and a young cleaning lady who is mute , Lydia ( Cassidy ) . The house is not only creepy and filled with ghost sounds , but is enveloped in darkness because all the windows must be covered with thick curtains as the children are mysteriously allergic to the light and if exposed it could be fatal to them . Grace is the household head because her husband Charles ( Eccleston ) has not returned from the war and has been reported as a MIA , though she still has some hope that he will return . In the house there is no telephone , no radio and no electricity . Also",HAK_Doc8_The_Others,HAK,Horror,Negative,The_Others
118,HAK_Doc9_The_Others,"`` The Others '' is a haunted house mystery -- from which you assume , trained by recent movies , that it is filled with flashy special effects , violent shocks , blood-curdling apparitions , undulating staircases , telescoping corridors , graves opening in the basement , doors that will not lock or will not open , and dialogue like `` There 's something in this house ! Something . . . diabolic ! '' You would be right about the dialogue . This is a haunted house movie , dark and atmospheric , but it 's quiet and brooding . It has less in common with , say , `` The House on Haunted Hill '' than with `` The Sixth Sense '' or a story by Oliver Onions . It 's not a freak show but a waiting game , in which an atmosphere of dread slowly envelops the characters -- too slowly . Comparing this movie with `` The Sixth Sense , '' we feel a renewed admiration for the way M. Night Shyamalan was able to maintain tension through little things that were happening , instead of ( this film 's strategy ) big things that seem about to happen . The film takes place in an isolated manor on the island of Jersey , off the British coast . In this house lives Grace ( Nicole Kidman ) and her two children , the tremulous Nicholas ( James Bentley ) and the cheeky Anne ( Alakina Mann ) . To the house one day come three servants , who are responding , or say they are responding , to Grace 's advertisement for domestic help . There are vacancies because the previous servants decamped in the middle of the night without a word of notice . The three new applicants have the advantage of being familiar with the house . It is a sound tradition of British fiction that servants do not leave a house only to later return and be rehired ( the sole exception is George Wellbeloved , Lord Emsworth 's pig-keeper at Blandings Castle ) . But these are the days immediately after World War II , which claimed , or seems to have claimed , Grace 's husband in battle , and so perhaps help is hard to find . She hires them : Mrs. Mills ( Fionnula Flanagan ) , the middle-aged Irish woman with the know-it-all nods , the young mute girl Lydia ( Elaine Cassidy ) , and the gardener Mr. Tuttle ( Eric Sykes ) , who is so ancient that for him planting a seed is an act of wild optimism . There are odd rules in the house . Each of the 50 doors must be locked before another can be opened . The curtains must always be drawn . These measures are necessary , Grace explains , because Anne and Nicholas are so allergic to the sunlight that they might die if exposed to",HAK_Doc9_The_Others,HAK,Horror,Negative,The_Others
119,HAK_Doc10_The_Others,"An ambitious disappointment , `` The Others '' is one reason why I hardly take word-of-mouth from critics and viewers , positive and negative alike , into account when I go to the movies . Directed by Alejandro Amenabar ( and featuring an executive producer credit for Tom Cruise ) , this film 's strong points include solid but unspectacular acting that is enhanced by the cinematography and production design that nicely enhance a foreboding , isolated English mansion and spacious surrounding grounds ( which were all filmed on location in Spain ) , but it is overshadowed by its incredibly slow pace and thin , recycled plot ( which unfortunately has led to inevitable conclusions to `` The Sixth Sense '' ) . It is backed up by a flimsy score that descends into silliness during tense moments , thus killing their effectiveness . As she should , Nicole Kidman provides the film 's best performance as Grace , who , despite the insistence of her young daughter ( Alakina Mann ) , refuses to believe that there may be ghosts inhabiting her house , where she pines away every day while waiting for her husband Charles ( Christopher Eccleston ) to return home from the war . She takes in three new servants - a codger ( Eric Sykes ) , a mute ( Elaine Cassidy ) , and a crone ( Fionnula Flanagan , who , for some reason , reminded me of the maid portrayed by Hermione Baddeley in `` Mary Poppins '' ) , after her previous help mysteriously disappears , but there is a lot more to this strange trio than she could possibly imagine . Mann and James Bentley , respectively , make their first big screen appearances as Anne and Nicholas , two youngsters who have a potentially fatal allergy to light - or who are `` photosensitive , '' as Grace verbalizes it - which results in an exhausting routine to make sure every door and shutter in the house is always shut and every curtain always drawn . It 's a subplot that does n't have much of an impact on the film as a whole . Despite `` The Others '' being hailed for its suspense factor , all the suspense is couched into the last thirty minutes . The early scenes in which Anne insists that there are indeed supernatural visitors lurking about ( in particular a little boy named Victor ) , which lead to Grace 's eventual inspection of her surroundings , have no punch at all - save for one sequence in which Grace discovers an old photo album - because it 's too predictable and ... well , boring . It 's something we 've all seen a million times before . The music repeatedly hams up the `` scare that 's not really there '' schtick , which quickly became tiresome .

120,OZP_Doc1_TheConjuring2,"In a haunted-house thriller , inanimate objects frequently poses a threat , and one of the modest charms of director James Wans The Conjuring lied in how it mined chills from spare furnishings . With the exception of its arsenal of analog ghost-hunting equipment , the 2013 film largely ignored the pop-cultural bric-a-brac of its early-1970s setting , instead lingering on the eras clothing and interior design : floral wallpapers , fabric ties , massive armoires , and the shared bedrooms of indistinguishable siblings . The film was a well-executed fount of maximalist chills , but its modest trappings lent The Conjuring a patina of classical elegance.The Conjuring 2 finds the evangelical paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren ( Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga ) housebound , reduced to a voluntary retirement after their work combating the 1976 Amityville horrors , which are recreated in a flashy prologue . For the next hour , the film follows a formula more like Wans Furious 7 than any of his previous horror efforts . Its a series of undifferentiated , if often extremely entertaining , genre scares , distinguished by judicious shock cuts and roving tracking shots . Before finally sending the Warrens back to work , the film alternates listlessly between PTSD-enhanced terrors experienced by the clairvoyant Lorraine and those wrought upon a new beleaguered family : the Hodgsons of Londons Enfield borough , purported victims of a poltergeist haunting from 1977 until 1979 . This wildly undisciplined sequel is the inverse of its predecessor : The Enfield house is small , but its as full of traps as it is winking jokes . In the living room , the walls are rotting with moisture as a worn leather chair creaks unbidden and the family telly cycles through images of a young Margaret Thatcher . An eerie , vaginal-looking childrens play tent lies at one end of a narrow second floor hallway ; at the other , young Janet Hodgson ( Madison Wolfe ) shares a bedroom with her sister , Margaret ( Lauren Esposito ) . Humpty Dumpty sits on a dresser , waiting to fall , surrounded by posters of aging teen idol David Soul.Such a clutter of empty signifiers is emblematic of the film as a whole , which only bothers to develop its characters in the immediate run-up to its extended finale . Wolfe makes a solid impression as the Hodgsons beleaguered satanic medium , but Frances OConnors harried mother is given far less attention than Lili Taylors equivalent character in the original . On a scene by scene basis , The Conjuring 2 is a model of heightened tension and uneasy release ( Don Burgesss camera always feels like its ready to be jostled ) , but the tropes propelling these night terrors , particularly the CGI-addled teleportation and Wans increasingly tired sonic melanges of ghostly moans and clanking pipes , grow stale pretty quickly .

121,OZP_Doc2_TheConjuring2,"Back in 2013 , James Wans The Conjuring represented the high point of a wave of mainstream horror that showed there was still value in old-school scares that there was life beyond torture porn and slick slasher reboots . It was a ghost storyturnedpossession thriller that mined terror out of the most basic of elements : a young girl staring in fear at a dark corner of her room , or a childrens hide-and-seek-type game gone horribly wrong . In other hands , those scenarios might have remained cliches : How many times have we vowed never to look into that closet again , or not to go down those basement stairs , or to toss out that creepy doll ? But Wan found horror in simplicity . And for him , style , atmosphere , and emotion werent exploitative devices ; he invested them with meaning . His camera stalked his characters like an obsessed presence , and he found pathos in the spectacle of a loving mothers transformation into a murderous demon . It is hard to believe that The Conjuring 2 was made by the same man . The streamlined elements of the first have now given way to mind-numbing clutter . If before Wan stripped down each set piece to its essentials a roving camera , a patch of darkness , a fearful face , paralyzing silence now he has thuds and booms and shadows and shaking furniture and screaming characters all competing for our attention . Those once-purposeful , relentless camera moves now just play as meaningless flash , and not even well-executed flash . Wan is coming off the world-conquering success of his wildly entertaining automotive action sequel Furious Seven , and he sometimes seems to be trying to bring the splashy cacophony of that movie into a world that thrives on sparseness and focus . It doesnt work . The first film had hinted that the next mission taken on by Ed and Lorraine Warren ( Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga ) , the real-life demonologists whose cases have inspired the series , would be the infamous Amityville haunting . The Conjuring 2 does kick off in the Long Island town , with a messy , violent , and not particularly scary sequence of psychic Lorraine inhabiting the memories of a young man who killed his entire family . But it moves on instead to a similar haunting in Enfield , England , ( also , the filmmakers insist , inspired by real events ) where single , impoverished mother Peggy Hodgson ( Frances OConnor ) and her four kids are contending with possessed rocking chairs , creaking swings , eerie tents , and a zoetrope come to life . I wont reveal too many details but to say that it appears that the ghost of a creepy old man is lurking about , insisting that the house is his . Throughout the Hodgson familys ordeal , Wan cuts repeatedly to the Warrens",OZP_Doc2_TheConjuring2,OZP,Horror,Negative,The Conjuring 2
122,OZP_Doc3_TheConjuring2,"Horror movies often rely on a certain amount of naive or foolhardy behavior to keep the plot moving and the tension high . Theres a vicarious thrill in watching a sympathetic protagonist ( or a deserving schmuck ) walking unawares into here-be-monsters territory . But there has to be a limit to dumb , erratic , or unbelievable behavior . AHHHH NO WHAT ARE YOU DOING DONT GO IN THERE AHHHH is scary fun the first few times it happens in a film . The third or fourth time around , it starts to wear thin , especially when the characters have already been burned several times but still keep sticking their hands into the fire to see whether its hot . Thats one of the many problems with The Conjuring 2 : no matter how many pants-wetting , throat-clenching , hysterical-weeping-under-the-covers moments the main characters have , theyre still improbably ready to take slow , tense , solitary walks through the darkened rooms of an extremely haunted house , staring into pitch-black corners , just waiting for something to lunge out and grab them . That willingness to face blithering terror makes sense for paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren ( Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga , returning from 2013s The Conjuring ) . They believe God has called them to help the haunted , and Lorraines psychic powers dont always let her choose whether to be involved in spooky stuff . But for single mom Peggy Hodgson ( Frances OConnor ) and her four kids , who live in a British council house where a malevolent spirit keeps attacking them from every available dark space , the casual approach to nighttime rambles around the house makes no sense . Conjuring 2 tries to keep the audience on edge with horror . It also improbably tries to reset everyone back to normal daily life every few minutes . Thats one of a couple of ways the film keeps working against itself . Director James Wan ( Saw , Insidious , the first Conjuring ) and his co-writers started with a real-life story , and the mundane facts they borrow do n't fit well with their horror-movie elaborations . From 1977 to 1979 , the real Hodgson family reported a series of poltergeist events in their house : moving furniture , spooky voices , an unseen force levitating the children . The claims attracted considerable press attention and got investigators involved , including police , researchers , skeptics , and the real-life Warrens . Wan and the other writers ( Carey and Chad Hayes , who wrote the first Conjuring , and David Johnson , who scripted Orphan ) keep some of the timeline and many of the historical names , but ramp the haunting up to a murderous degree . In the real-life case , many of the investigators wrote the whole thing off as a hoax , especially after two of the Hodgson children , Janet and Margaret",OZP_Doc3_TheConjuring2,OZP,Horror,Negative,The Conjuring 2
123,OZP_Doc4_TheConjuring2,"What 's worse : Being attacked by a ghost , or being attacked by skeptics who do n't believe your ghost story ? That 's the big question behind The Conjuring 2 , a sequel to the shockingly profitable hit , which flies husband-and-wife paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren from 1971 New England to 1977 London , where they tangle with the Enfield Poltergeist , a real-life case that 's still hotly debated as a fraud . Over a montage of British iconography Margaret Thatcher ; guards in furry hats ; punk rockers ; and working-class , chain-smoking children director James Wan blasts The Clash 's `` London Calling , '' even though that wo n't be released for another two years . Maybe Lorraine ( Vera Farmiga ) , a mentalist , psychically predicted it ? Our victims are single mom Peggy Hodgson ( Frances O'Connor ) and her four kids , broke wretches with accents borrowed from the Cratchits . ( Some of the child actors were forced to wear crooked false teeth . ) Their row house is in shambles even before the cabinets start shaking . The paint is peeling , the walls are smudged , and the wood floors look rotten and damp . When Peggy confesses that her louse ex-husband kept the previous owner 's furniture , an old man named Bill Wilkins who died in a downstairs chair , we are n't surprised . The wake was probably the last time the place got cleaned . Alas for youngest daughter Janet ( a heartbreaking Madison Wolfe ) , the man 's ghost likes to torture her with pranks . At first , it 's minor annoyances , like hidden remote controls and locked doors . Quickly , it escalates with Janet delighting newscasters by channeling the dead man 's voice . If you read English papers in 1977 , Enfield was a major story . A police woman went on record as seeing a chair skid across the floor , and over 30 other witnesses reported being hit with hot-to-the-touch Legos or seeing Janet levitate through her bedroom window . Mostly , however , Janet 's possession was dismissed as a hoax , especially when photos of her levitations just looked like an 11-year-old girl jumping off the bed . Enter the Warrens ( Patrick Wilson and Farmiga ) who fly overseas and spend three-quarters of the film wondering if they should trust their minds or really , their hearts , as Farmiga 's empathetic Lorraine has the kind of watery blue eyes that flood with tears . Wan and his co-screenwriters David Leslie Johnson and Carey and Chad Hayes try to have it both ways . They linger on the scenes of the Warrens ' reluctance , but tell us up-front in the first act that Janet 's terror is real .

No I really mean it . Its a tribute to director James Wans skill set and confidence that he puts the brakes on the story to give us this bizarre albeit strangely touching sequence but by then I was so irritated by Wans choice to extend nearly every scene beyond its stretching point and to poke us and prod us with essentially the same handful of scare tactics again and again and AGAIN that I wanted to reach through the screen and smash that acoustic guitar , a la John Belushi taking down Stephen Bishop in National Lampoons Animal House . The unimaginatively titled The Conjuring 2 is the follow-up to Wans razor-sharp supernatural thriller ( it was called The Conjuring , as you might have surmised ) . The 2013 original was a stylized and fictionalized version of the supposedly true-life , harrowing exploits of husband-and-wife team Ed and Lorraine Warren ( Wilson and Vera Farmiga , both quite good ) , who claim some of the most well-documented cases ever of haunted houses , demons , possessed girls who wind up crawling on the ceiling and speaking in that classic Linda Blair Exorcist voice you know , that sort of thing . The Conjuring was pretty cool because it fused cutting-edge camera moves and special effects with old-school horror in lieu of torture porn nonsense , i.e. , blood and guts squirting all over the screen as a substitute for genuine storytelling . Wan retains his touch for ratcheting up the tension , providing doses of comic relief and then BOOM ! , delivering another gotcha moment that will leave audiences jumping in their seats and then giggling at the visceral thrill ride but the scary moments arent as fresh this time around , and with a running time of 2 hours , 13 minutes , The Conjuring 2 is at least a half hour too long . At least . After an unnecessary prologue revisiting the Amityville Horror story ( I still aint buying it ) , and a sequence set on a TV chat show where Ed loses his temper when a professional skeptic casts doubts on the Warrens work , we finally get to the primary setting for the film : a house in a working-class neighborhood in Enfield , England .

The second worst might be Marilyn Manson in a convent . Get you a horror movie that can do both ? The Conjuring 2 , for instance , which takes its titular digit quite seriously , with two spooks and about twice as many jump scares as the 2013 original and made on a budget twice the size , to boot . With a $ 40.4 million opening weekend , The Conjuring 2 is already a success , and that was a foregone conclusion : its a franchise movie by James Wan . As the director of Saw , Insidious , The Conjuring , and the recent smash Furious 7 , Wan has proven himself quite the franchise whisperer . Saw spawned six sequels ; Insidious , two ( and a prequel ! ) ; The Conjuring , the current sequel and the spinoff Annabelle . Furious 7 was the highest-grossing film of its franchise , and more importantly ( ? ) like most of Wans movies , its pretty good ; a free-falling , ludicrous delight , the best-cooked version of a meal whose recipe will likely always taste good . Wans movies are all made of the same basic stuff : good-enough actors and handsomely over-the-top plots put in service of precise , effective direction . His priorities are studio priorities . ( Is it any wonder he was poached by Warner Bros. and DC Comics to helm the upcoming Aquaman ? What took so long ? ) In the heat of this summers franchise fever , you might settle into the same romantic complaint about commerces chokehold on original art , but here comes Wan , again , delivering another wildly successful summer movie that exemplifies , if not incredible vision , the kind of tried , true , classically satisfying summer moviegoing thats proving just as elusive as stark originality . The Conjuring 2 is based on the infamous Enfield Poltergeist Bill Wilkins , the aforementioned mean old guy that made a mess of the English press in the late 70s , in large part because it was widely decided to be a hoax . Wan sets up shop in the home of the Hodgsons , a fatherless , four-sibling family living in a tight and untidy council house in Brimsdown , of Londons Enfield county , where both sky and skin are ashen with cold and rain .

So shit , I yelped , sitting all by myself , and basically spent the rest of the movie with my teeth clenched , afraid I might let out more unfiltered sounds of sheer terror . As the resident horror creep of Complex , I thought I definitely had this in the bag but instead I suffered a series of minor heart attacks , thanks to James Wan 's crafty camera tricks . The man knows how to turn an average jump-scare into something you piss your pants over . Instead of overused cuts , he 'll often do a long , reactive pan that lets you notice the changed element in the room , whether that be a creepy old man suddenly lurking behind you or a toy fire truck rolling towards you in the middle of the night . It 's the kind of scare where you can see it coming but it still makes you jump out of your seat . Wan , who directed Saw , Insidious 1 and 2 , and both Conjuring movies , knows a thing or two about scaring his audience , and he uses everything he 's learned over the years to make Conjuring 2 this summer 's ultimate scream fest . It might also be the ultimate summer date movie .

In Enfield , a small township in England , single mother Peggy Hodgson ( Frances OConnor ) and her four children are under assault . There is something in their home , an entity that claims to be the 72-year-old former resident of their home , a man who had a heart attack and died there many years prior . The one most affected is youngest daughter Janet ( Madison Wolfe ) , the spirit using her as a vessel to deliver its ultimatums and unleash whatever chaos it can . But there is more going on , something even more malevolent behind the scenes , and at the urging of the Church the Warrens come out of their self-imposed seclusion to learn whether or not the Hodgsons claims of a supernatural assault are genuine or are instead nothing more than an elaborate hoax . Once again based on a supposedly true case of the paranormal witnessed by the Ed and Lorraine Warren , The Conjuring 2 reunites all the major players behind the surprise 2013 hit The Conjuring , including director and co-writer James Wan , fellow screenwriters Carey and Chad Hayes , composer Joseph Bishara , editor Kirk M.

It isnt going to surprise anyone that this second story revolving around Ed and Lorraine doesnt have quite the same impact as its predecessor .

His focus again is a documented case from the files of the Warrens of Connecticut , the shockingly white-bread demon fighters whose involvement with the so-called Amityville Horror put them on the pop-culture map and also made them objects of derision . Wans expert deployment of genre jolts is no less in evidence this time around , but as he takes his time perhaps even a bit too much of it interweaving the Warrens story with that of the Hodgsons , in the London borough of Enfield , he crafts a deep dive into dread . The film builds to a symphonic climax of heaven-and-hell emotion . The returning Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson imbue the roles of Lorraine and Ed Warren with the kind of lived-in nuance that illuminates their recent brilliant work on cable series Bates Motel and Fargo , respectively , shows that traffic in their own brands of horror . Along with an excellent Madison Wolfe , as the 11-year-old girl whos tormented by a restless spirit , or perhaps something worse , they lead an ace cast in a terrifically atmospheric plunge into 70s-vibe melancholy . Therell be nothing shocking about the features muscle at the box office . Where the first film found the Warrens in the relative anonymity of their pre-Amityville days , The Conjuring 2 is set a decade later , when the clairvoyant Lorraine has insisted they take a break from case work . Its not merely an attempt to lay low amid a mounting tide of talk-show scorn ; shes shaken to the core by a vision she had during their Amityville investigation brought to chilling life in the seance sequence that opens the movie . But when the Catholic Church requests their assessment of a troublingly intractable situation in England , they pack their Bible and go . The screenplay , credited to Chad Hayes , Carey W.

'' We see similarly raucous demonic situations in The Conjuring 2 , James Wan 's stylish sequel to his supernatural-horror hit of 2013 . The soundtrack plays Christmas carols , but there 's nothing silent about the nights in a house taken over by rude spirits , with the loud fuss meant to lure , then snare a pair of paranormal investigators . They are Lorraine and Ed Warren , a real-life couple played once again by the damn good actors Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson . They are deeply devoted to each other , their marital compatibility so persuasively conveyed by Farmiga and Wilson that you 'll swear you can still taste their wedding cake . Where The Conjuring took place in Rhode Island , this film splits its time on both sides of the Atlantic . We see the Warrens as comfortably middle-class , living in a home of shag rugs , wood-panelled walls and plaid furniture . Lorraine wears a crochet vest ; Ed sports statement sideburns . The seventies the horror ! The film begins with a flashback seance in Amityville , site of an infamous house and the dreadfulness within . Lorraine , who has a `` God-given gift '' for connecting with displaced spirits , is so traumatized by her experience there that she asks her husband that they no longer conduct on-site investigations . He agrees . Meanwhile , over in North London , a shambolic abode is dominated by a kids ' bedroom splashed with David Soul posters and television sets overwhelmed by flickering images of Margaret Thatcher . The domestic situation is not as cozy here , where four kids live in relative squalor . The mother ( played by Frances O'Connor ) is loving but overwhelmed . The two daughters , using a homemade ouija board , ask if their philandering father is coming back and one of the boys asks mum the same question . Signs point to no . Amid this gorgeously shot and smartly conceived 133 minutes of jump scares and chilling moments , there is a not-so-subtle religious subtext .

And then the movie demands the panic-stricken victim to sacrifice a kitten in a vain attempt to ward off the evil presence ... and in that moment , a deplorable line is crossed . For the remaining running time , no more is it our concern as to whether she is going to emerge from the experience in tact or unscathed ; the real hell eluded to by said title now becomes the movie theater , where moviegoers go from being surprised and thrilled to completely appalled by some contemptible plot decisions . After a certain point , the movie becomes our own cinematic damnation from which there is no escape . The movie is the brain child of Sam Raimi , who was made famous in this genre early on with the `` Evil Dead '' series , and then departed the trenches of B-movie horror comedy in favor of loftier Hollywood ambitions . The results were eclectic but effective , yielding the marvelous `` A Simple Plan , '' a taut thriller called `` The Gift , '' and the box office triumph of the first three `` Spider Man '' movies . Somehow , after those achievements , Raimi 's mind convinced itself that revisiting the past was a wise decision , perhaps strengthened by the noting that more money for a film budget was as his disposal , and the support of a major studio would give him certain freedoms with this approach that were not allotted to him so many years prior . Sometimes , they say , the past is better left there . The movie stars Alison Lohman as Christine Brown , the would-be heroin of the story , who is basically a collection of insecurities masquerading around under the veneer of opportunistic intentions . She is a financial consultant at a bank , vying for an assistant manager position and doing nearly anything possible to try and impress her indecisive boss , who is also considering a potentially more qualified candidate for the job .

Let 's not confuse Dong with Vinny , however , who would literally cry if the breeze hit him the wrong way . Dong would really only cry when we teased him and we soon found , as little shit kids love to do , the easiest way to push the poor lad to tears . `` Dong , the gypsies are coming , '' we would chant . `` The gypsies are coming to take to you away . '' Even though we had no idea what a gypsy was or why they were purported to steal children , such provocation turned Dong into a blubbering mess . Once he even threw at chair when someone pushed him too hard . I hope to hell that poor Dong does not see Drag Me to Hell , Sam Raimi 's return to the splatter flick genre that made him famous after years making mainstream blockbusters such as Spider-Man . See , Drag Me to Hell features one very pissed off Gypsy woman who , like all Gypsies must do in horror films , curses poor Alison Lohman 's Christine after she refuses to grant her an extension on her housing loan . More a comedy-horror in the vein of Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness rather than a film created to inspire fear in the hearts of intrepid viewers , Drag Me to Hell allows Raimi the opportunity to return to his old tricks of Three Stooges-type body humor and a chance to play with beasties that spew goo and like to scream in distorted voices . See , poor Christine is n't all bad . A momentary lapse of better judgment and the desire to wrest a promotion away from a brown-nosing , shitbag colleague ( Reggie Lee ) informs her decision to foreclose on the Gypsy 's house . Call it the wrong place at the wrong time , but this choice gets Christine a one-way curse to hell when her despondent client sics an angry demon on her ass . Unfortunately , Lohman does not possess the natural charisma Bruce Campbell brought to the Evil Dead series and her ersatz charm is not enough to carry the picture . Supporting players like boyfriend Clay ( Mac-guy Justin Long ) and spiritual guru Rham ( Dileep Rao ) have neither the acting chops nor the script to be anything more than incidental characters . So the entire production rests on the shoulders of Lohman and her battle against an invisible goat-demon named the Lamia . Raimi will never be a great filmmaker , but Drag Me to Hell is more a series of squirm-inducing scenes than a cohesive film . Sure , there are plenty of gross-out scenes ( including a classic battle between Christine and the Gypsy in a moving car ) ,",JLL_Doc2_Drag_Me_To_Hell,JLL,Horror,Negative,Drag_Me_To_Hell
132,JLL_Doc3_Drag_Me_To_Hell,"Drag Me To Hell is one wild ride of a movie . It is a Sam Evil Dead Raimi horror flick told in a campy manner . The audience gets a chance to laugh between the gasps and screams . Allison Lohman and Justin Long star in the film but the one who steals the show is Lorna Raver . Christine Brown ( Lohman ) works as a loan officer at a bank . She is in the running for an Assistant Manager position but her boss ( David Paymer ) tells her she has to be more aggressive if she wants the new position . When an old lady named Mrs. Ganush ( Raver ) comes in and asks for an extension on her home loan Christine says no . Mrs. Ganush becomes so incensed that she puts a curse on Christine . She later puts up a fight that is an amazing scene to watch . After being cursed Christine finds her life unraveling . She convinces her boyfriend Clay to take her to a psychic ( Dileep Rau ) . He tells her that a demon will come and drag her to hell if she doesnt get the curse lifted . The rest of the movie shows Christine being attacked by otherworldly forces and trying to come up with a way to get the curse reversed . Oh , and she also tries to just go on with her life . She really does come across as nave and dumb . Lohman does a good job of conveying Christines insecurities and desperation . She is convincing in her portrayal and has you cheering for Christine to succeed . Long is strangely bland as the boyfriend . He has a few humorous lines but they dont even justify him being in the movie . Plus there is zero chemistry between him and Lohman . The star of the movie is Raver . She is a demon and a half as Mrs. Ganush . The role requires her to suffer quite a few indignities but she is always ready to do whatever is necessary for her art . If that means taking out her teeth or taking out her eye , shes willing . The movie is rated PG-13 for profanity and violence . Drag Me To Hell goes a little bit over the top before it ends , and loses any semblance of reality in the cursed setting . The jokes tend to get better but the plot gets worse . The audience should be able to rely on the story at least making sense as to what works against the occult and what doesnt . When the movie ends it is with disappointment as to how it all turned out . It is a funny , horror ride that breaks down in the end .

133,JLL_Doc4_Drag_Me_To_Hell,"In Sam Raimi 's revenge-of-the-gypsy horror flick Drag Me to Hell , Alison Lohman takes one grotesque liquid after another in the face . She also suffers what might be cinema 's most epic nosebleed , almost drowns in a muddy grave , and generally gets bashed around . A less dignified role for a young actress would be hard to imagine , but then if you want dignity you do n't look to Sam Raimi in his manic-diabolical B-movie mode . Raimi , the cult-favorite auteur behind the madly inventive and sensationally entertaining Evil Dead series , has been playing with the big boys lately ( his last three films were the highly lucrative Spider-Man trilogy ) . Drag Me to Hell is his welcome-home to the low , disreputable fun of his drive-in-schlock roots . But there 's a note of mean-spiritedness I have n't detected in his work before . The movie is manic and gross , all right , but not much fun unless you enjoy watching an attractive 29-year-old woman getting punished repulsively over and over . It should be a big hit with guys who collect bukkake porn . Lohman , in the role of nice but eager-for-promotion loan officer Christine Brown , is being punished for refusing to grant an old gypsy woman ( Lorna Raver ) an extension on her mortgage . Raver , a TV veteran , is required to remove her dentures in lurid close-up and beg Christine on her knees for mercy and that 's before she reappears as a grasping , murderous harridan . Drag Me to Hell certainly expresses disgust at ambitious young women and destitute old women ; the gypsy is still doing revolting things even when she 's dead . Christine 's callousness has brought a curse upon her , and the old crone does n't just want to send her to hell outright she wants Christine to suffer first . All right , setting aside the film 's troublesome misogyny , Drag Me to Hell is clearly intended as a Saturday-night flick to make teenagers howl and squeal and gag . Most of it is n't scary , though . `` I recognize terror as the finest emotion , '' Stephen King once wrote , `` and so I will try to terrorize the reader . But if I find that I can not terrify , I will try to horrify , and if I find that I can not horrify , I 'll go for the gross-out . I 'm not proud . '' Raimi is n't proud , either . The style is disappointingly earthbound coming from a man who once had to make his own cheap camera mounts to get the insane , looping shots he wanted a good portion of Drag Me to Hell looks like television , and even the spooky stuff is largely a matter of bumps in the night and ooga-booga shadows .

134,JLL_Doc5_Drag_Me_To_Hell,"What can you say about a horror film whose title sounds like a bad Italian Western ? `` Drag Me to Hell '' what does that mean , exactly ? Does the lead character want to go to hell , or is director and co-writer Sam Raimi saying he feels as if he is being dragged back into a genre he left years ago ? Whatever the case , the lameness of the title its blunt descriptiveness , its lack of poetry or panache pretty much sum up the film that will follow . Far from a glorious return to gory horror by the mastermind behind THE EVIL DEAD and , more particularly , the magnificent EVIL DEAD II , DRAG ME TO HELL is a modest exercise in nostalgia ; it 's a bit like a reunion tour by an aging rock band running through a medley of their hits : it 's fun to see their routine again , but the magic is gone , and when the show is over , you realize you would be better off listening to the old albums instead of spending money on the new stuff . [ Warning : Spoilers ahead ] There is a pleasingly retro feel about DRAG ME TO HELL , which is clearly intended to be a fun and goofy form of gross-out horror . Sam Raimi clearly does not want to disturb you ; he wants to provoke you into shouting at the screen , more in excitement than in fear , as each new explosion of slime , muck , and bile reverberates through the theatre . Constricted by a PG-13 rating , Raimi can not deliver the gore ( except for a nosebleed that briefly gushes like a geyser ) , so offers up goo instead . The yuck factor goes off the scale at times ; you feel like you 're watching a 13-year-old brother 's attempt to disgust his sister by telling stories about squishing bugs . ( The eight-year-olds in the audience I attended , loved the film . ) That is not nearly enough to sustain a whole movie , however , and DRAG ME TO HELL suffers on a conceptual level . Sam Raimi and co-writer Ivan Raimi just do n't know what to do with their story , except use it as an excuse to string together the set-pieces . This worked in EVIL DEAD II because of the hell-bent-for-leather approach , but this time out , the screenwriting duo seem to be laboring under the delusion that they are telling a story with characters . They go out of their way to present bank loan officer Christine Brown ( Alison Lohman ) as an aspiring yuppie , someone who has dragged herself off the farm to seek success in the big city even if it comes at the cost of her soul .

Bliss ? Is frisson somehow appropriate here ? I guess it would all depend , largely , on how you feel about horror movies in the first place . But let 's say you do . Like them , that is . In which case , a tricked-out number such as Sam Raimi 's Drag Me To Hell , co-written by Raimi and his brother Ivan , will delight not just on the frenetic-fright level that Raimi set a certain bar for in his Evil Dead films of the '80s , but also for the ruthlessness with which it toys with viewer sympathies . To get into this a bit will require the use , alas , of some substantive spoilers . Which I will place , although perhaps not immediately , below the jump . Beware . Be warned . Raimi 's Evil Dead films , beginning in 1981 with the just regular Evil Dead , an ultra-low budget DIY landmark , conflated hysterical laughter with hysterical screaming by making explicit the always-present link between horror violence and slapstick . Raimi 's most obvious antecedents/inspirations were , of course , the Three Stooges , whose eye-gouging , strangulating , head-smiting antics would have caused grave if not fatal injuries if performed in earnest and in real life . Raimi upped the ante with gore , even more pronounced creepy/funny sound effects than you found in an average Stooges short , and a hyper moving camera style . Not to mention cutting that screamed `` Boo ! '' over and over again at breakneck speed . The pictures established him as a gonzo horror maestro , but on entering Hollywood proper he applied his style to a number of different genresthe superhero movie ( Darkman ) , the `` straight '' thriller ( A Simple Plan ) and even a baseball picture ( For Love of the Game ) . His work on the blockbuster Spider Man films mostly subsumed his innovative side , alas , and that 's one reason Drag Me To Hell 's got fans of his earlier work excited . As well they should be . Ultra-extreme vomiting and swallowing are among the shock effects Raimi 's added to the Dead bag of tricks , and they shift the horror action slightly away from Stooges territory and into the realm of great animation gagmen Tex Avery , Frank Tashlin , and Chuck Jones . Indeed , there 's a bit involving an anvil hanging from the ceiling of a toolshed that could have come straight out of a Road Runner cartoonand the bug-eyed reaction when the anvil drops is the live-action equivalent of one of the escaped-con-wolf 's double takes upon finding he",JLL_Doc6_Drag_Me_To_Hell,JLL,Horror,Positive,Drag_Me_To_Hell

Raimi returns to the kind of cheeky horror that made him a cult favorite with the low-budget `` Evil Dead '' trilogy , but he applies all the high-tech tricks he 's acquired with the blockbuster `` Spider-Man '' franchise . He and brother Ivan Raimi have written a rather old-fashioned terror tale , full of curses and creaks , bumps and shrieks , but they 've added a heavy splattering of their trademark dark humor . ( Some of the absurdly funny visual gags include creative uses for office supplies , a talking goat , a persistent fly and an unsuspecting kitty . ) The physical comedy is cartoony , but in a clever , classic way , and it never detracts from the genuine suspense . All these contradictions add up to one hell of a ride : You 'll squirm , you 'll scream , you 'll laugh your butt off and beg for more .

Shadows start following her and gusts of wind blow through her doors and windows , violently tossing her about the house . ( Raimi gets a little repetitive with the shock moments and their accompanying blasts of noise ; having said that , this is also where his newfound use of CGI comes in handy . ) But we could have figured out something was a bit off with Mrs. Ganush by the glass eye , rotting fingernails , jagged dentures and copious globs of phlegm she hocks up into her dainty handkerchief .

137,JLL_Doc8_Drag_Me_To_Hell,"HORROR is not just for the young , it 's about being young . All of the fears of the young feed into it and one of those is a fear of the old . It can be a mummy , a corpse , a vampire , a Sumerian demon or perhaps just an old woman with skin like an elephant and breath like the grave . Sam Raimi starts from that point with Drag Me to Hell , his first horror film in nearly a decade . The king of scaring teenagers in the '80s , Raimi created the low-budget classics The Evil Dead and its sequel , Evil Dead II , then Darkman and Army of Darkness . In the '90s he branched out into films with stars , largely away from horror : The Quick and the Dead , A Simple Plan , For Love of the Game , The Gift . For the past decade he has been in the big-time , making the three Spider-Man movies , with more budget than he can wish for and possibly less freedom . That may be why he wanted to return to something small , scary and disgusting . Drag Me to Hell is about one-quarter funny , three-quarters scary , but it has the basics - a fundamental knowledge of human frailty and fears and a desire to do something naughty . Ridiculous towards the end , it 's enjoyably gross throughout . We 're talking maggots in the mouth , a toothless corpse falling on top of the heroine , an old woman who oozes goo from seemingly every orifice , demonic flies up the nose . Blood , snot and tears , in fact . The film trades on a very modern fear of contamination . `` Did I get any in my mouth ?

Christine Brown ( Alison Lohman ) is up for a promotion at a soulless Los Angeles bank . The boss doubts she can make the tough decisions so she goes against her conscience and refuses a home-loan extension to an ancient woman , Mrs Ganush ( Lorna Raver ) . Big mistake . The old woman curses her with some powerful gypsy words and soon Christine is being visited by things with horns and cloven hooves . Raimi is old-school in the way he approaches horror : he uses shadows , sounds and suggestion rather more than computer-generated images .

138,JLL_Doc9_Drag_Me_To_Hell,"`` Drag Me to Hell '' is a sometimes funny and often startling horror movie . That is what it wants to be , and that is what it is . After scaling the heights with `` A Simple Plan '' ( 1998 ) and slugging a home run with the `` Spider-Man '' franchise , it 's like Sam Raimi is taking some personal time and returning to his hobby . He is greatly assisted by his star , Alison Lohman . Horror movies with nasty old men can be fun ( see `` Bride of Frankenstein '' ) , but for the mainline product there 's nothing like a sweet and vulnerable girl . Although in real life she 's pushing 30 , Lohman looks nowhere near old enough to be Christine , the bank loan officer . No wonder she has such a chaste sleep-apart relationship with her boyfriend , Clay Dalton ( Justin Long ) . I suspect they practice abstinence . If `` Clay Dalton '' rings a bell , those are surely two of the most common names in movies ; there have been 761 Clays and 413 Daltons . That 's the kind of elbow nudge Raimi likes to provide , especially since the character really requires no surname . The whole movie is nudges , especially scenes involving a cute kitten and Shock Reveals . Cute kitties of course are useful in the It 's Only a Cat ! false alarms , and Raimi deserves praise for not using this kitten in that way . Shock Reveals are of course the moments when a terrifying image explodes from the scene , scaring the split pea soup out of the heroine . Shock Reveals should logically be silent , unless the Revealed is screaming . But in horror films they always come with discordant chords and loud bangs . This is as obligatory as the fact that blades always make a snicker-snack noise even when they are not scraping enough something . It is essential that the heroine ( for horror victims are conventionally women ) be a good screamer , and man , can that Alison Lohman scream . Stanley Kubrick would have needed only a day with her on `` The Shining , '' instead of the weeks he spent with Shelley Duvall . Christine has reason to scream . An old gypsy woman with a blind eye and leprous fingernails asks her for a third extension on her home loan , and if there 's one thing I 've learned in this life , it 's that you never say no to an old gypsy woman with a blind eye and leprous fingernails .

Look at what happens to Christine , a very good egg boiled to perfection by circumstance and a lot of good work by Alison Lohman . One bad decision and suddenly director Sam Raimi throws her under the bus of his terrific new horror film , `` Drag Me to Hell . '' If you 've been worried that Raimi 's decade spent spinning the `` Spider-Man '' web might have caused him to go soft , well stop . The director who gave us the `` Evil Dead '' trilogy is back with a vengeance that rivals the one-eyed gypsy I warned you about . With that fire in his belly , Raimi 's `` Drag Me to Hell '' does everything we want a horror film to do : It is fearsomely scary , wickedly funny and diabolically gross , three stomach-churning states that argue for taking a pass on the $ 10 box of popcorn . Which also makes the movie an excellent economic investment in these tough times . I mention the economy because Raimi has made it an issue at the heart of `` Drag Me to Hell , '' in the spirit of campy cultural commentary that good horror can do so well . The director and his brother Ivan began the script 10 years ago before Peter Parker 's many tribulations in Spidey tights sidelined it . If the Raimis really are as prescient as `` Drag Me '' would suggest , I 'd like to put in a good word for them to be added to the Obama economic recovery team . You see , Christine is a lending agent at a bank and ambition has made her desperate for a promotion . The gypsy is old Mrs. Ganush ( Lorna Raver ) , who just wants a little of the candy on Christine 's desk and another extension on her home loan . Sounds reasonable to me . And it did to Christine too until her boss ( David Paymer ) hints that if she is serious about that promotion . . . So good , decent Christine goes against her better judgment and denies Mrs. Ganush 's request . Bad choice , Christine .

Even worse , he 's the kind of foodie who insists on watching someone consume the dish he cooked for them and informing them of how much the ingredients cost . In the film 's best scene , Stan 's character , Steve , pushes a plate of pasta topped with a single murderous meatball toward Noa ( Daisy Edgar-Jones ) , the film 's heroine , while holding forth on his personal journey into starting a monstrous meal-kit service as an instrumental version of `` Exit Music ( for a Film ) '' plays . It 's a facsimile of a bad date , where one party drones on about their interests and the other gets in the occasional question , only Noa is in chains , and before she takes a bite , she feels obliged to ask if the meat is her own .

It 's refreshing , then , to witness a new wave of bold female-directed horror movies that have effectively flipped the male gaze on its head while conveying the discomfort of violence against women , from Coralie Fargeat 's Revenge to Julia Ducournau 's Titane to Dasha Nekrasova 's The Scary of Sixty-First . Mimi Cave 's Fresh aims for a similar kind of genre corrective through a brazenly black comic allegory in which women are viewed as literally nothing more than meat to be consumed , except its tone-deaf cheekiness only results in a feeling of dreary regression . Cave and screenwriter Lauryn Kahn waste no time in comically illustrating the misogynistic hellscape that is the contemporary cisgender dating scene . As Fresh begins , its meek and lonely protagonist Noa ( Daisy Edgar-Jones ) is out on a date with a blustery , scarf-wearing bro named Chad ( Brett Dier ) . Truly living up to his name , Chad derogatorily comments on Noa 's outfit while launching into a diatribe about how women do n't dress sexy enough anymore , before also finding time to throw some racist barbs at the server at the Chinese restaurant where they 're eating . Akin to a sketch comedy 's take on a bad date , the scene makes valid observations but glosses over the more quietly insidious tactics that men regularly use to domineer women in favor of milking surface-level humor from ordinary douchebaggery . The night comes to an abrupt close when Noa diplomatically tells Chad that they 're not a good match and he responds by calling her a stuck-up bitch and walking away . Noa seems ready to resign herself to a life without love , but then along comes plastic surgeon Steve ( Sebastian Stan ) , whom she encounters at the grocery store in a meet-cute that feels too good to be true .

143,CMM_Doc4_Fresh,"Modern dating can make a girl feel like a real slab of meat at least , that 's the central thesis of Mimi Cave 's debut Fresh , a horror-comedy with its teeth filed down to stubs . `` Hopefully , this 'll make for a good story , '' Noa ( Daisy Edgar-Jones ) tells her BFF Mollie ( Jojo T Gibbs ) before she heads off on a date with the most blandly vile man you can imagine : he monologues about acid reflux , tells her she 'd look prettier in a dress , spouts some racism at their waiter , and then calls Noa a `` bitch '' when she does n't want to kiss him . When Noa gets back home , she tries to message another guy . He immediately responds with a dick pic . So who could blame her for ignoring every red flag presented by Steve ( Sebastian Stan ) , who approaches her in a grocery store and jokes about how cotton candy grapes really do taste like cotton candy . Steve seems all too perfect : he loves to dance in the middle of his living room , he does n't want to rush into sex , and he is n't on social media ( which the film treats as immediately suspect , but I would argue is the romantic ideal ) . Noa complains that dating reduces us all to `` the perfect projection '' , but she 's just as willing to play into romcom fantasy : she 's a `` pancakes out of a bag '' kind of girl , he 's a sophisticated cocktail connoisseur . As Mollie points out : `` It 's a straight girl 's fantasy come true ! '' It 's a very relatable sort of hypocrisy . And when Steve whisks Noa away for a weekend out in nature , we 're meant to read it as passionate and spontaneous right up to the moment the film 's title belatedly drops , around half an hour in , and we find out that he 's actually a cannibal . Not a hobbyist cannibal , mind you , but a professional one , carving up women for wealthy clients while keeping them chained in his basement so the meat stays fresh . But Cave 's film proves that there 's a clear difference between clever metaphors and satisfying ones . The way Steve looks Noa dead in the eyes and says `` I 'm taking your ass '' is a very dark but funny joke . And Cave , certainly , leans into the film 's tongue-in-cheek quality . Fresh is shot by cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski , known for his work on both Hereditary and Midsommar , and the camera lurches around Steve 's mid-century basement dungeon ( quite nice if you take it out of context ) in queasy disbelief at what 's going on .

The most common way to do it is via app , where in much the same way you 'd order chicken tenders for delivery you pick from a bunch of options provided by an algorithm . You know that algorithm is likely to let you down , so you just hope it wo n't lead you to certain death . It 's a boring , horrible way to think about people , at odds with the fundamental desire at the heart of dating : to be seen as a complete person by someone interested in you , and you in them . What 's more likely is objectification : Dating apps encourage users to reduce each other down to parts . To meat . The indie horror movie Fresh takes that familiar metaphor to a particularly literal extreme . The debut film from director Mimi Cave and writer Lauryn Kahn follows Noa ( Normal People 's Daisy Edgar-Jones ) , a young woman in the throes of dating ennui , dating boring , ridiculous men who feel at liberty to comment on her appearance , want to ramble exclusively about their own interests , and then insult her when she is n't interested in a second date , much less first-date sex . Steve ( the Marvel Cinematic Universe 's Winter Soldier , Sebastian Stan ) is different . Noa meets him in a grocery store the first of the film 's many delicious ironies . He 's charming , clever , and not interested in pressuring her for sex . Even though she barely knows him , Noa decides to go on a weekend getaway with Steve after only a few blissful dates . This turns out to be a mistake when Steve drugs her and imprisons her , with the plan to keep her alive and slowly sell her body as meat to extremely wealthy clients who have developed a taste for cannibalism . In spite of that horrific premise , there 's a comedic mean streak to Fresh that keeps it from getting too grotesque or grim starting with the film 's opening credits , which do n't kick off until 30 minutes into the film , when Steve makes his move . Stan effortlessly pivots from charm to menace in that role , operating in a mode not that dissimilar from Penn Badgley as YOU 's Joe Godlberg , albeit less sympathetic . Steve has been doing this to women for a long time . He 's a fully formed amoral monster , but a charming one who dances as he works and likes to banter with his victim .

We 've seen such narratives countless times before in horror , but recently , the latent subtext has become overt text . Sociopolitical commentary is the main thrust of so much contemporary horror , to often valuable but occasionally grating effect . Fresh , directed by Mimi Cave and written by Lauryn Kahn , tries to strike a balance between urgent messaging and pure , gnarly depravity . It suggests , in a few strained moments , that the film is perhaps a treatise on the perils of modern dating , particularly as experienced by straight and bisexual women who suffer a constant onslaught of bad menvainglorious pricks , not so subtle misogynists , and sometimes much , much worse . Which is a more than worthy subject for a filmindeed , it has recently been the subject of several , including last year 's Oscar-winning Promising Young Woman . But Fresh pushes its argument a bit too bluntly . Its declarative moments feel tacked on , out of some obligation , to what is otherwise a streamlined and thrilling feature that makes plenty of points without the broad gestures . Cave and Kahn stage the film with a dreadful build . We meet Noa ( Normal People 's Daisy Edgar-Jones ) as she goes on a bad date , bemoans how rough it is out there in the singles scene to her best friend Mollie ( Jojo T.

They fall into bed together and plan a sexyor maybe genuinely romanticweekend away together . We in the audience know that something is going to go wrong . Cave gently plucks a string of tension and lets it vibrate in the background , her film 's dark and moody color palette suggesting hidden menace . The trick of the film is that we really have no idea just how bad it 's going to get until , well , we find out in one ruthlessly bleak scene . Steve has a particular taste , it turns outa horror of all horrors . Fresh has mordant fun with the awfulness of its premise . Cave turns once quotidian activities into garish nightmares , a soundtrack of '80s rock-pop blaring away as Noa , harrowed but not defeated , tries to figure a way out .

When she serendipitously meets the sincere and charming Steve ( Sebastian Stan ) in the produce aisle of a grocery store , of all places things seem almost too good to be true , with her best friend , Mollie ( Jojo T.

'' While the film 's first 30 minutes set up the modern horrors of dating for the 30-something set and the expected redemptive narrative arc , `` Fresh '' upends itself ( and its audience ) with a sudden tonal shift that resolutely punctures the story world we knew , setting into motion instead a horror film that confidently refreshes generic conventions . With a sharply energetic script from comedy screenwriter Lauryn Kahn , `` Fresh '' willfully borrows from both comedy and horror in a way that destabilizes the use of each . It flirts not only with total disruption of audience expectation , but also with the boundaries of obscenity as it lands beat after beat of light-on-its-feet humor within a story world that is in all ways macabre . As too does its visual style , which is just as playful , amorphous and intentional as its script . While both stylish and mischievous , it also knows when to pull back , allowing for moments of vulnerability and a chance to sit with Steve 's horrific nature . In comparison to a film like `` I , Tonya '' ( coincidentally another Stan vehicle ) , `` Fresh , '' despite its consistent boundary-pushing , knows how to use its visual style and tone effectively . Here , violence against women is not reveled in , or embellished by an all-too-gleeful cinematography , but rather it rejects certain forms of visual spectacle ( while leaning wholeheartedly into others ) in a way that stands with , even cheers for , its women characters . While we are absolutely witness to the gruesome and grotesque here this is certainly not a film for the faint of heart `` Fresh '' knows exactly when and when not to push into its own lurid nature .

The deceptively meek , in reality adventurous British actress cycled through several bad boyfriends in the terrific Irish miniseries `` Normal People . '' Now starring in her first American feature , the outrageous Hulu thriller `` Fresh '' premiering Friday , March 4 , Edgar-Jones is a fed-up single in Portland , Ore. , who lets a charming dude sweep her off her feet . The man is played by Sebastian Stan , so she 'd better watch out . He 's the guy , after all , who elsewhere on Hulu is so convincing as rock 'n ' roll animal Tommy Lee . He plays the super assassin Winter Soldier too , for heaven 's sake ! Almost makes you want to ask , `` Daisy , what are you thinking ? '' Except , as an actress , she 's thinking quite well and choosing her projects wisely . While `` Fresh '' is intentionally not for every taste , it 's an uncompromising feminist horror/thriller with a fantastic lonely girl/victim/heroine for Edgar-Jones to play . Screenwriter Lauryn Kahn ( `` Ibiza '' ) and first-time feature director Mimi Cave give the actress a dazzling spectrum of emotions to play , all of which Edgar-Jones nails with apparent ease and precision . She does so even when , eventually , her character , Noa , has to defy all behavioral logic . It 's a mark of her talent that by the time we get to that point in the film , Edgar-Jones has laid enough multifaceted groundwork that we 'll go with whatever Noa does to get out of her predicament . `` Fresh '' feels like `` Get Out '' for a post- '' Tinder Swindler '' crowd . Act 1 is a sour comedy about Noa 's terrible online dating experiences . There 's palpable unease from the start , but terror does n't manifest until a half hour in along with the film 's opening credits , to signal that matters are turning dead serious . The bloody , extended final stretch is also where the film 's metaphor is made obvious , both through dialogue and with queasy images that speak mouthfuls about objectifying make that commodifying women .

150,BYM_Doc1_EQUILIBRIUM,"Equilibrium is my favorite movie of 2002 . It feels uncomfortable even typing those words , as they sound like the typical soundbite blurb-speak that passes for so much of film criticism these days . But it 's true : This medium-budgeted , futuristic action tale that arrives on screens with precious little fanfare is , to my mind , the best film I 've seen all year . It 's a movie that thrilled and moved and deeply affected me when I got the chance to see it at a very early advance screening last July , and has n't been out of my mind in the months since . I 've been heaping praise on it for so many months to friends , colleagues , family ... pretty much anyone who 'd listen that it almost feels like I 've written this review already . Writer/director Kurt Wimmer has delivered an intelligent and honorable riff on such science fiction classics as George Orwell 's 1984 , Aldous Huxley 's Brave New World , and Ray Bradbury 's Fahrenheit 451 , presenting a not-too-distant future where freedom has been traded for security ( a timely subject these days ! ) through the State-mandated use of emotion-suppressing drugs . War and crime and hate are things of the past in Equilibrium 's world , but so are art and creativity and love . This nightmare is presided over by the Big Brother-like dictator Father , and enforced by a quasi-religious order of `` Clericks , '' whose incredible combat skills are unleashed on `` sense offenders '' who have gone off the drugs that keep the populace docile . A terrifying future , to be sure , though not one without hope especially when Clerick John Preston ( Christian Bale , a much more impressive action hero here than he was fighting dragons in Reign of Fire ) accidentally misses his drug dose and begins to feel for the first time . I hesitate to reveal much more about the plot of Equilibrium , jammed as it is with surprise and invention suffice to say , this is an intellectual rollercoaster ride , as cerebral as it is visceral ; both a bleak glimpse into a possible future and a stirring tribute to the indomitable human spirit . Though the film gets immeasurable mileage out of its cinematography , stunning futuristic production design , and music ( an awesome neo-Wagnerian choral score by Klaus Badelt , a frequent collaborator of Hans Zimmer ) , it 's ( not surprisingly ) the performers who give the proceedings so much gravity . Bale has never been better , combining the sleek coldness that served him so well as Patrick Bateman in American Psycho with a heartbreaking portrayal of a man rediscovering his lost humanity ( and paying for the recovery of that humanity : Wimmer cleverly has the violence become more intense and wrenching as Preston learns to feel again ) .",BYM_Doc1_EQUILIBRIUM,BYM,Sci-Fi,Positive,EQUILIBRIUM

I thought about Orwell he 'd probably approve of this film . The center for which all the soldiers come from is called `` Equilibrium '' or balance as it is layman 's terms ; they 're all injected with an opium drug that they carry that numbs their emotions and sense of guilt while they 're controlled by the heavily armed heavily secure government facility . Paired with incredible direction and writing by Kurt Wimmer and sleek stylish cinematography by Dion Beebe , we 're given a glimpse into a world that 's still imperfect despite it being under control . In a society now completely void of emotion , heavily armed guards patrol the streets with the use of their skilled warriors called the Grammaton Clericks , a band of sleek swift emotionless soldiers who can take on a horde of rebels without breaking a sweat . Their best soldier is Sean Preston , an emotionless professional and violent soldier who one day remembers his wife whom he betrayed to be killed for feeling and now his memories begin flooding back as well with his emotions after he betrays his partner Partridge ( Sean Bean ) who he discovered with a book . Now , as his memories come back and emotions emerge , he must keep his emotions in tact while attempting to help the rebels and stay one step ahead of his eager young partner Brandt ( Taye Diggs ) a soldier almost equal in skill and abilities who is anxious to discover his secret and further his own career . The soldiers sit in a stadium where they 're fed messages from the high father who watches over Libria , and everyone is monitored for emotions ala `` 1984 . '' Those found with contraband including books , records , literature or art are killed and then the contraband is properly burned ala `` Farenheit 451 '' . It 's obvious by looking at the facility that the government does n't have much faith in their process as they watch everyone , including their best soldier Preston . He himself is plagued with traces of emotions and his haunting memory of selling his wife out to the authorities causing her death all the while hiding his emotions from his colleagues and his young son who is also being tailored as a clerick and watches him like a hawk as well . Christian Bale portrays a warrior without emotion , a warrior who kills without mercy and then must slowly progress into a man who 's emotions are slowly coming back to him and express his realization towards those emotions , and Bale handles it with impressive range and incredible depth.Diggs play well against Preston as his rival constantly monitoring him and attempting to outdo him while Preston must stay one",BYM_Doc2_EQUILIBRIUM,BYM,Sci-Fi,Positive,EQUILIBRIUM

It offers for the viewers of the more low rent sci-fi films the required martial-arts fight sequences and plenty of metallic techno gadgetry ; and , it appeals to a more arty audience by its cleverly created totalitarian gothic set design of mixing actual Berlin locations with CGI effects . Nevertheless , it fails overall to arouse interest dramatically , conceptually or inventively . I 've seen this film 's theme played out too often ( and in a more spirited way ) in recent films to find its well-intentioned virtues necessarily welcome or pleasing . It only adds unneeded celluloid to an increasingly tired genre ! Director-writer Kurt Wimmer ( 1995- '' One Man 's Justice '' ) , a screenwriter for such films as the 1998- '' Sphere , '' the 1999- '' The Thomas Crown Affair '' and the 2003- '' The Recruit , '' never got this 'baby ' off the ground . The banal dialogue was risible ( a prime example has the humanist heroine played by Emily Watson in all seriousness state : `` Without love , breath is just a clock ticking '' ) , the main action hero , Christian Bale , was miscast . His stiff actions were too self-conscious and deliberate to fill the role of an action hero . The bleak settings were uninspiring ; the overall grey effect was more stunting than enlightening . What becomes most annoying is that it strings together a bunch of cliches from just about every sci-fi film and the melodrama never becomes anything more than a silly exercise in acting silly . It 's a film that , quite frankly , offers little entertainment value or much of anything else ( it even fails to answer most of the challenging questions it raises about state-controlled suppression ) . Equilibrium takes place in a futuristic world in the 21st-century post-WWIII . It resembles a fascist state where books are burned and no emotions are allowed in the belief this will prevent an uprising and another world war . John Preston ( Christian Bale ) is the highest ranking Grammaton ninjalike cleric in Libria , where he 's a police enforcer ( using a new fight technique called `` Gun-Kata '' ) going on missions to root out all rebels who have n't taken their required daily dose of the emotion suppressing Prozium ; and , he 's also around to rid the world of literature , art and sentimental relics of the past .

With no pretentious psychobabble to distract or simply rehashing old plots , Equilibrium sticks doggedly to its storyline and is bound to please action movie fans . After World War III it is decided that human nature or rather human emotions to be specific are to be blamed for man 's destructive history . This conveniently forgets that the reason for the last major international war ( America invading Iraq ) was actually about keeping gas-guzzling SUVs on the road . It is however decided to change human nature by putting the entire population on a self-administered drug called Prozium ( geddit ? ) which is designed to eliminate any emotions . Far easier I 'd say to destroy all those ugly , unsafe and polluting SUVs but I guess people just ca n't bring themselves to part with the ungainly beasts . ( Is it just me or do they all look like CPU cooler fans on wheels ? ) Putting the entire population on Prozac , er sorry , Prozium does n't seem to be particularly successful though . There may not be any wars , but the level of violence employed by the fascist dictatorship that administers the drug to its citizens in destroying so-called `` sense offenders '' ( or people who have stopped taking the drug ) is high enough to rival any gang skirmish on the streets of L.A . In fact , the new government led by Big Broth . . . , er sorry Father , actually went to the trouble of devising a new martial art blending gunfight techniques with traditional kung fu and the like called `` gun-kata '' . This new martial art ( it looks like John Woo gunfights on overdrive ) is employed by special agents of the government appropriately called `` clerics '' ( they wear long black cloaks similar to those of Keanu Reaves in The Matrix Reloaded ) .

One of these `` clerics '' ( Bale , now all buffed up after American Psycho and ready to don the action hero mantle left behind by Arnold Schwarzenegger now that he is pursuing a political career ) stops taking his medication and soon finds himself in conflict with the same regime which he has been so zealously defending all his life .

It does n't do a lot of deep thinking , but unlike many futuristic combos of sf and f/x , it does make a statement : Freedom of opinion is a threat to totalitarian systems . Dictatorships of both the left and right are frightened by the idea of their citizens thinking too much , or having too much fun . The movie deals with this notion in the most effective way , by burying it in the story and almost drowning it with entertainment . In a free society many , maybe most , audience members will hardly notice the message . But there are nations and religions that would find this movie dangerous . You know who you are . The movie is set in the 21st century -- hey ! that 's our century ! -- at a time after the Third World War . That war was caused , it is believed , because citizens felt too much and too deeply . They got all worked up and started bombing each other . To assure world peace and the survival of the human race , everyone has been put on obligatory doses of Prozium , a drug that dampens the emotions and shuts down our sensual side . ( Hint : The working title of this movie was `` Librium . '' ) In the movie , enforcers known as Clerics have the mandate to murder those who are considered Sense Offenders . This is a rich irony , since True Believers , not Free Thinkers , are the ones eager to go to war over their beliefs . If you believe you have the right to kill someone because of your theology , you are going about God 's work in your way , not His . Christian Bale stars in `` Equilibrium , '' as Cleric John Preston , partnered with Partridge ( Sean Bean ) as a top-level enforcer . Nobody can look dispassionate in the face of outrageous provocation better than Bale , and he proves it here after his own wife is incinerated for Sense Offenses . `` What did you feel ? '' he is asked . `` I did n't feel anything , '' he replies , and we believe him , although perhaps this provides a clue about his wife 's need to Offend . Preston is a top operative , but is hiding something . We see him pocketing a book that turns out to be the collected poetry of W.B . Yeats , a notorious Sense Offender .

It 's set in someone 's zany idea of a future totalitarian state where guys in black leather are burning all the poetry but have n't gotten around to picking up the machine guns yet . As Keanu Reeves might say , whoa ! Boasting a handsome if over-digitized production and a bevy of male beauties as central characters ( there 's a big cheekbone thing going on here ) , the movie has evolved at least one degree from the dystopian broodings of Orwell . That is , its central conceit is based on antidepressants that were n't around in Orwell 's day . In this future , it is law that every day in every way , every citizen must take an injection of the drug Prozium , which reduces humankind to an efficient if narcoticized half-life . In exchange for this miasma of stupor , the folks do enjoy freedom from crime , aggression , jealousy and all those other messy attributes of what is called the Human Condition . But writer-director Kurt Wimmer takes this intriguing idea a little too far and ventures off into Cloud Cuckooland : Since art stirs feelings , art ( including poetry , drama and mein gott ! movie criticism ) is banned . Thus the reigning stud-pups of this future are an elite security cult , called Clerics . In obedience to `` Father '' ( the movie 's dim-bulb simulation of Orwell 's horrifying Big Brother ) they raid underground crypts and out-of-the-way apartments where heavily armed dissenters still bliss out on the Mona Lisa and Andy Warhol 's soup cans and the poetry of noted revolutionary Henry Wadsworth Longfellow . The plot proper turns on the adventures of Cleric John Preston ( Christian Bale , cheekbone rating 9.8 ) , who is a kind of mythically effective killing machine charged with blowing away Gerard Manley Hopkins readers with AK-47s .

First major league directorial project for scenarist Kurt Wimmer misses with its blowhard treatment of a silly , obvious script . Results might hazard `` Battlefield Earth '' comparison if new pic were a tad more fun . Nonetheless , there are unintentional laughs here , ones most likely to be picked out by fantasy fans in a home-viewing future that looms far more immediate than pic 's vision of tomorrow . Requisite opening text-crawl-plus-windy-voiceover informs us that once again , World War III has happened , wreaking such devastation that survivors have surrendered all control to the Grammaton Cleric , a mysterious authority whose strictures are designed to prevent WWIV . He/it has determined that man 's inhumanity to man is fueled by his ability to feel . Hence everybody 's on heavy doses of Prozium , which makes them think and behave in a neutral , obedient fashion . Subsidiary clericks like top-of-class John Preston ( Christian Bale ) are trained to intuit signs of sense offenses , thereby ferreting out persons who read books , look at paintings , listen to music , hide pre-Grammaton memorabilia , go off medication , or otherwise dare forbidden emotions . Offenders are invariably executed ; one such was Preston 's own wife , some years ago . The occasional nostril twitch suggests he perhaps was n't as hunky-dory with that event as he claims , though grade-school-aged son Robbie ( Matthew Harbour ) appears to be developing just fine into a droning little fascist-snitch .

157,BYM_Doc8_EQUILIBRIUM,"Science fiction is a good genre for creating visions of nightmarish future societies , but the awful future we see in `` Equilibrium '' is one we 've seen a few times too often . The movie -- a mish-mash of Ray Bradbury 's `` Fahrenheit 451 , '' George Orwell 's `` 1984 '' and several other 20th Century anti-authoritarian classics -- is about a post-nuclear-war world where war and crime have been eradicated , emotion has been banished and all the things that might provoke it , such as great art , poetry , literature and music , have been outlawed as well . Trapped in this world is John Preston ( Christian Bale ) , a `` cleric '' or supercop . His job is to track down art-hoarders and emotion-feelers and destroy their art works , just as it was Guy Montag 's job in `` Fahrenheit 451 '' to find hidden books and burn them up . Preston is the best there is , thought-policeman numero uno . And , as played by Bale , the fashion-conscious Wall Street maniac of `` American Psycho , '' he has the rapt body moves of a high-tech gun-toting samurai and the lean , high cheekboned , toned and trimmed look of a killer/supermodel . Bale is fairly credible even though he 's shown doing preposterous things like burning up the Mona Lisa or shooting his partner Partridge ( Sean Bean ) through a copy of Yeats ' poems . With his dead dark eyes , Bale can make stillness either menacing or poignant . As with most movie heroes of this type , Preston has a soft spot , and you know that sooner or later , he 'll turn , just as Montag went over to the book people in `` 451 . '' `` Equilibrium '' has an underground group of art-loving radicals who are deep within the bowels of the city , making bombs . Fairly soon , Preston has found them , fallen in love with captured and condemned dissident , Mary O'Brien ( Emily Watson ) , and is being pursued himself by his smug , smiling ex-partner Brandt ( Taye Diggs ) and his snaky little boss DuPont ( Angus MacFadyen ) , who has a few whopping surprises up his sleeve . Preston hardly has a character arc . He starts as a killer and continues as one , simply changing targets . But the movie tries to persuade us that his deeper sensibilities and sensitivity have been awakened by Mary -- and that , perhaps , the prozium-doped public may be aroused as well . Sure they will . `` Equilibrium '' has a sterile , steely surface -- it was shot mostly in modern-day Berlin in Nazi-era architecture -- and a trancelike rhythm to go with its derivative , punch-the-keyboard plot .

The plot -- brazenly pillaged from `` Fahrenheit 451 , '' `` 1984 '' and `` Brave New World '' -- concerns a high-ranking government `` Cleric '' named John Preston ( chisel-featured Christian Bale ) , a ruthless and deadly law enforcer in a `` Metropolis '' -styled dystopian future where emotions ( and by extension , music , art , poetry , etc . ) have been outlawed . The populace takes twice-daily doses of a stupefacient called Prozium , but when passionless Preston misses a couple injections , has a confusing day of emerging feelings , then finds himself staring into the big brown eyes of a cute little puppy he 's supposed to kill during a raid on a `` sense offender '' hideout ( insert shots of famous paintings being torched with a flame-thrower here ) , he ... just ... ca n't ... do it .

So , with classic governmental overreach on the horizon , a new organization is formed : the Grammaton Cleric , whose elite soldiers have only one purpose to eradicate the true source of man 's inhumanity to man , which is his ability to feel . In walks John Preston ( Christian Bale ) , a first-class cleric , tasked with wiping out yet another stronghold of emotion and creativity a stash house of music , art , books , and various trinkets that reflect the remnants of traditional human society . In a rather unintentionally comical moment , Preston stares down the recovered Mona Lisa painting before ordering it to be burned . In this peaceful yet bleak future , any item that might spark feelings is dubbed EC-10 or `` sense offense '' material , which warrants immediate destruction . A drug called Prozium is administered to citizens at regular intervals ( mandated by alarm bells sounded off in the city centers and available at Equilibrium buildings ) , which helps suppress emotions on a personal , chemical basis . But despite all of these precautions , including Vice Counsel Dupont ( Angus MacFadyen ) routinely interviewing his staff , Preston 's partner Errol Partridge ( Sean Bean ) succumbs to the forbidden , finer things in life such as poetry by Yeats . After discovering Partridge 's indiscretions , John executes the man , betraying no emotion at all . Or does he ? With each criminal he apprehends , Preston begins to realize that living without feelings negates the very reason to be alive .

160,MEM_Doc1_The_Batman,"The Batman is a promise delivered by Matt Reeves and team as the Planet of the Apes director continues to impress with his ability to tell compelling stories in established franchises . This latest Batman tale is grounded , noir and detective based , and a highly realistic entry into the movie mythos of the caped crusader . Audiences will undoubtedly compare Nolan 's trilogy and Snyder 's recent iterations , both of which are worth reconsidering . And though audiences should feel a pressure to compare them , Reeve 's Batman film stands on its own legs 100 % of the time . There are healthy callbacks to the comics and previous movies , but The Batman is definitive and one of the few recent movies that audiences should see as soon as possible , in Dolby Digital or IMAX at that . The premise of the film finds Bruce Wayne ( Robert Pattinson ) has been Batman for around two years after losing his parents twenty years prior ; he notes that crime should have quieted down , but is actually on the rise . He blames himself for the rise because of overlooked layers of mob activity , dirty police , and shady politicians . When a high-profile politician is dramatically murdered , he teams up with Lt Jim Gordon to peel back the lies that hide a crucial mystery before its too late . Famed Batman characters such as Alfred , Detective Gordon , Selina Kyle/Catwoman , Carmine Falcone , Oswald Cobblepot , and the Riddler play key roles in the aftermath of the fall of the Maroni crime syndicate . And Reeves uses them to good effect in adding texture to a gritty mystery that Batman has to tease details from to solve . Even though the detective angle is new for the genre on film , the most impressive aspects of the film are the pacing , the score , the sound design , and the cinematography . For a three hour movie , almost every scene and cut feels necessary . If the film must be compared to Nolan 's trilogy , which will definitely be an argument for eons , Reeves ' avoidance of grandiose spectacle makes the moments where he does use CGI a little obvious . Nolan handled practical effects better , but both films had issues with the CGI when it was necessary . We 've never had this Batman on screen in live action before . The way he moves and talks , thinks and fights is completely different from anything audiences have seen before and it 's done extremely well . The most notable scene for is a car chase that 's the centerpiece of the trailer , but even better in the movie and five times as long .

No context is provided , it 's plain voyeurism and foreboding all at once . What immediately comes to mind is the eerie suspense of Rear Window or Jake Gittes ' own binocular surveillance in Chinatown . Shortly after , we 're introduced to an unhinged and demented Riddler ( played maniacally by Paul Dano , who is not a stranger to psychotic performances , i.e. , Prisoners ) in one of the most chilling Batman scenes to date . Later on , a narration is heard from a rugged and tempest-tossed voice that seems familiar yet nothing like we 've heard before . It 's the Caped Crusader we 've known for many years ( played with care and vindictiveness by Robert Pattinson ) , but there 's a gruffness to his cadence and a timbre of anxiety that places him closer to a neo-noir protagonist than a crime-fighting hero . The femme fatale , Selina Kyle , a.k.a . Catwoman ( played by the wonderful Zoe Kravitz ) , acts as both ally and foil to the bat while wrestling with her own demons . Both leads have a more than satisfying rapport together , but the film glosses over the part where their professional relationship becomes a more intimate one ( Also like noir , which usually fast-tracks this part ) . Oswald Cobblepot ( played by Colin Farrell in near-indistinguishable makeup ) , the gentlemanly club owner and friend of mobsters better known as Penguin , is plucked straight from the bat 's colorful rogues gallery . Alongside him is Carmine Falcone ( played by the raffish John Turturro ) , the infamous crime boss who has a stranglehold on every nook and cranny of Gotham City 's political systems . These noir elements certainly belong to a Batman film , but they play out in numerous genres to create a grimy and desolate environment that inhales fear and exhales vengeance . Despite the disparity in genre interests , director Matt Reeves strikes a worthy balance . It 's a part-serial killer mystery , part-superhero adventure , and part-crime drama stuffed in a 3-hour runtime that can feel loaded but never dull . Gone are the otherworldly features , intergalactic warlords , and flying mosquito aliens . The Batman harshly rips off the bandaid , and in its place are spreads of duct tape along with their uneven textures and angular divides . It 's grounded in realism but leveled with sharp reds and oranges as well as harsh shadows that viciously saturate the screen .

In May 1939 , one of the best superheroes of all time ( if not `` the '' best ) was created . Thanks to Bill Finger and Bob Kane : the caped crusader , Batman , was born . Ever since , there have been multiple reiterations of the classic hero , each having its own signature style and atmosphere . Like everything in life , there 's the good ( `` Batman Begins , '' 2005 ) and the bad ( the pantomime `` Batman and Robin , '' 1997 ) , albeit it 's always exciting to see a new movie about him . What 's most interesting about the various reincarnations is how they tackle the different moralities and concepts , as well as the exploration of duality within Bruce Wayne ( light and darkness ) thanks to the villains attached . Each villain brings a particular conviction to the table ; Scarecrow is n't going to allude ( or be intrigued ) by the same factors of Batman as The Penguin or Joker does . Instead , they have retained their own scrutiny and things to pick apart in wicked ways , some more than others . It has been almost ten years without a solo movie of the Dark Knight ( `` Dark Knight Rises '' ) , but the time has come at last . Matt Reeves ' rendition , `` The Batman , '' has arrived , and it was truly worth the wait . Reeves ' picture revolves around Gotham City 's underworld , where crime and drug use are at an all-time high since the death of a big crime boss , Salvatore Maroni . However , things take a turn for the worse when corrupt members of the government and the police department are killed by a sadistic killer , The Riddler ( Paul Dano ) . He leaves a trail of cryptic clues addressed to the one called 'The Batman ' ( Robert Pattinson ) .

Each of them fighting adversaries seemingly worthy of their ( and our ) attention . Now , it 's Robert Pattinson 's turn to convince audiences that he can save the day . And it 's a wild ride to hell and back . Our newest dark knight is a self-described `` nocturnal animal , '' narrating a story in 'The Batman ' that drips of allegory and intrigue . Presented by director Matt Reeves as a neo-noir , we are quickly introduced to old friends James Gordon ( Jeffrey Wright ) and Alfred Pennyworth ( Andy Serkis ) , as well as possible adversaries like Selina Kyle ( Zoe Kravitz ) , Oswald Cobblepot ( Colin Farrell ) , and Carmine Falcone ( John Turturro ) . This newest film version could have fallen into tired tropes and , with a running time of nearly three hours , easily relied on fandom to carry it over the finish line . But Reeves has more up his sleeves when it comes to investing in an interesting story . This comes in the form of The Riddler , masterfully played by Paul Dano . The Riddler is a sadistic killer who targets Gotham 's powerful figures using puzzles and manipulation . He does this from a distance , bringing Batman into the mix by devising clues that he must solve in order to save the day . It 's this version of The Riddler that makes one 's skin crawl , and leaves very little room for error . The Riddler is played not only as a supervillain , but also as a device to keep the story moving . Every clue that Batman tries to solve uncovers more truths of the past that continue to haunt the characters of the present . We are left to question who is really villainous , and who is impersonating the role of a hero all along . It is clear that Reeves was heavily influenced by detective fiction to craft a very dark and stormy plot . Reeves ' version is more moody than Nolan 's , more emo than Burton 's , less cartoonish than Schumacher 's , and possibly influenced by David Fincher . I could n't help but think about some of Fincher 's films ( 'Seven ' , 'Zodiac ' , 'Gone Girl ' ) where a tortured main character is tasked to solve riddles , created by a worthy opponent , in a race against time .

164,MEM_Doc5_The_Batman,"Matt Reeves ' The Batman is a meticulously crafted film that takes the character back to his pulpier , noir-driven roots to delightful results . It 's a genuine detective story that embraces the genre wholeheartedly and the nasty details inherent to it , meaning that Reeves gets to deliver not only riveting action set pieces but also truly unnerving horror set pieces along the way . One such moment is the film 's opening sequence . It is a disturbing tone-setter for the film that Reeves packs to the brim with visual references and homages , not just to Batman stories , but to the classic films whose influence only grows more palpable as The Batman goes on . On paper , this is a pretty straightforward scene . The Riddler infiltrates the home of Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell Jr. and murders him before beginning to deface his body with duct tape . But the true ingenuity of the work comes in how Reeves and Academy Award-winning cinematographer Greig Fraser stage and photograph the sequence . The Batman opens on a long shot , peering through a scope into Mitchell 's home . Though the audience is initially unaware of whose point of view this is , the agile movement of the camera , the visual artifice of the scope 's lens and the audible deep breathing all convey that this is distinctly putting viewers in someone 's shoes . Brilliantly , Reeves keeps viewers here for an extended period of time , forcing the audience to become voyeurs themselves , observing the internal lives of the Mitchell family . This sustained long-distance shot and foregrounding of voyeurism is directly reminiscent of the titular shot of Francis Ford Coppola 's The Conversation , in which a surveillance expert is hired to record a mysterious conversation happening in a public place from a great distance . With The Conversation itself , Coppola was pulling from similarly themed voyeuristic works such as Powell 's Peeping Tom and Antonioni 's Blowup . Years later , both Blowup and The Conversation would go on to serve as noted influences on De Palma 's Blow Out . Thus , through directly visually quoting this film , The Batman is aligning itself with a long lineage of films exploring voyeurism , a theme that will go on to become integral to its story . Also , within this first shot , Mitchell and his wife are seen playing with their son , who is dressed up as a ninja for Halloween . Upon first viewing , without any narrative context yet established , this martial arts-infatuated child with wealthy parents immediately conjures thoughts of a young Bruce Wayne .

Since 1986 , a primary goal of DC Comics , and by extension , Warner Media , has been to create new stories of Batman 's early years , and then capitalize on them . Director Matt Reeves and co-writer Peter Craig have crafted a tale that sets out to do exactly that . Effectively serving as `` Year Two , '' The Batman depicts the title character ( Robert Pattinson ) waging a war on crime in the bleakest of terms . Halloween approaches and foul play is afoot . Something is most definitely rotten , even per Gotham City standards . A `` truth '' seeker and self-ordained righter of wrongs calling himself The Riddler lays out his intentions to unearth the city 's darkest secrets and eliminate all who are connected . His latest victim is Mayor Don Mitchell , Jr. ( Rupert Penry-Jones ) . Armed with a cipher , a sophomoric understanding of crime fighting , a bullet-proof costume and a fast car , Gotham 's self-appointed right hand of vengeance , Batman , embarks on a crime odyssey the likes of which do not typically transcend the pages of detective comics annuals . It is n't long before more rogues come out of the woodwork . These nefarious characters include crime boss Carmine Falcone ( John Turturro ) and his right-hand man , or rather Penguin ( Colin Farrell ) , along with various Gotham notables .

A trusted ally , Commissioner Jim Gordon ( Jeffrey Wright ) , and a faithful butler , Alfred ( Andy Serkis ) , press on to keep Bruce from blinking into the abyss of self-doubt and inner turmoil . Batman 's bravery , determination and prowess are matched by Selina Kyle aka Catwoman ( Zoe Kravitz ) , whose family and friends are intertwined in the Gotham vice . Over the last two years , Reeves and WarnerMedia have been selling the world on the following elevator pitch which the filmmaker delivered during DC FanDome 2020 . `` I wanted to get into the mindset of the character , and I wanted to think of the psychology . For me , I think , one of the cool deep dive ( comics ) was Darwyn Cooke 's Ego . He 's confronting the beast that is Batman , and there 's a kind of duality .

Those include Kanye West saying or doing something totally outrageous , Donald Trump calling the 2020 presidential election rigged and an egotistical Bruce Wayne basking in his obscene wealth and heroism in equal measure . And now , writer-director Matt Reeves ' `` The Batman '' has eviscerated that third bullet point . But who is The Caped Crusader without all the flair , duality and unsettling humanity that has made him so fascinating to watch on the big screen all these years ? The short answer from the new film could also be determined after shaking a magic eight ball once : `` Reply hazy , try again . '' This irresolute reaction comes not just because `` The Batman '' is a stark departure from what we 've seen before theatrically . ( Honestly , it would have to be different in order to justify its existence just shy of a decade after Christopher Nolan 's superb `` The Dark Knight '' trilogy ) . It 's that `` The Batman '' reaches for an ingenious and compelling new way to tell a story about the thin lines between corruption , greed and nobility but ever so limply and always just out of its grasp . That 's a bit jarring to witness after decades of watching the masked vigilante , played before by a bevy of actors like Adam West and Ben Affleck , navigate these muddy waters with sleek confidence even while making questionable choices in the most dangerous situations . With Robert Pattison in the role , `` The Batman '' character is considerably precarious and apprehensive . However , he seems to also have a big heart and wants to be part of the change for reasons not based on pride or rage but something else he ca n't quite put his finger on ( and the movie , frustratingly , never tells us ) . Part of that pathos is due to age . We meet Bruce Wayne younger than we 've seen him previously and in an earlier era of Gotham City . It 's about 20 years after the brutal murder of his billionaire parents , which puts him at around 30 years old . He 's alone and mopey , though evidently not without hope that he can clean up the streets simply because he feels he must . That timid faith compels him to blindly align with law enforcers , even though we know their system to be contributing to the corruption , like lieutenant Gordon ( Jeffrey Wright ) , presumably because it 's the right thing an orphaned child should do to exact what he calls `` vengeance .

It may well win him favor with the studio , with the ticket-buying public , and with critics who calibrate their enthusiasm to box-office success , but it gets in the way of the kinds of transformative interpretations of the characters that would make the difference between a baseline movie and an authentically free and original one . The Batman is a vigilante who works with the cooperation of the police , who project a bat-sign into the sky , with a bright light , as a call to him and a warning to evildoers who anticipate him swooping in .

The latest crime scene is of that of Mayor Don Mitchell , Jr ( Rupert Penry-Jones ) , running for re-election on a family values platform that comes unraveled when his killer , The Riddler ( Paul Dano ) , arranges for surveillance photos of Mitchell and his side-squeeze , desperate Russian emigree Annika ( Hana Hrzic ) , to be emailed to all available media outlets there in Gotham City . The hunt for that side-squeeze , as well as The Riddler himself , leads The Batman to the sort of mob-controlled club where the elite can mix with the dregs and everyone has a good , felonious time . There he meets Selena ( Zoe Kravitz ) , a waitress in iconic boots who is also searching for that side-squeeze because she was not only her roommate , but also her best friend . At least . In no time at all , The Batman has discovered that Selena is a fellow vigilante , unnamed but the owner of many cats and a disguise that includes a pussy hat . They seem destined for each other , and not just because they both prefer getting around the mean streets of Gotham on motorcycles . Also in play are family secrets , political corruption , the inherent violence of the class system , and a drug trade of epic proportions . Rather than neatly folding these elements into a tidy plot , we get them sequentially , but not artfully . There is also a hint about just how unlimited the Wayne family fortune is and is the one element that is dropped almost as soon as it appears that should have been explored",MEM_Doc9_The_Batman,MEM,Sci-Fi,Negative,The_Batman
169,MEM_Doc10_The_Batman,"Somewhere inside The Batman there 's a taut , slow-burning , two-hour crime drama right out of the 1970s golden decade of film . Unfortunately , director Matt Reeves and co-writer Peter Craig gorged themselves on the Batman mythos and wound up creating a sluggish , over-stuffed draft of a mini-series awkwardly crammed into movie form . Falling in love with Gotham itself , they spend a lot of time presenting an interminable link-footage travelogue of characters driving to and fro , forgetting that Gotham on film has always been '70s-'80s post-bankruptcy New York City , the most over-exposed cityscape in film history . The last thing anyone needs is an extensive tour of such a standard-issue backdrop . During the film 's production , its creators also appear to have lost interest in their genuinely compelling central storyline , leading them to drown it in an indigestible gooey topping of expendable sub-plots . It 's as if they were thinking , `` We need to wedge in an emotional context involving a loyal family retainer here but get it over in as little time as possible ! Can we unnecessarily flag biographical connections between characters , please ? Oh , do n't forget to shoehorn in the irrelevant late cameo for a popular character ! We need urban blight cliches on set , please ! Can someone make up a new drug for no reason ? Give Wayne a secretary but only give her 20 words . Where are the sad orphans and pitiful drug users I ordered ? '' The reasons for The Penguin to even be in this film are tenuous at best while most other side-plots never even rise to the level of red herrings . However , very early in the film 's interminable running time was a scene that stunned me . Unfortunately , that scene was when Robert Pattinson 's Batman ( aka Bruce Wayne ) spies on Zoe Kravitz 's Selina Kyle ( aka Catwoman ) as she undresses . It 's a well-worn cliche that has always been tone-deaf to the fact that in real life even if it was Pattinson himself ogling a woman through binoculars it would still be creepy , disturbing , and gross . Miraculously , there are still film executives who feel that it is unrealistic , nay impossible , not to include footage dwelling on a hot female body in a way that does n't advance the plot , develop a relationship , or add any crucial subtext . Batman 's presence occurs while looking for a woman , Annika Koslov ( Hana Hrzic ) , who it turns out is hiding at Kyle 's apartment . While failing the Bechdel Test by permitting only the most stunted communication between the two women , the film prioritizes cramming in an insinuation that Kyle is bisexual . The film rejects the potentially more powerful idea that mutually supportive friendships are vital to working-class women with precarious",MEM_Doc10_The_Batman,MEM,Sci-Fi,Negative,The_Batman

Spielberg 's triumph with `` Schindler 's List '' was followed by the longest hiatus of his career , which was broken with ... `` Jurassic Park II '' , a lifeless sequel of the kind you 'd once have sworn he 'd never make - the single worst and most anonymous movie he 's ever directed ( `` Hook '' had its moments ) . His next two films were improvements ( there was nowhere to go but up ) : the first anonymous but not bad ( `` Amistad '' ) , the second bad but not anonymous ( `` Saving Private Ryan '' ) , but they were both pompous gestures which appear to have been designed to win still more awards ; and it was n't until eight years after `` Schindler 's List '' that the skilled director of old times re-appeared ( with `` A.I .

I 've even learned to welcome it when he makes decisions which infuriate me , so long as he makes them with the right kind of self-assured arrogance .

Yet , in the end , big deal . The story is a knockout , the action is taut , the future rich , dazzling and believable . Spielberg is to be particularly congratulated on how completely he has avoided the unimaginative dystopia of `` Blade Runner '' . The future we see here is a MIX of dream and nightmare , so convincing a mix that we ca n't always tell them apart . Here 's a measure of how good the movie is : in an interview , Spielberg revealed that he completely misunderstood the issues which drive the stories - and there 's simply no way of telling this from the finished product .

171,DSM_Doc2_Minority_Report,"Minority Report is the latest film from Stephen Spielberg that stars Tom Cruise as a cop from the year 2054 , who works in the pre-crime division of the Washington D.C police department . The division 's ability to stop murders before they happen is based on the psychic ability of three people who were mutant byproducts of a failed genetic program designed to help babies born from drug-dependent mothers . Cruise 's character , John Anderton , is motivated by the loss of his own son , who was abducted and murdered six years earlier . Accordingly , he 's a strong supporter of the controversial program , whose opponents feel it could potentially make an error and people might be wrongfully convicted , if not potentially rehabilitated . That action begins when Anderton is identified as a future killer , and he hits the road running . This may sound a little like The Fugitive , but in this case , you do n't know if the man on the run is -- or , rather , will be -- guilty . Based on a short story by futurist Phillip K. Dick , author of Blade Runner , the atmosphere of a dark world with high technology having gotten out of hand , almost as though it snuck up on us without our knowing , remains the theme . To remind us that we are n't controlled by technology , but are nonetheless overrun by it , there are frequent references to current-day familiarities , such as department stores and restaurants , such as The Gap and McDonalds , where impressively entertaining high-tech mass marketing gadgets know what you 've purchased before and offer new suggestions for consideration . ( Sounds like a visit to amazon.com ? ) Spielberg lightens up the tone with his signature wit and humorous quips and visuals now and then , as opposed to Ridley Scott 's more serious and consistently dark visualization portrayed in Blade Runner . As a plotline , Minority Report is intelligent , has a good consistent flow , is n't always predictable ( at least not that long before it happens ) , has many twists and turns with legitimate dead-ends , and above all , tells a plausible story ( even if the basic premise itself requires considerable suspension of disbelief ) . As Anderton begins to unravel the true story about the corruption behind the pre-crime program , he is lead even further towards his destination as predicted by the ` pre-cognitives ' who predicted his crime . To tell any more of the story would disclose too much ; besides , it is n't necessary . You know all you need to know here . The best parts of the movie are so good from the high-tech special effects to the light-hearted humorous moments to the good , steady flow of the action and plotline that the problems with the film are easily forgiven .",DSM_Doc2_Minority_Report,DSM,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority_Report

I actually find myself wondering if all the gripers here have actually seen Minority Report , as I just have , because I have to say that is one of the most gripping and involving movies I have seen in quite a while . The content is amazing - all the little details that put the audience firmly in the middle of the 21st century . Personally I can absolutely believe that technology will have advanced in the kind of ways portrayed in the film within 50 years . Just look back 50 years into the past and you should be able to see why . The lives of everyday people in the film , where they are scanned and advertised 'at ' all day every day , apart from an excuse for product placement ( and why not ? ) , certainly make you think about a world where 'they ' know your every move ( a future towards which we are already hurtling with some speed ) . The style is amazing - why the wooden balls ? Because they 're cool is why . I like to think that as we progress as a civilization we will keep a few such elegant idiosyncrasies knocking around . The plastic , chrome and glass sets , objects and architecture all looked clean and functional and the way that they suck the color out of a scene worked well and gave the film a distinctive palette . The cars are the best looking vehicles I have ever seen in a film . I have only one criticism here - why do all the computer displays look like Macs ? Surely a touch unrealistic ; ) The story is amazing - complicated , yes , but also engrossing , exciting and scary . There are elements here that are only hinted at , but which give the plot a depth increasingly lacking in modern action flicks . And it asks the kind of questions about morality , justice , exploitation and society that 'll keep you thinking for much longer that the film 's two and some hours . The direction and performances are amazing - the pre-visualization on this movie must have been a nightmare and yet all the incredible special effects blend perfectly into a visual style that is completely natural and assured , as might be expected from Spielberg and Michael Kahn . There are , of course , numerous references and homages to the work of Stanley Kubrick , which have given a hint of the edge and flair of 'Clockwork Orange ' or '2001 ' . I hope it will continue to be a big influence on Spielberg . Cruise delivers a first class performance as usual , but the discovery of this film is Samantha Morton as Agatha .

173,DSM_Doc4_Minority_Report,"Steven Spielberg sets Minority Report in the near future of 2054 , in which the technology is advanced , but not far-fetched . Cars can drive themselves and ride up elevators , computers come with holograms as a user interface , and stores recognize you from your eyeball scan . As all science fiction fans know , however , the genre is not about technology but about ideas . The big idea for Minority Report is based on a short story by the venerable Philip K. Dick . In this future , there is a `` pre-crime '' unit in the police force , which revolves around three psychics who are able to see violent crimes before they occur . These visions are projected in a flat screen panel and manipulated by detectives with the grace of a symphony conductor . Equipped with futuristic stun guns , jet packs , and search robots , these cops then arrest and intern the criminals before the crimes are committed . We learn all this in the first ten minutes of the movie . After this introduction , the plot really starts when Detective John Anderton ( Tom Cruise ) finds out that the precogs saw him kill someone , someone that he has never met . He finds himself in a race . With the forced recruitment of a precog , Agatha ( Samantha Morton ) , he must clear his name before the predetermined murder . All the while , his old buddies , now helped with a special agent from the FBI ( Colin Farrell ) , are trying to track him down . Spielberg , with Janusz Kaminski , his cinematographer for many films , have crafted a visually stunning movie . The special effects are seamlessly incorporated of the world they created . The muted blues echo the style of black & white film noirs . John Anderton is similar to noir 's morally ambiguous characters -- a good cop with an illegal habit that is forced ( by circumstances and desire ) to betray the very things he loves . But this is not just a special effects or mystery movie . The characters , all well drawn , are supremely acted by the cast . Tom Cruise is a good physical actor and he shows it here . By the way he sits or walks , we can intuit the grief and confusion that 's going through him . Samantha Morton does a good job of portraying a haunted young lady who has seen too much . Colin Farrell skillfully balances the ambitious and professional sides of his character . As always , Max von Sydow authoritatively plays the respected father figure . This is one of my favorite Science Fiction films . I would also recommend the following films .

Pretty hefty statement , I realize , but Minority Report 's a pretty hefty movie , one that plays as an innovative mix of futuristic sci-fi and film-noir . And I 'm a little surprised nobody prior to Steven Spielberg has tried for for a similar formula ( cases have been made for Blade Runner and Dark City , though I ca n't entirely agree ) . Minority Report is set in the year 2054 , a future that , outside of the roads and constant eye-scans , still visually resembles the present ( or the past , in this movie 's case ) . Tom Cruise stars as John Anderton , one of the heads of Pre-Crime , a division in Washington , D.C. that has the ability to stop murders before they happen , thanks to the work of three Pre-Cogs , psychics ( two male and one female ) permanently placed in a watery bath , delivering info about the future to the Pre-Crime division ( just how it 's done is revealed in a very clever and tense opening sequence ) . Anyway , there 's a debate over whether or not Pre-Crime should go national , and it 's something that the people are going to vote on . The creator of this division , Lamar Burgess ( Max Von Sydow ) , is a bit wary of the FBI agent ( Colin Farrell ) sent to investigate the way the division operates and the possible infallibilities . Anderton himself has a bit of a mess in his personal life . He lost his son six years ago , is divorced , and is addicted to illegal drugs . But matters grow even worse when the Pre-Cogs ' latest vision displays a pre-meditated murder ( unsurprisingly stated as a rarity in D.C. ) and the killer happens to be Anderton himself ! Going on the run , Anderton struggles to escape his old teammates and discover the truth behind this vision ; is it a mistake or a genuine view of a nightmarish destiny ? First off , let me say hats off to Steven Spielberg . The man 's always had unfounded criticism tossed at him with virtually every film he 's ever made . It 's nice to see he 's never dissuaded ( or influenced ) by such complaints , he 's a filmmaker who 's always crafted his films with a touch of confidence and genuine emotion that few directors could even hope to achieve in decades worth of work ( in case you ca n't tell , I 'm a Spielberg fan , meaning I 've just incurred the wrath of David Lynch lovers ) .

175,DSM_Doc6_Minority_Report,"Steven Spielberg has made a couple of clunkers in his career , that 's for sure . When sitting through Hook or The Lost World : Jurassic Park II , it 's difficult to believe that the same man who made Jaws or E.T . or Close Encounters had a hand in them . Most of Spielberg 's output , though , has been fantastic . Despite the occasional 1941 , his films , even when flawed , soar above the average film . Minority Report falls into the category of fantastic and soaring , yet deeply flawed . Minority Report is , above all else , an enormously entertaining film . I personally like actioners and thrillers and sci-fi , and Minority Report fits well into all these categories . There are a couple of action set pieces that are simply amazing , like the chase through the car factory or the spider scene . Unfortunately , in the idea department , the film is kind of a dud . Critics have immediately pointed to the politics of today to show how prescient Minority Report is , but no matter how large and powerful the intelligence industry gets I seriously do n't believe that we 'll ever live in a world where , even if it were possible to predict crime , law enforcement could arrest someone for a crime they were about to commit . And then , without a trial , apparently , they not only imprison the pre-perpetrators , but they encase them in suspended animation goo , apparently forever . At least they never say whether these prisoners are ever to be released . I mean , what happened to correctional institutions ! And , what 's worse , almost every perpetrator chooses to murder for reasons of passion since everyone knows that it 's impossible to commit premeditated murder . That means that a man who was about to stab his wife and her lover with a pair of scissors - a horrific but understandable crime - is doomed to never see the light of day again ( apparently ) . And I have n't even mentioned the time frame : this story takes place in just over 50 years from now . It specifically states that the ACLU still exists . Perhaps if the film took place a hundred and fifty years from now and the ACLU had been disbanded or something ( with some heavy explanations in that department ) , I may have bought the story . The screenwriters never come close to making the situation believable . And even if it were n't so unbelievable , the film has dozens of flaws besides that , and several poor , not very well thought out scenes . For example , the crimes are predicted by three psychics whose origins are dubiously explained . Part of the plot of the film is that this Pre-Crime department is supposed to expand nation-wide .",DSM_Doc6_Minority_Report,DSM,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority_Report
176,DSM_Doc7_Minority_Report,"For a work of speculative or science fiction to be credible , it must limit the number of demands it makes upon viewers/readers to suspend disbelief . For example , a top-notch , space-based science fiction story may allow for faster-than-light travel , but it generally has to stick to plausible science after that . If a work is pure fantasy , then it is possible to demand more of viewers/readers , but even it must remain internally consistent to whatever set of rules it creates . Spielberg & Co. attempt to tell a story in which we are asked to accept that law enforcement in the near future has the ability to foresee murders before they actually happen . Fair enough -- we accept this impossible premise in order for the story to unfold , but if the story is to be believable , we should expect no further impositions on our credibility . Other reviewers have commented on various plot problems , which , though valid , are not fundamentally impossible . There is , however , a major plot element involving the ` murder ' that Anderton is supposed to commit that is impossible . SPOILER FOLLOWS : We see the pre-cog vision of the shooting multiple times as we approach the actual confrontation . In this vision , the victim , Leo Crow , has been shot at a distance ( one image ) , and Anderton is seen holding his pistol with arm outstretched , pointing at Crow who is falling away ( second image ) . The second image would be perfectly consistent with someone firing a gun at someone standing a few feet away . However , in the actual event , Anderton does n't deliberately shoot Crow he starts to read him his rights ( a very well done piece of acting by Cruise ) . Crow then begs Anderton to kill him , revealing the planned frame-up . In desperation , Crow rushes forward , grabs Anderton 's gun hand , pulls Anderton and the gun to his chest , and is able to make the gun discharge . We then get a short ( probably less than a second ) repeat of the second pre-cog image , now supposedly real , of Crow falling away with Anderton in exactly the same position , body turned sideways , arm outstretch with the pistol aimed at Crow as though he had just shot him . Impossible ! ! ! This would require that after Crow was shot , Anderton would straighten his arm , turn sideways , and point the pistol at Crow . Aside from there being no time to assume that position , no one having just inadvertently shot someone would behave in such a fashion . It gets worse . A contact pistol wound is very distinct so much so that even the average layperson would be able to distinguish it from a wound made from several feet away",DSM_Doc7_Minority_Report,DSM,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority_Report

It 's because Steven Spielberg has the skill to make a movie that will really knock you on your ass . These days , an intelligent movie is almost certain to get an R rating , because the character of Tom Cruise is a Philip K. Dick character . This guy wrote stories where almost every time , the main character was tripping out in his own head as a different person , experiencing things and discovering things along the way , and so do we along with him . This trick is briefly explored , but in the end it does n't matter anyway , because it was decided this film had to be a PG-13 hero saves the day family entertainment type of film , the demographic that Spielberg has catered to all for almost all of his career . The visual style they are trying to use here , which involves extensive use of a blue filter on the lens , really does n't look pleasing to the eye . In fact , the film is rather ugly to look at , the design is unimaginative . A noir film is filmed at night ! When you film at day , and put a blue lens on your camera to make it dark anyway , it does n't make sense . Has anyone reading this article seen a movie called `` And God Spoke '' ? It 's a fake documentary where two idiot z-level direct to video filmmakers decide to make a film about the bible because `` it 's the biggest best seller of all time , the biggest target audience . '' During the production , they decide to hire a polish cinematographer who is obsessed with Sven Nykvist . He thinks if he films exactly like Sven Nykvist , who is famous for his creative uses of dark lenses in brilliantly lit scenes , he will be like Sven Nykvist . He idolizes the man . When they film the garden of eden sequence , it 's a cheap production , they barely have any lights , but the cameraman has put very dark lenses on the camera to be like Sven Nykvist . The end result is , they ca n't see anything , it 's too murky and dark . He wasted several hundred thousand dollars in re-shoots in overruns . The point is , Minority Report is so boring that 's how I was able to think of this connection . Does n't Spielberg know that history grinds away at hacks ?

And Spielberg has , in recent years , become something of a middle-brow human revival house : he 's made two David Lean movies ( `` Schindler 's List '' and `` Saving Private Ryan '' ) , followed by a Stanley Kubrick movie ( `` A.I . `` ) , without ever really forging his own style or perspective ( while taking breathers with the `` Jurassic Parks '' , which were just family-sweetened `` Jaws '' rehashes ) . In artistic terms , Spielberg 's been running on empty for as long as twenty years ( since his last good-all-the-way-through movie , `` E.T . `` ) , and at some base level , everybody knows he 's leveraged to the hilt - but he can still put together dazzlingly kinetic sequences ( D-Day in `` Ryan '' ; the attack on the Jewish ghetto in `` Schindler '' ) that give the audience something to like . It does n't matter that `` Ryan '' and `` Schindler '' ca n't come close to Lean , or that `` A.I . '' basically rewrote - and botched - Kubrick 's ironic ending . They SEEM like the old kind of popular , yet artistically successful movies ; we can pretend they are , at any rate - and that 's worth something . With Spielberg in serious decline - and Sam Raimi waiting in the wings - the whole boomer 70s Hollywood balloon seems somehow in jeopardy . And so the laurels are thrown for a movie far more muddled than `` A.I . `` , but not nearly as interesting . Spielberg has drenched `` Minority Report '' in a grainy , silvery light , as if we were watching the whole thing reflected on chrome - obviously we 're supposed to be like one of his `` pre-cogs '' , dreaming the future in a silvery secret sauce . The film is based on a Philip K. Dick short story , but Dick would probably do a few revolutions in his grave if he saw it . His amusing , paradoxical idea ( of stopping crime by seeing into the future and preventing murders , but then prosecuting the would-be killers anyway ) has been extended far , far beyond its limited ability to distract us . As he demonstrated in `` Ryan '' , Spielberg seems to believe that he can inflate even slim ironies and paradoxes into two hour-plus meditations . Alas , he ca n't .

The scene is more interesting to describe than it is to watch . Cruise 's sperm-ship enters through an airlock that resembles a geometrized vulva . He arrives inside a massive chamber lined with egg-like glass bubbles . At the center of the chamber is a pulsating , sentient triangle that is also supposed to be some kind of mother figure . Cruise must destroy the mother triangle and her space uterus in order to save the Earth . Like director Joseph Kosinski 's debut , `` Tron : Legacy '' ( 2010 ) , `` Oblivion '' is a special effects extravaganza with a lot of blatant symbolism and very little meaning . It starts slow , turns dull and then becomes tedious which makes it a marginal improvement over the earlier film . It features shiny surfaces , clicky machinery and no recognizable human behavior . It 's equally ambitious and gormless . `` Oblivion '' is set in the year 2077 , 60 years after an alien invasion rendered the Earth largely uninhabitable . Cruise stars as Jack Harper , one of a handful of people left on the planet . The other survivors have long since relocated to Titan . Harper and colleagues remain as technicians , servicing robot drones that defend resource-gathering stations from alien stragglers . Harper lives in a penthouse-like tower with his communications officer , Vica ( Andrea Riseborough ) . Vica 's eyes are permanently dilated . Like Olivia Wilde 's Quorra in `` Tron : Legacy , '' she often resembles a marionette .

One day , Harper spots an antique spacecraft crashing into the countryside . He manages to rescue one survivor , a Russian astronaut ( Olga Kurylenko ) who looks exactly like the woman in his dreams . Harper brings her back to his tower . This incites jealousy and suspicion from Vica , who is both Harper 's partner and his lover . The astronaut has been in cryogenic sleep for the past six decades but refuses to disclose the nature of her mission to Harper and Vica until they recover her flight recorder .

The agony of being a longtime Tom Cruise fan has always been a burden , but now its just , well , dispiriting . You not only have to ignore the din of the tabloids and swat away the buzzing generated by his multiple headline-ready dramas , you also have to come to grips with the harsh truth that it no longer actually matters why and how Tom Terrific became less so . No one else much cares . Mr. Cruise hasnt made it easy . His screen presence has continued to grow ever-more self-serious , despite occasional attempts to lighten up , as in the recent would-be satire Rock of Ages . Midway through Oblivion I wondered when I had last believed there was something true in his laugh , something that felt either genuinely expansive or intimate , as in Jerry Maguire , or chilled with a hint of madness , as in Magnolia . Mind you , he doesnt have many occasions to laugh in Oblivion , a gray post-apocalyptic tale with rainbow accents , yet when he does , it feels uncomfortably forced . In those moments , was he worrying that the movie wasnt going to return him to the box office summit ? Hes 50 years old and too young to be prepping for a slow fade , yet what are his choices ? Working with better directors with filmmakers who know how to charm or force performances out of stars or perhaps say no to them seems like a good place to start . Oblivion is only the second feature directed by Joseph Kosinski , after the 2010 release Tron : Legacy . That special effects-laden fantasy , a musty heros journey largely distinguished by the yawning divide between its poor quality and its $ 170 million price tag , was a flat line of a dud in almost every respect . It nonetheless made enough money to shore up an exploitable franchise property and spawn a sequel , and while this may not sound like much of an achievement , box office success or the perception of it can beget more opportunities in the movie business , which may help explain Oblivion . Its story primarily unfolds in 2077 , long after a cataclysmic war between earthlings and extraterrestrials . Nuked to all but radioactive ash , the Earth has been rendered nearly uninhabitable , and its remaining people have fled to a galactic shelter . The only ones left on the planet appear to be Jack Harper ( Mr. Cruise ) and his companion , Victoria ( Andrea Riseborough ) , who live in a cantilevered aerie above the clouds that brings",AVR_Doc2_Oblivion,AVR,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion

Pitting the latest action-hero incarnation of Tom Cruise against an army of alien marauders , director Joseph Kosinskis follow-up to Tron : Legacy is a moderately clever dystopian mindbender with a gratifying human pulse , despite some questionable narrative developments along the way . The less-than-airtight construction and conventional resolution may rankle genre devotees , though hardly to the detriment of robust overall B.O . Getting the blockbuster season off to an early start on April 19 , when it opens Stateside in wide release and in Imax theaters , Oblivion reps the latest test of Cruises bankability , coming mere months after he tried on a new ass-kicking persona with Jack Reacher . This time hes Jack Harper , and without giving too much away , theres an amusing , perhaps unintended existential subtext here about the somewhat interchangeable men of action Cruise has played over the course of his career . Still , the actors first foray into science fiction in eight years ( if you dont count Rock of Ages ) comes with a more intriguing backstory than most . Its the year 2077 , six decades after the people of Earth fought and vanquished an evil race of space invaders called Scavengers . But victory has come at a great cost . The planet is now an uninhabitable post-nuclear wasteland , and Jack ( Cruise ) is one of the last men still stationed on Earth , a fighter pilot/technician assigned to fend off stray Scavengers and repair the powerful drones overseeing a massive hydroelectric energy project necessary for the survival of the human species . It all looks and sounds a bit like a live-action remake of Wall-E , right down to the way the protagonist , spurred by natural curiosity and an unexpected love interest , finds himself on a dangerous unauthorized mission . Until now , Jack has worked effectively enough with Vika ( Andrea Riseborough ) , who guides his repair jobs with cool , formidable efficiency from the glassy confines of their high-tech home base ( referred to as the Skytower , though it might as well be called the iPad ) . But unlike his partner , Jack is a dreamer and a bit of a poet , someone who cant help reminiscing about the past or questioning everyones future . Haunted by pre-apocalyptic visions of a beautiful mystery woman ( Olga Kurylenko ) , he cant quite grasp why humanity , having won the war , has decided to permanently abandon its native planet for an uncertain future in space .

Sadly there 's none of Wall-E 's spark in this bafflingly solemn , lugubrious and fantastically derivative sci-fi which serves up great big undigested lumps of Total Recall , AI , Planet of the Apes with little snippets of Top Gun . Cruise plays Jack Harper , a tough and self-reliant soldier in the late 21st century , after a victorious but catastrophically destructive battle against alien invaders . He has been tasked along with the sleek and adoring Victoria , played by Andrea Riseborough to monitor what remains of Earth prior to humanity 's final emigration , and to supervise a fleet of pilotless drone craft which hunt down hostile `` scavs '' , or scavengers , hiding out on the surface . His immediate memory has been wiped in order to prevent hostile forces getting intel from him , in case of capture , but his orders are clear in what remains of his mind . The human race is to evacuate the planet ( having farmed what hydroelectric energy it can from the oceans ) and then decamp to one of Saturn 's moons of all the unattractive places . But Jack is plagued with weird mental images of a romantic encounter in pre-war New York and when he finds a beautiful human survivor , Julia ( Olga Kurylenko ) , she stirs intense memories , and it is clear that there is something the authorities are not telling him . Peter Bradshaw , Henry Barnes and Catherine Shoard review Oblivion guardian.co.uk This movie has some beautiful images of planetary ruin and huge tracts of desert and forest with the topmost bits of famous buildings poking up . There is not much actual rubbish and detritus around of the sort that Wall-E had to deal with , incidentally : an accelerated natural growth of trees and foliage has evidently covered up all that unsightly stuff , and everything is made all the more spectacular on an Imax screen . There are futurist aircraft whooshing through the mist , or being accepted into the bosoms of colossally large mother-ships out in space , like the photorealist cover-designs of a classic SF novel . But the story itself feels numbed , directionless and dull ; Morgan Freeman is entirely wasted in a sketchily conceived supporting role and director and co-writer Joseph Kosinski allows Tom Cruise to play to his weaknesses . There is little of the knowing humour and fun we saw in the Mission Impossible films , just plenty of shots of Tom doing his Action Hero face , at the controls of his elaborate helicopter-plane-device , or dropping athletically down on ropes , or on the macho motorbike he occasionally rides",AVR_Doc4_Oblivion,AVR,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion
184,AVR_Doc5_Oblivion,"In December , Tom Cruise starred as the title character in the film `` Jack Reacher . '' In `` Oblivion , '' which opened on Friday , he plays another Jack , one of few humans left on an Earth devastated by an alien invasion . `` Oblivion '' is based on a graphic novel co-written by Joseph Kosinski , who went on to direct the film , and it costars Morgan Freeman and Melissa Leo . Film critic David Edelstein has this review . DAVID EDELSTEIN , BYLINE : As I suffered through the Tom Cruise vehicle `` Oblivion '' I wondered if Cruise was trying to beat out fellow Scientologist John Travolta for the worst plotted sci-fi movie ever . Thank heavens , he lost . Nothing will ever be as shatteringly inane as Travolta 's L. Ron Hubbard movie `` Battlefield Earth . '' But making a film with Joseph Kosinski - director of `` Tron : Legacy '' - is like taking a multiple choice survey that says : I want my space movies more , A , incoherent , B , plotting ; or , C , migraine-inducing and checking E , all of the above . Yet `` Oblivion 's '' early scenes do exert a strange fascination . They 're so conscientiously neutral , so droningly dull , that they almost pass for Stanley Kubrick ( technical difficulties ) big . Big , white impersonal settings on a big barren landscape under a big fractured moon , for one big segment broken off and simply hanging , suspended , or ( technical difficulties ) . Cruise 's character , Jack , explains in voiceover that that 's how aliens , called Scavengers , obliterated humankind . They blew up the moon and nature did the rest . We beat the invaders back , he goes on , and took off en masse to colonize a moon of Saturn , Titan . But a few people stayed behind to take what resources they could and watch out for leftover bands of Scavs . Jack and his lovely Victoria , played by Andrea Riseborough , are a team . She sits in a giant mushroom-like flight tower with readouts from hydro rigs while Jack flies around repairing equipment and summing lethal drones whenever he finds signs of alien saboteurs . The first half-hour is Jack narrating , Jack talking to Victoria on his headset , and Jack zooming around . Victoria talks to an administrator on a screen called Sally , played by Melissa Leo . Jack and Victoria talk about their imminent departure for Titan and have sex . It 's amazing how fast the novelty of all those nifty sets wears off . Everything , including the actors , looks computer generated , 100 percent inauthentic . But , ah , is that the point ? Is anything what it seems ? Jack feels dislocated .

185,AVR_Doc6_Oblivion,"`` Oblivion '' looks marvelous , in the deliciously dystopian way of so many post-apocalyptic films . It 's set in 2077 , after alien invaders called Scavengers ( or `` Scavs '' ) have laid waste to our moon , leading to cataclysmic floods and earthquakes that have ravaged Earth . The film features gorgeous CGI shots of such broken , half-buried landmarks as the Washington Monument and the Empire State Building , whose observation deck can now be accessed by walking onto it from a mountain of rubble . It 's the kind of film that 's perfect for the Imax format in which some theaters are offering it . Just be warned that this means its also very , very loud . One joker at a preview screening shouted , Volume ! as the film was barely getting under way , to much laughter . He wasnt complaining that it was too quiet . It ought to look good . The movie , by director Joseph Kosinski ( `` Tron : Legacy '' ) , is said to be based on a graphic novel by Kosinski and comic book writer Arvid Nelson . Although that book was never published and probably never will be the mock-up of the story drew the attention of star Tom Cruise , along with not one , but two , studios . Disney , which originally had the rights , ultimately gave them up to Universal , which made the film . Its an engrossing , if complicated and twisty , story , with plentiful sci-fi action and a provocative subtext about the nature of the human soul . At times , however , the balance between those two things feels off . Some of the fight sequences , which involve robotic flying drones mounted with guns , go on a bit longer than is strictly necessary . Cruise plays Jack Harper , a futuristic maintenance man whose dangerous job consists of repairing the drones that patrol Earth , an unpopulated wasteland where giant hydro rigs convert seawater into energy to be used by whats left of the human race , which has relocated to a colony on one of Saturns moons . Although weve won the war against the Scavs , there are still some left , and they like to sabotage the hydro rigs and the drones almost as much as they enjoy trying to kill Jack . He and his partner/lover , Victoria ( Andrea Riseborough ) , who provides backup from a command center in the clouds , have their work cut out for them , but its more routine than glamorous . Were the mop-up crew , Jack says . All is not as it appears , however . That scenario , as laid out by Jack in voice-over narration , soon starts to show cracks .

186,AVR_Doc7_Oblivion,"A sort of The Eternal Return played out in the ruins of a post-apocalyptic planet Earth , Joseph Kosinskis Oblivion is an absolutely gorgeous film dramatically caught between its aspirations for poetic romanticism and the demands of heavy sci-fi action . After a captivating beginning brimming with mystery and evident ambition , the air gradually seeps out of the balloon that keeps this thinly populated tale aloft , leaving the ultimate impression of a nice try that falls somewhat short of the mark . Theres enough futuristic eye candy and battle scenes to lure the genre boys , while the presence of three important female characters , as well as Tom Cruise in good form , could attract more women than usual for this sort of fare , resulting in mostly robust , but not great , returns worldwide . The Universal release opens this week in most international territories , while the domestic bow comes April 19 . To those who might wish to avoid a film by the maker of Tron : Legacy , it should be stressed that Oblivion is a more interesting work by a good distance , an imaginative speculative piece set some six decades hence that always engages serious attention , even if it doesnt convincingly jell . In mood , a certain delicacy and the sense of isolation both on a depopulated Earth and somewhere above it , the recent film that this most strongly recalls is WALL-E , except with violence and without the humor and charm of the Pixar classic . The Bottom Line A terrific-looking sci-fier that loses steam in the second half . There have been many films set on an Earth depleted of humans , but few as visually enthralling as this one . Shot by Claudio Miranda of Life of Pi , Oblivion shares that films lovely light , nuanced coloration and virtually seamless meshing of live photography and effects . In neither film is it always possible to be entirely sure of what is real and whats computer generated , but the result is beautiful however it breaks down . After what appear to be memory flashes of a previous life back in an early 21st century New York City on the part of Cruises Jack Harper , he and his partner Vika ( Andrea Riseborough ) wake up in what can only take the prize as the ultimate loft space , circa 2077 , a perch thats the last word in minimalist chic . It also affords unobstructed views of whats been left behind after the catastrophe that saw the moon blown into pieces , which in turn resulted in earthly ruin and a subsequent evacuation of survivors to Saturns planet Titan . Jack ( Cruises second use of the name in a row , after Jack Reacher ) takes daily spins down to Earth in a bladeless , mosquito-like helicopter , while the British Vika tracks his movements and coordinates with headquarters , personified",AVR_Doc7_Oblivion,AVR,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion
187,AVR_Doc8_Oblivion,"Oblivion will make you remember , not forget . This Tom Cruise vehicle is a throwback to the days when on-screen science fiction was about speculative ideas rather than selling toys to tots think of it as the most expensive episode of The Twilight Zone ever made . Oblivion is not perfect . Its dystopian story makes no apologies for its familiarity , echoing such films as The Planet of the Apes , The Matrix , 2001 and even Wall-E. And expecting the wheels not to eventually begin to fall off its pleasantly complicated , head-spinning plot ( based on the director Joseph Kosinskis graphic novel ) is asking a little too much . But even given all this implausibility , Oblivion has the ability to haunt you visually and , with an unanticipated love story , even emotionally . Written by Karl Gajdusek and Michael DeBruyn , this is a piece of futuristic fiction intended for adults , not their children , a film in which firefights and futuristic weapons feel more like afterthoughts than reasons for being . Given that the film is set on an Earth 60-plus years in the future , a time after an invasion by rapacious aliens ( are there any other kind ? ) has completely devastated the planet , were expecting to see ruins aplenty , and Oblivion does not disappoint . Overseen by production designer Darren Gilford and shot by Claudio Miranda , whose Life of Pi experience blending physical components and computer-generated effects stood him in good stead , Oblivions snapshots of CGI devastation are enhanced by being shown against real Icelandic landscapes . Whether it be beached warships , the Washington Monument looking like that tower in Pisa or an elaborate re-creation of the wrecked main reading room in the New York Public Librarys Fifth Avenue branch , these images linger in the memory after theyve faded from the screen . Director Kosinski ( Tron : Legacy ) has an architecture background and it shows in the sleekly futuristic look the film gives to both the highly mobile Bubble ship , a combination jet plane and helicopter that looks like a flying can opener , and the Skytower , a coolly minimalistic residential structure set 3,000 feet above the surface of the earth . As important as Oblivions look is its good fortune in having Cruise in the starring role of Jack Harper . The actor is essential in bringing conviction and credibility to this made-up world , and he also expertly handles the huge chunk of voice-over exposition that gets us up to speed in a complicated story . Oblivion starts not with the future but with a black and white dream of Harpers Earth before the war , New York before I was born .

188,AVR_Doc9_Oblivion,"The picture is of course a vehicle for Tom Cruise , and he 's quite good here per-usual . There are only a handful of prominent speaking roles and the film refreshingly takes its time establishing its world before getting to the plot . And yes , the opening reel or so truly does feel like a live-action version of Wall-E , with Cruise flying around the deserted planet fixing stuff and pining for our lost home ( long story short , Earth got invaded and we nuked the Earth in order to repel the invasion ) . The futuristic ships and gadgets are themselves a visual delight , with glorious shots of Cruise piloting his ship literally over the clouds . Despite the film 's $ 120 million budget ( it looks like it cost far more , and I say that as a compliment ) and various futuristic special effects , it 's most special effect is its use of practical locations . It is frankly a different kind of post-apocalyptic film in that it almost revels in the idea of an Earth uncontaminated by humans ( and mostly void of animals to boot ) . Its soaring vistas and epic natural terrains bring to mind something akin to Alan Weisman 's The World Without Us . If it needs to be said , if you 're going to see Oblivion , see Oblivion in IMAX at all costs . On a narrative level , the picture is refreshingly patient , slowly peeling back the curtain to reveal its grand designs , with neither the need to rush into action or spoil all of its major story beats at one time . This is the kind of screenplay I always appreciate , one where story is still being told right up to the end . Detailing the picture 's thematic text would count as a spoiler , so I 'll merely say that the film plays around with classic science fiction concepts without over-stuffing itself with implied deeper meaning . Truth be told , I appreciated the comparative lack of ambition . Oblivion is n't trying to set up a franchise that will spawn sequels and spin-offs in various mediums . In fact , it 's refreshingly close-ended , telling a full story that actually ends at the end . Oblivion is n't trying to be the biggest would-be blockbuster of the year ( it is sparse with its action ) , it merely wants to tell a simple character journey set in the most gorgeous post-apocalyptic wasteland you 've ever seen . Kosinski , with the help of cinematographer Claudio Miranda , seems desperate to prove that Tron : Legacy was n't entirely his fault , showing restraint and moderation where the prior film emphasized lights and smoke to hide its inherent hollowness .

But so far , they 're rather less enamored of `` Oblivion , '' Joseph Kosinski 's tribute to 1970s and '80s science-fiction films .

I 'm sorry , people , but I just have to bring up that with all of these nifty daggers , glowing eyes and desert planet-set sci-fi shenanigans , this is pretty much `` Dune '' , though the reason why people do n't address the similarities between this and said Frank Herbert classic is because they should go without saying , seeing as how this film is taking from most other sci-fi films of its type . Of course , something that it did do that was new was get Vin Diesel recognition in a non-dramatic action film , but even now , that 's a cliche , which is a shame , because the guy has some talent , which is n't to say that one of his skills is making for quite the action star , as this film will tell you . At least he hit the superficial commercial flick scene reasonably well , as this film is pretty decent , and yet , it 's still not without its share of problems . I 'd imagine plenty of people are expecting subtlety lapses in this film , and sure enough , while the film is not as bombastic as you might fear , it has its share of jumps scares and overemphasized imagery , as well as overstylized moments that would be more justified if it was n't for such technical issues as somewhat underwhelming production designs , questionable effects and occasionally frantic editing . These subtlety issues and technical limitations plague the film with something of an amateur feel that dilute the final product 's intellectual value , - the potential for which is greater than you might think in this character study thriller - which a potential for depth goes watered down by some undercooking to characterization .

Although it 's the splashiest cutting-edge effects picture since `` The Matrix , '' it lacks that work 's epic , synthetic sweep .

However , I find Pitch Black a very cool and fun film that I have watched many times over . The mark of a truly good film is how many times you can watch it . Films like the Departed are good , but I would not re-watch them again . Pitch Black is a decent film and also a very entertaining movie . It has good characters especially the main character Riddick ( Vin Diesel ) . The story is simple but effective . The effects are great as well especially considering when this was made . The story is as follows . A transport ship is transporting a small group of people including a notorious criminal named Riddick to a space outpost called New Mecca .

We know he is a notorious criminal but we do not know anything else about him including what he did that made him a criminal . He also has somewhat of a superpower . He had these special eyes which allow him to see in the dark . We get more information about Riddick in the sequel to this film . Normally not knowing much about a character is a negative but in this case it makes him more fascinating . He is one of the big reasons why I love this film . The other characters are good , but without Riddick the film would not be as memorable . The other characters are decent as well . You have Fry ( Radha Mitchell ) who is a junior pilot on the ship . She is the one character who goes through a character arc in this film . At the beginning she tries to kill the rest of the passengers to ensure that they survive the crash . Throughout the film she tries to make amends for that . You also have Johns ( Cole Hauser ) who is a police officer in charge of bringing Riddick in . He is kind of the semi-villain of the series .

These guys you do n't really care about them , but they serve a purpose to the plot . The second category is the likeable , but not super developed characters . These people get a decent amount of screen time , some memorable moments and whether or not they make it out alive , well you really do n't know . Included in this category are Rhiana Griffith as Jack , Keith David as Imam and Lewis Fitz-Geral as Paris . Each of these characters spends enough time on the screen for you to start to really care about whether or not they are going to make it and fulfill different roles in the story .

Normallly I do n't like watching any movies where people are in imminent danger of dying whether from natural disasters , alien monsters or crazed lunatics because more often than not I believe the hapless characters SHOULD die for the blunders that get them killed . All this made me wonder what on earth possesed me to watch this in the first place when it first came out and I remembered that it was a recommendation from a friend on the merits of the characters in the movie , specifically Riddick . This of course got me curious and the rest as they say is history . Seriously , David Thowy and Co. probably were n't setting out to make a stirring character study and in-depth analysis of the levels of monstrosity that exist in regular human beings but to me this is what makes Pitch Black , as opposed to Chronicles of Riddick , such an excellent movie . The characters were all , as far as we knew , nothing more than human . What some of them did and/or wanted to do however , made the movie interesting . Essentially , everyone here was fighting for survival . It was great to see how far down their moral scale , if they had a moral scale at all , they were willing to go to do so . Maybe I 'm reading too much into this . Maybe they planned it . Maybe it was all accidental . Whatever the reason , the characters , Richard B. Riddick in particular , were what made this movie the little gem it was when it should n't have been more than B-grade schlock . Unfortunately they decided to take the franchise ( once they figured out they could build a franchise on Riddick 's back ) towards E.T . sci-fi and away from human interactions since that was the most interesting part of it to me . All in all , an interesting enough film about danger from monsters in an alien planet . The question becomes ... which are the more dangerous monsters ? Entertainment Value - 1 and 1/2 Stars : I actually really enjoyed watching this movie . It was worth the time . Storytelling - 1/2 Star : The story was a very thin sci-fi horror staple but , once you suspended the requisite parts of belief for the genre , the sequence of events , while outlandish and extremely unlucky , was plausible . Characters and Dialogue - 1 Star : This made the movie . Every character was true to",MKW_Doc5_Pitch_Black,MKW,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pitch_Black
195,MKW_Doc6_Pitch_Black,"If you ever wondered what it might feel like to be inside a spaceship cracking apart during a violent crash landing , Pitch Black gives you the experience bright and early . The camera jiggles around spasmodically , the actors shout unintelligible gibberish at each other , the sound hammers us . Unfortunately , this describes too much of the rest of the movie , too , without a crash landing as an excuse . Pitch Black is yet another insecure hissy fit of a movie a thriller without enough confidence in itself or its characters to calm down for two seconds and let the actors speak to each other like human beings . Movies like this copy the who-goes-there thrills of Alien and John Carpenter 's The Thing without those films ' grubby , everyday , human-scaled group dynamics . Here , the spaceship in question is carrying a motley crew mostly headed for someplace called `` New Mecca '' ; in addition to the expected Muslims ( led by Keith David , of The Thing ) , there 's a geologist , an antiques collector , a morphine-addicted cop , a teenage boy who 's not what he seems , and a serial killer . This all smacks of gimmickry these are n't people , they 're conflict units . In Alien and The Thing , the people confined together were allowed personalities which could then flare up . The only people in Pitch Black with anything resembling a personality are the serial killer , Riddick ( Vin Diesel ) , and the ship 's pilot , Fry ( Radha Mitchell ) , whose soft features juxtapose nicely with her tough nature . Mostly , the people wander around on the parched , godforsaken rock they 've landed on , squabbling over how to escape , while gradually being picked off by slithering monsters who thrive on darkness . Of course , this planet has three suns and thus no darkness , but would n't you just know a total eclipse happens to be approaching ? Pitch Black does have an imaginative look . Whenever the characters step outside into the alien air , cinematographer David Eggby ( Mad Max ) bleaches out everything , which makes sense : These are alien suns whose light is passing through an alien atmosphere , so of course things will look different . And I liked how Riddick , whose eyes have been doctored to allow him to see in the dark , emerges as the unlikely hero who alone can see the ravenous monsters . The Riddick's-eye view of the beasts is a neat touch of psychedelia . Problem is , you may wish you could see through Riddick 's eyes all the time . Pitch Black , like so many other horror movies in recent years , is too often so dimly lit that you ca n't tell what 's going on . Yes , the latter half unfolds",MKW_Doc6_Pitch_Black,MKW,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch_Black
196,MKW_Doc7_Pitch_Black,"Pitch Black is action science-fiction that barely qualifies as action and not at all as either science or fiction . Vin Diesel ( Saving Private Ryan , Boiler Room ) , who is waiting for something better to come along , and Radha Mitchell ( High Art ) , who barely pretends an interest , star as the two leaders of a crew of space travellers marooned on a sinister planet . Mitchell , the co-pilot of the crashed craft , had considered jettisoning the passenger compartment with its dozen or so paying travellers until stopped from doing so by her co-pilot ( Cole Hauser ) . Of course , this revelation comes to light , but even that opportunity for narrative progression fails to enliven the main thread of this yarn , the millionth knock-off of the Aliens films to misunderstand completely what makes those films such extraordinary entertainments . Ripley , Ash , Bishop , Newt , and all the other participants in those narrativeswell , perhaps less in the case of the latter two filmscomprised fascinating human communities , who each had their own views of each other and , therefore , their own plans for battling the alien ( s ) , even their own notions of what the aliens were . Pitch Black , following its title , is totally in the dark about character development . It constitutes a significant ( and much-praised ! ) arc in this picture for Diesel , a technologically-augmented killing machine , to help fight the good fight with the rest of the castaways when they begin , obligatorily , to be assaulted by flying , carnivorous outer-space nasties . That 's the best description I can give of the beasts , who look a little like hammerhead shark-pelican hybrids as designed by H.R . Giger . What the desperate strandees soon discover is that the creatures can only move ( nay , survive ) in darkness , so all movement must be done either by day or in the presence of bright electric lamps , flares , lightning bugs in a jar . . . Anything in this paragraph that sounds like a joke is not , and that extends to the imperialist plunderer trying to save his excavated bottles and trinkets , nor to the very spiritual black man whose presence all but negates the other character 's implicit poke in the ribs at colonialist stereotypes . We also have on board a transgendered person whose obviously female anatomy made the `` surprise '' gender-bender on the flunked WB dramedy Young Americans seem like a Hitchcockian coup de revelation , and whose presence ( not to mention his exposure ) advances the narrative not one iota . Given the low-fi cast and the crude nature of the effects , Pitch Black ca n't possibly have cost much to make , and yet I still ca n't believe what could have been done in the world with the",MKW_Doc7_Pitch_Black,MKW,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch_Black
197,MKW_Doc8_Pitch_Black,"This sci-fi horror flick is at its best simulating a hypothetical three sun solar system . Amateur astronomers ( myself one ) will raise many a deliberating eyebrow at the assumptions we swallow in order to accept this conjectural reality . The film opens with a space vessel transporting a load of commercial passengers ( average people , save for the hardened criminal ) all enjoying dreams in cryo-sleep ( save for the hardened criminal ) . Suddenly , unknown objects rip through the walls of the vessel awakening all while killing the captain ( of course ) . Now if this is bad luck , just wait ... `` Pitch Black '' defines the meaning of the phrase . The first mate , a sassy blonde , jumps to the pilot seat in time to see the surface of some planet swiftly approaching . In an effort to gain control of the speeding ship she quickly purges large sections of it ... including the payload ( the passengers ) ; but something 's wrong , the lever sticks and she 's forced to land with all on board . This sequence displays perhaps the most exhilarating graphics of the film . Atmospheric debris shatter the windshield into a splash of dust ( miraculously , the pilot 's pretty face is n't in the slightest marred ) . But still the menacing rush of dust and wind create a thrilling ride for the audience as the ship slides across the burnt orange surface of an unknown land . You 'll sigh in relief when it finally comes to a stop . Looking out on the horizon , survivors quickly conclude that there will be no nightfall due to the multiple suns . Which is a good thing , because the planet is inhabited by `` a lot '' of nasty pterodactyl type aliens that do n't like the light . But do n't forget the bad luck factor ; though the place is devoid of anything else , our travelers quickly stumble across an old mining factory , pick up one sample , instantly evaluate it as the last one , decode its age at 22 years ( in unknown planet time , that is ) , then run over to a rather cool mechanical replica of the current solar system left by the human minors mysteriously killed 22 years back . The sharp unmarred pilot hand-revolves the geared planetary assemblage 22 times back into the solar system 's history . The convenient counter clicks backward . Ah-oh , an eclipse ! What are the chances of that ? These poor kids just happened to be marooned on a planet inhabited by light-hating beasts on the very day of its 22-year cycle eclipse . With an hour 's warning , the quickly dwindling troop still is n't prepared as the huge second planet with parallel rings rotating in opposite directions ( not sure that 's possible ) rather swiftly blots",MKW_Doc8_Pitch_Black,MKW,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch_Black
198,MKW_Doc9_Pitch_Black,"When a spaceship crash-lands on a planet of three suns that is plagued by darkness as a solar eclipse hits , the survivors must fight the nocturnal batlike alien creatures . These aliens avoid the light and strike when it 's dark . The survivors include a dangerous murderer serving a life sentence in maximum security , Riddick ( Diesel ) , who has surgically implanted eyes that shine enabling him to have night vision . He also has awesome muscles that are pumped for action . He wore specially fitted contact lenses to give him that shine job look . The survivors include : Riddick , who is in chains as he is being transported to another prison ; the cruel guard , Johns ( Cole Hauser ) , who it turns out has a few flaws in his personality which include a morphine habit ; and , the spacecraft 's landing pilot , Fry ( Radha Mitchell ) , who becomes the captain when it 's discovered that the captain 's throat had been slashed . These two leaders of the plan to get off the dark planet , Johns and Fry , argue all the time , and trust among the survivors becomes the issue . Fry had her moment of cowardice when landing the plane , as she almost panicked and pulled the cord to eject the passengers . This is something Johns uses against her . The other survivors include : a preachy Muslim imam , a holy man , talking up a storm about God ; a prissy English antiquities dealer whose wine collection is used as lighting fuel to get them off this darkened wasteland . And a boy called Jack who turns out to be a girl named Jackie , as discovered through the efforts of Riddick 's nose for sniffing out female hormones . This sci-fi formula action flick is noteworthy for its splendid cinematography , as it was filmed in the Australian Outback , and also for its innovative editing cuts . The story line left me gasping for more light and the acting left me in the dark searching for one line of dialogue that was n't shrill or trite . No actor was provided with a challenging part , but Diesel uses his powerfully muscular presence and deep baritone voice to dominate his scenes . He comes to say one-liners such as : `` They did not know who they were f * cking with ! '' He says this to the dead aliens after he puts them out of their misery , but he might as well have spoken it to a sleeping audience . The writer/director David Twohy ( The Arrival ) tries to bring some intelligence to the story , but the script is too shallow and predictable . The characters ranged from a shrill Radha to a cartoonlike Diesel . It is easy to root for the aliens to possibly , against all odds",MKW_Doc9_Pitch_Black,MKW,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch_Black
199,MKW_Doc10_Pitch_Black,"`` Pitch Black '' is the first movie I 've seen that tries to mix elements of a slasher film and an `` Alien '' sequel to get its thrills . It may also be the first film to arrive at the conclusion that , if a planet has three suns in its scope , they can all have simultaneous eclipses every 20 years or so . That certainly does n't seem like a big deal , but for the characters who discover nocturnal aliens who feed on human flesh , the event is anything but welcomed with anticipation . In a landscape of brightly pale colors and peculiar ancient ruins , survivors of a crashed space vessel must come together and set aside their past differences for survival ; once the suns have moved behind a planet circled in rings , the shrieks of alien beings and the crunch of eaten bones will be the only sounds they hear . The movie is a result of peculiar intentions ; director David N. Twohy builds up incredible tension during the first hour , only to completely extinguish it by having his characters roam around in the dark like victims of a horror movie . It is a picture that wants to combine formulas for its own benefit , but loses the nerve and abandons all hope once it becomes too dark to see anything clearly . To say the movie could have been great is most accurate ; unfortunately , neither the characters nor the story have anywhere to go once the nightfall has settled in . Kudos to the script for trying anyhow ( which is something more than I could say for `` Supernova '' ) . Our story opens up in an undisclosed location deep in space , where a space craft carrying several individuals begins experience turbulence as it speeds through a stream of asteroids . One of the vessel attendants , the fetchingly strong-willed Fry ( Radha Mitchell ) , tries to subvert the problems at the main control panel , but the ship enters the atmosphere of a hot planet and crash-lands in the dirt at the cost of a captain and many important supplies . The ship is torn completely apart -- even one of the onboard individuals , a killer named Riddick who has been placed under maximum security watch , turns up missing . Seeking out water , and hopefully shelter , the survivors of the ship begin a trek across a wide-open desert that features desolate cemeteries , underground tunnels and three different suns keeping the planet 's atmosphere lit up like Las Vegas . Meanwhile , the killer Riddick ( Vin Diesel ) remains missing ; without a dead body , the survivors presume he is hiding somewhere nearby . During their journey , they hope to find some form of life that can help in their journey off of the quiet planet ; what they find instead is",MKW_Doc10_Pitch_Black,MKW,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch_Black
