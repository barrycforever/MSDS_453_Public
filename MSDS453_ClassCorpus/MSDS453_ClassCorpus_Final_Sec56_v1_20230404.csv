101,SCO_Doc1_DespicableMe3,SCO_Doc1_DespicableMe3,SCO,Comedy,Positive,Despicable Me 3,"Repeating a formula that worked like gangbusters in the last installment, which became the most profitable film in Universal history, Despicable Me 3 offers up more of the same: more Gru - actually Gru times two if you count his twin brother, Dru; more Minions (though thankfully less than in their own exhausting 2015 spinoff); more Looney Tunes-esque sight gags; more pop-culture references, with an emphasis on the 1980s this time; and more catchy Pharrell Williams songs on the soundtrack. It's an if-it-ain't-broke-then-don't-fix-it approach that works just fine if you're simply looking to take another ride on the rollercoaster, with Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig returning to voice a pair of lovey-dovey superspy parents out to rid the world of evil yet again. Indeed, the original film's enticing premise, about a bad guy who can't help turning good, has been somewhat forgotten, even if series creator Pierre Coffin (working here with Kyle Balda and co-director Eric Guillon) tries to insert a bit of pathos and family matters into the action. Otherwise, this rather clever, breakneck-paced cartoon gives fans exactly what they want: Like the new nemesis voiced by Trey Parker, it shoots multiple machine-gun bursts of bubblegum at the audience, asking them to chew and enjoy. Expect them to do so when the film hits theaters June 30. Wahen we last left Gru (Carell) and Lucy (Wiig), they had forged a happy home with the three girls (Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, Nev Scharrel) the big bad softee wound up with in the first movie. When this one starts, their livelihood is quickly threatened when their Anti-Villain League's new boss (Jenny Slate) fires the couple after they fail to apprehend an arch villain named Balthazar Bratt (Parker) - a former '80s child TV star who has gone all Diff'rent Strokes and turned to a life of crime. The opening reel offers up a slew of Tex Avery-style stunts, music cues ranging from Michael Jackson to Van Halen to A-ha, and enough of the Minions to keep the kids happy. There's a lot thrown at the screen at once, yet Carell and Wiig manage to anchor the action with characters that can seem both outlandish and emotionally real, trying to keep their couple afloat amid the chaos that surrounds them. Coffin and his fellow directors - working with returning scribes Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio - keep several balls in the air at once, kicking off the second act by introducing Dru (Carell again, though with a less pronounced Slavic accent), a long-lost twin brother who seems to be everything Gru isn't, all the way down to a swath of blond hair that Donald Trump could only dream of implanting. But things are not necessarily what they seem, and the brotherly love turns into something else as we learn more about Gru's family history, including a brief cameo from his mother (Julie Andrews), who looks like she's caught in a pool scene from a softcore Italian porno. There are plenty of other"
102,SCO_Doc2_DespicableMe3,SCO_Doc2_DespicableMe3,SCO,Comedy,Positive,Despicable Me 3,"Despicable Me 3 is gleefully anarchic fun, a film that startles us again and again with its offbeat and surrealistic humour. Many of the nostalgic and self-reflexive references here will surely be completely lost on younger viewers but they should delight their parents. The film's villain is embittered former child star Balthazar Bratt (voiced by Trey Parker). Back in 1985, Bratt had his own TV show but then he grew up, got pimples and the show was cancelled. Now, he wants revenge on the world in general and on Hollywood in particular. Bratt wears shoulder pads, dresses in purple jumpsuits and has a mullet-like haircut and moustache combo that might have embarrassed Hall and Oates. When he is pitted against his adversaries, he will challenge them to (dance fights). (The winner is the one who preens and wriggles the most.) His weapon of choice is super sticky, self-inflating pink bubble gum. His ultimate plan is to cover Los Angeles in this goo and then sit back and watch the city that rejected him float away into space. (The idea comes from one of the episodes of his old TV series.) In the meantime, he is busy stealing the world's most expensive jewel. Gru (voiced by Steve Carrell in that wonderfully weird, high-pitched middle European accent) is now one of the (goodies), working for the Anti-Villain League. He is supposed to be bringing Bratt to justice but makes such a hash of it that his bosses (kick him to the curb) and fire him. Even the minions lose faith in him. He is in strong need of redemption. The screenplay by Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio makes us aware of the yearnings of all the other main characters too. Gru's wife, kick-ass Anti-Villain League agent Lucy Wilde (voiced by Kristen Wiig) wants to prove herself as a mom to her adopted kids. Gru's newly discovered, much better looking twin brother Dru Gru (also voiced by Carrell), who's a wealthy pig farmer, is desperate to prove his credentials as a villain. The youngest of the kids, little moppet Agnes (Nev Scharrel) is on a quest to find a real-life unicorn. She almost bursts with excitement when she meets a bar-owner who claims to have seen one. The film makes us feel sympathy for these protagonists - and even a little pity for Bratt himself as he tries to re-live his glory days in the Eighties. However fantastical the plot becomes, the relationships between the characters remain straightforward enough. This means the film retains its emotional undertow. It helps that the faces of the humans are animated in such an expressive way: they all have huge, rapidly blinking eyes and their skin colour will change, reflecting their moods. At times, it's as if the minions are in their own, separate movie. They don't feature very prominently but are at the centre of two tremendous sequences. In one, the little yellow imps invade a Hollywood studio, stumble onto a sound stage where a TV"
103,SCO_Doc3_DespicableMe3,SCO_Doc3_DespicableMe3,SCO,Comedy,Positive,Despicable Me 3,"The third helping of the blockbuster Despicable Me series featuring Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig makes all the right moves - but to incrementally less successful effect The Despicable Me series has shown there is life outside Pixar and Disney, both commercially and artistically, in the blockbuster animation world, with its sentimental-querulous figurehead Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) and fondness for idiosyncratic grotesques. So here we are at number three - not counting, of course, the prequel-spinoff Minions, in which Gru's babbling army of small yellow helpers took centre stage. While all the elements that brought the first two Despicable Mes inordinate popularity are present and correct, it might perhaps be churlish to suggest that the charm is beginning to wear off - just a tiny bit. On the face of it, this third film simply extends the sentimental undertow of its predecessors. Having acquired children (in DM1) and a wife (Lucy, voiced by Kristen Wiig, in DM2), Gru this time discovers he has a twin, Dru (voiced, again, by Carell). Possessed of hair, a sunny outlook and substantial material possessions, Dru is pitched as the polar opposite to his surly, self-hating long-lost brother; he is also keen to re-establish the family tradition of supervillany - the very practice Gru has turned his back on. It's only a matter of minutes before a heated sibling rivalry is raging. Shortly before the reconnection with Dru, however, Gru and Lucy have managed to get themselves fired from their crimefighting org, the Anti Villain League, after botching the pursuit of a bubblegum-toting, Rubik's Cube-wielding supervillain Balthazar Bratt (South Park's Trey Parker). Bratt is a rather entertaining creation, even if it's the apotheosis of the movies' increasingly teethgrinding obsession with self-referential pop culture. Bratt is the former kiddie star of an 80s TV show and - complete with mullet hairstyle, weaponised guitar-synth and repeated challenges to dance-fights - utilises cheesy 80s style to ballast his villainous moves to take revenge for his Hollywood rejection. The extended sections devoted to Bratt, including a prologue in which he captures a ship containing the largest diamond in the world, are Despicable Me's best and funniest sequences, overflowing with ideas and gags. They also prompt the film's not-all-that-imaginative jukebox soundtrack of 80s hits - Michael Jackson's Bad, aHa's Take on Me, Madonna's Into the Groove. Perhaps younger members of the audience might consider them cultish ancient tunes, but to the slightly more seasoned filmgoer it's an indication that under the eyepopping lysergic visuals there's a basic unadventurousness to proceedings. Perhaps it's inevitable after the impressive impact the first in the series made, with its distinctive combination of daftness and dyspepsia; a sort of closing the circle. The Gru/Dru thread also shows the strain. It looks initially like it will provide rich easily-mined territory - including the sinister implication, apparent in their first meeting, that Dru might replace his brother in his family's affections. But it runs out of steam pretty quickly, with little made of their rivalry other"
104,SCO_Doc4_DespicableMe3,SCO_Doc4_DespicableMe3,SCO,Comedy,Positive,Despicable Me 3,"For all their extraordinary popularity, the Despicable Me films have never quite landed on a look or tone that felt ineffably them. You don't know what you'll necessarily get when queueing for one, apart from Minions, in the same way as you do for, say, a Lego Movie - a franchise that set out its all-gags-blazing aesthetic in the opening 0.3 seconds of its first instalment. That said, there was a memorably lovely sequence in the original Despicable Me (2010) in which uber-grouch Gru (voiced, then and now, by Steve Carell) takes his three adopted daughters to a seaside carnival: the foursome board a roller-coaster, Pharrell Williams fades up on the soundtrack, and Gru tries and fails to stifle his own excitement while the world flies past in a pastel-coloured rush. The moment has an authentic pop sweetness that Illumination Entertainment's films have struggled to recapture since - both within the Despicable cycle (of which this film, if you count 2015's Minions, is the fourth instalment), and outside of it, in Sing, The Secret Life of Pets, and the animation house's other injection-moulded side-projects. But Despicable Me 3 often comes close - a welcome turn of events that has less to do with the story at hand, which is as bitty and frivolous as ever, than a new-found sense of warmth and wonder in the computer-generated animation itself. It's evident straight away, in a fizzy prologue which tees up the bad guy du jour: a fallen child star called Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker) whose villainous M.O., along with his taste in clothes and music, is heavily 1980s-themed. This means self-inflating bubble-gum bombs, a keytar cannon that shoots out weaponised Van Halen riffs, flippers that allow the wearer to moonwalk over water, and more - ideas no less gimmicky than the fart gun and rocket-powered ballgown of previous instalments, but which are brought to life with more rainbow exuberance and tighter comic rhythms than the series has previously mustered. This goes double, literally, once Gru and his long-lost blond twin Dru (who's also voiced by Carell) join forces, in complimentary black and white bodysuits, to retrieve a giant rose diamond Bratt has pinched from a Paris museum.The brothers' mission is like a Spy vs. Spy strip crossed with a Friz Freleng Pink Panther cartoon: in fact, given the colours of the precious stone and costumes involved, it's not inconceivable that this was the exact creative brief the directors, Kyle Balda and Pierre Coffin, were working from. Either way, it's consistently funny, with the kind of well-orchestrated slapstick moments where you can actually feel the stick slap.A]s for the Minions, they're mostly hived off in a subplot of their own, in which the performance of a big Gilbert and Sullivan-inspired number on primetime television leads directly to incarceration. This lends the film the air of a $75 million plate-spinning exercise: in addition to Gru's fraternal reunion and the Minions' adventures, there's a subplot in which Gru's new wife Lucy (Kristen Wiig) bonds"
105,SCO_Doc5_DespicableMe3,SCO_Doc5_DespicableMe3,SCO,Comedy,Positive,Despicable Me 3,"Whatever the mood, you'll find yourself in a better one after watching Despicable Me 3. The exhilarating '80s music, a revivified Gru (Steve Carell) and a lesson in family all join to form a mosh pit of a movie that still makes you ultimately smile. The tone is set even before the opening title card with Gru and Lucy (Kristen Wiig) -- his wife and now-fellow Anti-Villain League agent -- hot on the trail of Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker). Bratt is a quite literal child star gone bad (or method): He's become his character from a cheesy '80s TV show called Evil Bratt, in which he played a kid bent on destruction. Tagline? ""I've been a bad boy."" Once puberty hit, Bratt's show was canceled and so was he. He now wants to do to Hollywood what it did to him, chew it up and spit it out, all while wearing the clothes and stuck in the era that Hollywood handed to him. Meta, much? Bratt is a McGuffin, though a mullet-coiffed, dancing-machine one. The real story here is family. Gru made his own with the Minions, then his girls and his new wife. But now comes a revelation: Gru has a shiny, happy brother, with seemingly everything Gru ever wanted, especially that shampoo-commercial hair. But his brother Dru (also Steve Carell) harbors a dark secret. He wants to be bad. But, as bad as Gru can sometimes be at being good, his brother is even worse at being bad. He pressures Gru to keep living up to a legacy that Gru didn't even realize he was perpetuating. That's enough for two movies, but then there are subplots, some contrived, and borrowed plot devices -- I see you Parent Trap -- that are everywhere and nowhere at once. For the emotional payoff, they hardly seem worth the time; really, a search for a unicorn? Then again, what may seem peripatetic to grownups serves as distraction and diversion to little ones. One can hardly write the word distraction without following with mention of the Minions, who find their forces reduced early after Gru rebuffs their calls to ""go dark"" after the encounter with Bratt leaves the family unemployed. That allows the film to get in a Star Wars gag -- and to breathe without having to cater to them and their proud fan base; rudderless, the Minions end up in jail for much of the movie. (Perhaps a timeout is in order after their own movie in 2015?) Picked apart, Despicable Me 3 can be fun and off-putting. First, it never takes itself that seriously, and neither should its audience. Then, even the in jokes have in jokes.The filmmakers may have stuffed 3 with everything and the kitchen sink, perhaps drawing inspiration from the decade to which it pays homage, or maybe they just felt as if the end is nigh. But then, it also sets up a Spy vs. Spy-like continuation, if anyone is so inclined. Taken as a whole,"
106,SCO_Doc6_DespicableMe3,SCO_Doc6_DespicableMe3,SCO,Comedy,Negative,Despicable Me 3,"With its combination of vaguely European stylings, a storyline that effectively combines slapstick and sentiment and the scene-stealing antics of the gibberish-spouting sentient Twinkies known as the Minions, (Despicable Me) (2010) was a breath of reasonably fresh air in the crowded feature animation marketplace that went on to be a massive success throughout the world. The inevitable (Despicable Me 2) (2013) was an equally big hit from a financial standpoint but lacked the freshness of the original and the storyline was largely forgettable. And even though the Minions once again more or less stole the show, even they began to wear out their welcome a bit. That became especially obvious in the spin-off vehicle (Minions) (2015), a film that did little other than illustrate to youngsters the notion of there being too much of a good thing. Now comes (Despicable Me 3,) a depressingly rote piece of corporate product that has so little on its mind other than presumably making hundreds of millions of dollars that you half expect the ticket sellers to hand out copies of Comcast's latest earnings report along with the 3-D glasses. Having been inspired by his three adorable adopted daughters-Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Grier) and Agnes (Nev Scharrel)-to give up a life of super-villainy, Gru (Steve Carrell) is working as an agent for the Anti-Villainy League alongside new wife Lucy (Kristen Wiig). As the film opens, the two try to stop the fiendish Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), a former kid star from the 80's seeking revenge on the world for cancelling his TV show ((Evil Bratt)), from stealing the world's largest diamond with the aid of a robot sidekick, scientifically enhanced bubble gum and a keytar capable of playing the most familiar musical riffs of his favorite era. Although he saves the diamond, Gru lets Balthazar get away and as a result, the new head of the AVL (Jenny Slate in a strangely brief role) fires both him and Lucy. No sooner has Gru suffered this professional setback than his personal world is rocked as well when he is contacted by his heretofore-unknown twin brother Dru (also Carrell) and invited to meet him at his home on the faraway land of Freedonia. (If the name (Freedonia) rings any bells with you, consider that a potential signal that you might be just a little too old for this film.) Gru and the family fly off to Freedonia and discover that Dru is fabulously wealthy and handsome. But just as the even-more-depressed Gru is about to leave, Dru confesses the real reason for summoning his brother-he wants his sibling to teach him the tricks of the super-villain trade so that he can also carry on in the family tradition. Gru refuses at first but since Balthazar has managed to steal that diamond in the interim, he figures that if he can break into Bratt's lair-an isolated compound topped by a giant Rubik's Cube-and steal it back, he and Lucy will be reinstated in the AVL.

107,SCO_Doc7_DespicableMe3,SCO_Doc7_DespicableMe3,SCO,Comedy,Negative,Despicable Me 3,"The latest entry in the expanding franchise is overstuffed with a confusing plot, dated jokes, and a lack of attention to its biggest stars. It's clear from the opening minutes of (Despicable Me 3) that the popular Illumination Entertainment franchise has lost the thread on what makes the series so appealing to its target audience (you know, kids). The latest film in the expanding canon of (Despicable Me) features - which has grown to include a Minion-centric spinoff, plus more to come - gamely opens with a fart-laden studio logo before introducing the series' newest villain, a cast-off has-been television star literally named Evil Bratt. Voiced by Trey Parker, the balding Bratt is a weirdo riff on classic '80s TV characters like Small Wonder and Punky Brewster, complete with a sassy robot friend and a keytar he uses to play such jams as (Sussudio) and (Take on Me,) a role entirely dependent on the audience's knowledge of the kind of roles he's skewering. He seems unlikely to appeal to - or amuse - the younger set, but at least he's got a little flair, something the rest of the film is severely lacking. Now firmly settled into his dual roles as good-guy secret agent and family man, former baddie Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) has been battling Bratt for ages by the time the Rubik's Cube-loving villain hatches a plan to steal the world's biggest diamond, an evil deed he intends to complete by way of some evil bubblegum (yes) and an even worse attitude (he's still clinging to his TV-issued catchphrase (I've been a baaaad boy!)). The throwback character is amusing at first blush, but he soon feels as if he's been plucked from another movie and stuffed inside this one - a common problem throughout the rest of (Despicable Me 3.) Bratt is mad because his decades-old television series, which was about him being a kid super-villain, was cancelled when he unexpectedly entered puberty. With no other skill set to his name, he's bent on two things: being a real villain and taking down the entertainment industry that shunned him. (You know how much children love dismantling capitalism.) The diamond is part of that convoluted plan, and after outsmarting Gru and his wife, fellow agent Lucy (voiced by Kristen Wiig) yet again, Bratt makes off with the giant gem. Gru's journey from bad villain to inept agent has framed up the series so far, but the third (Despicable Me) film still finds him struggling to succeed, even when supported by Lucy, who is twice the agent he'll ever be. Gru's issues haven't changed over the course of three films, and (Despicable Me 3) finds no new emotion or insight in the recycled plotline, one whose charms wore off during the first film and have yet to bounce back. When the pair's agency gets a new head - voiced by Jenny Slate in a thankless role that makes her amusing turn in the animated (The Secret Life of Pets)"
108,SCO_Doc8_DespicableMe3,SCO_Doc8_DespicableMe3,SCO,Comedy,Negative,Despicable Me 3,"'Despicable Me 3' is so bad it's almost unendurable Even the title seems off. If we needed this third film about a reformed supervillain named Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), his ever-expanding family, his endlessly merchandisable Minions and his increasingly tiresome Manichaean struggle, it really should have been called (Despicable We.) After all, the new movie's main plot point is the reunion of Gru with Dru (also Carell), the identical twin brother he never knew he had - a lame brand-extending contrivance that comes straight out of (The Parent Trap.) You might describe (Despicable Me 3) as a parent trap, too, though probably not the kind that the hard-working people at Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment had in mind. Don't get me wrong: Parents of young kids tend to develop a high tolerance for the mass-produced mediocrity that typically passes for children's entertainment and will happily endure a lot of it in exchange for 90 minutes' worth of (relative) peace and quiet. But (Despicable Me 3,) written by Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio, is close to unendurable. Under the pretext of offering fun for the whole family, the movie winds up doing almost precisely the opposite; its attempts at grown-up sophistication and cheeky, knowing humor are clueless and hectoring enough to leave any adult in the audience wishing they'd been straight-up ignored. Most of the pain arrives courtesy of new uber-baddie Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), the former child star of a long-forgotten '80s TV show whose memory he now seeks to avenge. To that end, he wears a hideous mullet (sorry if I'm being redundant) and mile-high shoulder pads, and his every appearance summons forth a blast of popular music from that much-derided decade. Michael Jackson's (Bad) is unsurprisingly high on the playlist as are similarly obvious candidates like (Take My Breath Away) and (Take on Me.) By the time the movie tosses in a 10-second excerpt from (99 Luftballons,) you might find yourself less amused than enraged. Not because the songs aren't fun, but because even their wan nostalgia value feels cheapened and diminished by directors Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda, who treat every element on their broad, busy canvas with the same undiscriminating junkyard sensibility that has become synonymous with the Illumination Entertainment brand (see also (The Secret Life of Pets) and (Dr. Seuss' The Lorax.) If you must). The plot is set in motion when Bratt uses bubble-gum bombs and a weaponized keytar to steal an enormous diamond. Failing to capture their new nemesis, Gru and his new wife, Lucy (Kristen Wiig), are stripped of their crime-fighting credentials by the Anti-Villain League, which has come under tough new management (Jenny Slate, briefly heard). But the stresses of unemployment are temporarily put on hold when Gru learns from his estranged mother (Julie Andrews) that he has a twin brother, Dru, from whom he was separated at birth. Along with Lucy and his three adopted daughters - the mature Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), the mischievous Edith (Dana Gaier) and the"

Or rather, like multiple episodes of a TV show, all airing at once. As such, it makes for a rather disjointed experience. It's loud and busy and desperately wants you to like it, like an attention starved child who keeps tugging at your shirt tail. (Like me! Notice me!) it screams, from the opening frames right up until the closing credits. Kids movies weren't always like this. Once upon a time they were patient and unhurried, but those days are long since gone, and (Despicable Me 3) follows the modern mold to a T. More, more, more, the louder and the faster the seemingly better has been the M.O. for some time. (Even the good ones suffer from bloat; most Pixar movies tend to end with an apocalypse of effects whirring by on screen.) Amid the chaos, here's a partial list of the various things going on in (Despicable Me 3): An evil, '80s-obsessed former child star named Balthazar Bratt (voiced by (South Park's) Trey Parker) is on a rampage and is out to steal a giant pink diamond and destroy Hollywood; Gru (Steve Carell), the series' star and former bad guy turned bad guy-chasing agent, is fired from the Anti-Villain League after failing to apprehend Bratt during the opening sequence; Gru learns he has a long-lost twin brother, Dru (also Carell, doing a truly grating sort-of Swedish-by-way-of-Russian accent), who wants Gru to return to his dastardly ways; Agnes, the youngest of three adoptive daughters of Gru and his wife Lucy (Kristen Wiig), is on a mission to find out if unicorns are real; The Minions, the little yellow creatures that look like banana stumps and who out in the real world have been merchandised within an inch of their life, leave Gru behind, wind up on an (American Idol)-style singing competition, land in jail, plot their escape to break out and perform choreographed dance routines to Pharrell Williams songs. That's pretty busy, and director trio (!) Kyle Balda, Pierre Coffin and Eric Guillon shuffle between these stories like they're flipping channels. The hope is that the more they throw at you, something will stick, and they'll wind up hitting on something for everybody: action for the boys, unicorns for the girls, Minions for the Minion completists (they're their own group), '80s pop music references for the parents. The truth that emerges through it all is the (Despicable Me) franchise is running out of gas; in addition to the first two films, there was also a (Minions) standalone effort in 2015. The (long lost twin brother) angle is a staple of narratives that have begun spinning their wheels, and it's surprising this franchise went there so fast, but here we are. Within the movie, there are some asides that feel like in-jokes on the production. (I miss the Minions,) Gru says"

Despicable Me has also had shorts and I saw a few of them like the House Makeover one, the Training Wheels one, and the one that played before Secret Life of Pets. The Training Wheels one was okay, the House Makeover one was pretty good, but the one that played before Secret Life of Pets was sub-par. I think that they need to stop milking this franchise because Despicable Me is just getting worse and worse with each movie and short and from the cliffhanger in the end, I could tell that there's probably going to be a fourth one about Dru's career as a villain. And what's going to happen? Dru and maybe even Gru are going to meet their dad who they haven't seen in a long time and maybe bring him into the family? Are the girls going to find out that their biological parents abandoned them and leave Gru to live with their parents? And what if they make a T.V. series? None of the characters I thought were very good and are shadows of their former selves. The new characters, Evil Bratt is obvious and Dru is an unnecessary character, he caused trouble for Gru and doesn't even know how to drive yet he has a car. Lucy is annoying with how aggressive and hyper she acts and an unnecessary mom and teammate of Gru and she and Gru are burdening a 6-year-old little girl with stuff about work. Which I think is too much for a 6 year old to comprehend. Not to mention, the kids act too precocious now. Like how could a 6-year-old girl know how to cook soup? She also sold her unicorn, well, Despicable Me is dead now. Isn't she too young to be even thinking about businesses anyway? And she adopts a goat? Why would she adopt a wild animal? And the minions are now more annoying trouble-makers than ever. There are too many popular songs in there. But I really loved the end credits song. This movie is kind of like a rehash of Despicable Me 1, 2, and Minions. A villain causes destruction to the town towards the end, the girls get kidnapped by the villain, and a boy falls in love with Margo and even talks about getting engaged with her even though they're too young. And he also does embarrassing things such as smooching all over her. Edith's voice actor sounded a bit too old for her age. There are a few good things to say about this film, the action scenes are alright, there were some heart-warming moments between Gru and Dru and I like how they help each other, and I also like how they got three different stories going on, one about Lucy and the girls, one about the Minions, and one about Gru and"
111,JCQ_Doc1_HolmesAndWatson,JCQ_Doc1_HolmesAndWatson,JCQ,Comedy,Positive,Holmes and Watson,"If you're the type of person who's generally immune to the humor of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, then it's safe to say that Holmes and Watson will be just as loathsome to you as their previous collaborations. But if, like me, you think Ferrell and Reilly are a dynamic comedy duo with a knack for irreverent, absurdist humor, then you're likely to enjoy this loosey-goosey, low-brow send-up of Arthur Conan Doyle's famous characters. As with many of Ferrell's and Reilly's films, the plot of Holmes and Watson is secondary to the comedy, which involves a lot of mugging, physical humor, and banter between the two leads. In this case, they play Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson, respectively, as they attempt to solve a mystery involving the Queen of England (Pam Ferris) and her plans to assassinate someone at Buckingham Palace. Of course, the mystery is largely an excuse for Ferrell and Reilly to engage in a series of ridiculous hijinks and one-liners. They're aided in their efforts by an eccentric cast of characters, including Rebecca Hall as Dr. Grace Hart, a feminist doctor who clashes with Watson over her unorthodox methods; and Ralph Fiennes as Moriarty, the nefarious villain who's orchestrating the assassination plot. The humor in Holmes and Watson is broad and silly, but it's often clever and unexpected, too. There are plenty of sight gags and physical comedy set pieces, but there are also some genuinely witty one-liners and running jokes that had me chuckling throughout. Ferrell and Reilly have great chemistry together, and they play off each other's strengths as performers: Ferrell is the bigger, broader comic, while Reilly is the more understated and deadpan. Granted, not every joke lands, and some of the humor is undoubtedly crude or juvenile. But that's par for the course with Ferrell and Reilly, and if you're on their wavelength, then you'll be able to overlook the film's occasional misfires. And at just 90 minutes, Holmes and Watson never overstays its welcome. Overall, I found Holmes and Watson to be an entertaining, if undeniably goofy, comedy that's worth checking out for fans of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly. If you're in the mood for some silly, irreverent humor that doesn't take itself too seriously, then this film might be just what you're looking for. Despite the film's broad comedy and lack of detail, Ferrell and Reilly carry the film effortlessly. Their easy rapport, which is showcased in brief flashbacks to their childhood, makes for believable lifelong friends. Ferrell and Reilly's performances are aided by a supporting cast that hits all the right beats. The film even includes a cameo that will have fans of an unexpected Ferrell classic jumping out of their seats with glee. For all its flaws, Holmes and Watson is an enjoyable diversion that harks back to an era of comedy films that don't try to be anything more than what they are. Holmes and Watson is a movie that remembers that comedy is"

It's also very, very Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly. Ferrell and Reilly play, respectively, Sherlock Holmes and his partner Dr. John Watson, who solve crimes in late 19th century London. This incarnation of Holmes is a preening, egotistical dandy who seems more interested in his own legend than in solving mysteries. This Watson is a bit dim but has a warm heart and an upbeat, can-do spirit. They're both ridiculous, but that's the point: The movie is a series of riffs on the idea that these two titans of detection are actually fakes who are lucky to solve any cases at all. The film starts with a promising opening scene in which Ferrell's Holmes uses his deductive skills to sass out the lives of various people he encounters on the street, making hilariously incorrect assumptions about them. We quickly meet Watson, who's trying to save a man's life by performing a blood transfusion, but keeps getting distracted by Holmes, who's playing his beloved violin and mugging for an unseen audience. This scene sets the tone for the movie's brand of humor, which isn't particularly cerebral, but is refreshingly unpretentious. The main plot involves Holmes and Watson trying to prevent the murder of Queen Victoria (Pam Ferris) at Buckingham Palace. They're helped and hindered by a motley crew of supporting characters, including a feminist doctor (Rebecca Hall), a criminal mastermind (Ralph Fiennes), and a morgue attendant (Lauren Lapkus) who's so eager to be a detective that she can't help but blurt out all the obvious clues. There are plenty of sight gags and slapstick in ""Holmes and Watson,"" but there are also some surprisingly smart one-liners, delivered with dry wit by Reilly or Ferrell, depending on the moment. The humor is often irreverent, but it's never mean-spirited or cruel. And even when the jokes fall flat, as they occasionally do, the movie never feels like it's trying too hard to be funny. At its best, Holmes and Watson recalls some of the great spoofs of the past, like ""Airplane!"" or ""The Naked Gun,"" movies that had a way of lampooning genres without ever feeling like they were condescending to them. There's a sense of affectionate ribbing at work here, as if Ferrell and Reilly, and Cohen, are saying, ""We know these characters are beloved, but come on, they're kind of ridiculous, too, right?"" If you're able to appreciate that kind of self-awareness, then you'll likely find a lot to enjoy in this goofy, good-natured comedy. Holmes and Watson may not be for everyone, but it is the most intentionally funny comedy that makes you laugh out loud"
113,JCQ_Doc3_HolmesAndWatson,JCQ_Doc3_HolmesAndWatson,JCQ,Comedy,Positive,Holmes and Watson,"What is clear is that the film is silly and consistently amusing, and fans of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly will find much to enjoy here. The story follows the pairing of the famed detective and his assistant in a plot that grows increasingly complicated and silly, taking them through a number of subplots and into contact with a variety of amusing characters. As with much of Ferrell and Reilly's work, much of the humor here comes from absurdity and broad physical comedy, and there's plenty of that to go around. The main plot, such as it is, sees Holmes and Watson attempting to solve a mystery involving a threat to Queen Victoria's life. Along the way, they're introduced to a number of suspects and potential collaborators, and each interaction provides a moment of humor, often relying on the leads' own comedic strengths. Ferrell is as over-the-top as ever, offering a character who is supremely confident even when he's entirely out of his depth. Reilly, on the other hand, plays Watson with a kind of downtrodden resignation that feels genuine, even when he's spouting nonsense. Perhaps the most interesting thing about Holmes and Watson, however, is the way it adapts the pair's relationship to fit a modern audience. While there's nothing inherently queer about the original stories, the notion of a deeply devoted male friendship, even one that never crosses into romance, is something that is often read into the characters. In Holmes and Watson, there are a number of moments that lean into that interpretation, including an ongoing gag where the two are forced to share a single bed, and a scene where they're mistaken for a gay couple. Of course, such moments are played for laughs, but they're also genuinely affectionate, offering something that's fairly rare in mainstream comedies: a depiction of male intimacy that isn't predicated on violence or homophobic humor. There's a genuine warmth to the leads' interactions, and while their characters may not be particularly well-drawn, their friendship is. Overall, Holmes and Watson is a fairly standard entry in the Ferrell/Reilly catalog, offering plenty of laughs and absurdity, but not much in the way of depth or nuance. However, the film's take on the characters' relationship is notable, offering something that feels genuinely affectionate and refreshing in a genre that often leans on outdated and harmful humor. Holmes and Watson may not be high art, but it's frequently hilarious, boasting some memorable one-liners and uproarious sight gags. More importantly, though, the film makes a case for Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly as one of the great comedic duos of their generation, even if they're taking on such established characters as Holmes and Watson. There's something contagious about their camaraderie, their eagerness to play off each other with the precision of a well-honed comedy team. Variety's review of Holmes and Watson also praises the chemistry between the two leads, as well as the film's ability to blend humor with mystery. Ferrell and Reilly have"
114,JCQ_Doc4_HolmesAndWatson,JCQ_Doc4_HolmesAndWatson,JCQ,Comedy,Positive,Holmes and Watson,"Their chemistry remains as strong as ever and is what ultimately carries the film. The humor is described as ""goofy and slapstick,"" making it a good fit for fans of Ferrell and Reilly's previous collaborations. You can feel the flop sweat emanating from the third onscreen pairing of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly. Making their previous vehicles Step Brothers and Talladega Nights seem the height of comic sophistication by comparison, Holmes and Watson features the duo parodying Arthur Conan Doyle's famous characters to devastatingly unfunny effect. Numerous talented British thespians are wasted in supporting roles in this Christmas turkey that, not surprisingly, wasn't screened in advance for critics. Although making them troop out to theaters Christmas morning is something of which even Ebenezer Scrooge wouldn't have approved. Written and directed by Etan Cohen (previously responsible for the similarly witless Ferrell comedy Get Hard), the film begins with a prologue featuring a schoolboy Holmes being bullied by his boarding school classmates. The humiliation drives young Sherlock to suppress his emotions in favor of cold, calculating logic, which, as origin stories go, won't cause Spider-Man to lose any sleep. Cut to the grown Holmes and Watson attempting to thwart their nemesis Professor Moriarty (Ralph Fiennes, mainly letting his beard do the acting) and solving crimes. When a dead body is found inside a giant birthday cake at Buckingham Palace, the duo is charged by Queen Victoria (Pam Ferris) with the task of investigating the case. Assisting them in their efforts are the American Dr. Grace Hart (Rebecca Hall) and her mute assistant Millicent (a very funny Lauren Lapkus, practically stealing the film), who was ""raised by cats."" The two women become love interests for the bachelor duo, with Watson and Grace bonding while performing an autopsy to the strains of ""Unchained Melody"" and Holmes becoming enchanted by the daffy Millicent. There's at least one scene that proves mildly amusing, when Holmes silently communicates with his brother Mycroft (Hugh Laurie, who had the good sense to go uncredited) via their shared ability to ""brain speak."" It's a slyly witty moment that contrasts with the otherwise lame slapstick permeating the frenetic proceedings. A gag involving the eating of raw onions isn't so much running as limping. And there's a strange amount of anachronistic Donald Trump-related humor, including bits about fake news and red MAGA hats (here reading ""Make England Great Again"") that fall utterly flat in this context. But those are certainly preferable to the laborious scene in which Holmes and Watson desperately try to hide the body of the apparently dead queen, or the Disney-style musical number performed by Ferrell and Reilly that at least sounds authentic thanks to having been composed by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater. A subplot involving the Titanic seems mainly designed to showcase a cameo by one of the stars of James Cameron's film about the doomed ship, which presumably played funnier in the writers' room than it does onscreen. Ferrell and Reilly flounder in their titular"

I just can't help it but when I see Will Ferrell's face I already have to laugh. I laugh with all his movies so I wasn't surprised I did like this movie much more than I'm supposed to when you consider the low ratings. Will Ferrell played Holmes in his typical way, a bit clumsy and dumb but always funny to watch. John C. Reilly was just perfect as Watson, even better than Will Ferrell in my opinion. Holmes and Watson is just another good comedy if you like Will Ferrell's style of humor. If not, too bad. Holmes and Watson was good light hearted fun. It never tries to be anything its not. It knows its a comedy and delivers on it. Holmes and Watson is not an Oscar contender and it never intends to be one but deliver some light hearted comedy. The pitch is simple, it's the holidays and the year is winding up so it's time for some easy and carefree laughs. This film delivers. This movie is a parody about Sherlock Holmes movies. And a damn good one. If you are fan of John C Reilly and Will Ferrell (like I am) and a fan of Doyle and Holmes and Watson stories (like me), then this is a movie just for you (me!). Every joke and scene is a full joy and those mocking about previous Sherlock movies is very well succeeded. I laughed and had fun. I'm not going to try to convince anyone that Holmes and Watson is a good movie, but I will say this: If you've seen and enjoyed Step Brothers, Talladega Nights, and/or Anchorman, there's a chance you might find something to like about this one too. The material here is weaker than in any of those movies, but the delivery from Ferrell and Reilly is still on point. If nothing else, they seem to be having a blast hamming it up as two of literature's most beloved characters, and there's a certain delight in watching their interactions, even when they're as ludicrous as they are here. There is something special about a really good dumb comedy. Holmes and Watson is not a good movie, but it is a great one. It is an admirably dumb comedy, a throwback to a kind of satirical slapstick that was largely lost in the transition to mainstream stoner comedies. Like something out of an early Adam Sandler movie or a forgotten Marx Brothers comedy, Etan Cohen's 89-minute laugh fest is essentially one long series of jokes and gags, with little in the way of dramatic stakes or character development. But the jokes land and the gags amuse, and I was never not entertained by what I was watching. There is a certain liberation in watching a movie that is content to make you laugh and nothing else. Holmes and Watson, a variation of the iconic literary detective,"
116,JCQ_Doc6_HolmesAndWatson,JCQ_Doc6_HolmesAndWatson,JCQ,Comedy,Negative,Holmes and Watson,"Holmes and Watson is a bad movie, a dreadful miscalculation from writer/director Etan Cohen that does absolutely nothing right. The movie doesn't work as a parody of the original Arthur Conan Doyle stories, a broad slapstick comedy, or a period-piece satire. It's a dud, a lemon, a steaming pile of Victorian garbage. Holmes and Watson wastes an enormous amount of talent on something that looks like a rough draft of a script that Cohen wrote on the back of a cocktail napkin at a karaoke bar. Ferrell and Reilly are great actors with a natural comic chemistry, but they're reduced to doing lazy bits about Holmes and Watson as bickering old married couples or awkwardly riffing on modern slang. Ralph Fiennes appears as Holmes' arch-nemesis Moriarty, and the two-time Oscar nominee is given nothing interesting to do. Ditto for Hugh Laurie as Sherlock's older brother Mycroft. The film has some visual humor, most of it at the expense of the title characters' apparent lack of hygiene. But most of the jokes feel like half-baked ideas that someone forgot to flesh out before filming began. There's a weird subplot about Queen Victoria's romance novel writing that goes nowhere, and a running gag about a character named Millie who gets less funny each time she appears. By the time the credits roll and Ferrell and Reilly break out into a song called ""I Will Survive"" for no apparent reason, you'll feel more like you've been held captive than entertained. Holmes and Watson is a film that has nothing to say and no idea how to say it. It's not clever, it's not funny, it's not exciting, it's not romantic, it's not scary, it's not mysterious, it's not insightful, it's not interesting, and it's not anything else you might want a movie to be. It's a movie you watch with a slack jaw and a confused expression, wondering how anyone could have made something so bad with so many talented people. It's a mystery as unsolvable as anything Conan Doyle ever wrote. Holmes and Watson is a painfully unfunny comedy that misses the mark on every level. The film is hampered by a weak script, lackluster performances, and uninspired direction. The jokes are tired, the physical comedy is stale, and the entire premise feels like a bad joke that went on for way too long. It's a shame, because Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly are both talented comedians, but they are let down by a film that never quite manages to find its footing. The film has no discernible plot to speak of, which means that it is entirely reliant on the humor to carry it through. Unfortunately, the humor is painfully unfunny. The jokes are predictable, the physical comedy is tired, and the entire premise is just plain dumb. Even Will Ferrell's patented brand of absurd humor can't save this one. It's a disappointing effort all around, and a waste of a talented cast. I recommend that if you have a"
117,JCQ_Doc7_HolmesAndWatson,JCQ_Doc7_HolmesAndWatson,JCQ,Comedy,Negative,Holmes and Watson,"Holmes and Watson is the most witless Sherlock Holmes adaptation to date. The film's first and most enduring problem is its script, which is credited to director Etan Cohen (who co-wrote Tropic Thunder) but feels like a cobbled-together assemblage of bits and bobs from the cutting-room floor. Very few scenes have anything like internal logic or momentum, and the cast are left to wander about the place, waggling their eyebrows and mugging for the camera. The performers are not helped by the film's manic overuse of fast cutting, awkward close-ups and protracted reaction shots; nothing lingers long enough for any tension to build, or any jokes to land. Will Ferrell and John C Reilly, reunited after Step Brothers and Talladega Nights, are left stranded in the title roles, hollering non sequiturs in the hope of finding something funny. The supporting cast includes Rebecca Hall, Rob Brydon and Ralph Fiennes, but they too are lost in the melee. As for the ""humour"" itself, Holmes and Watson has no discernible tone or texture, veering between desperate attempts at slapstick and more contemporary mugging, including a late, ill-judged riff on hip-hop dance moves. It also feels retrograde, indulging in the most regressive of gender and racial stereotypes. Holmes's landlady, for instance, is depicted as a lustful, gap-toothed harridan; the film's centerpiece ""comic"" set piece involves Watson trying to perform CPR on the Queen (Pam Ferris), who promptly farts in his face. It's not even worth getting into the film's abysmal plotting and pacing. Holmes and Watson is so slapdash that it makes Guy Ritchie's busy, chatty Sherlock Holmes films look like studies in narrative clarity and grace. It's a film of insipid gags, and of actors who seem to have lost their way. An absolute turkey. Holmes and Watson is a bad movie. It's an awful movie. It's an unfunny, boring mess of a movie. It's not just a bad comedy, it's a bad film, period. This is a movie that, if it had a shred of self-awareness, would be embarrassed to exist. Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly reunite to play Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson, respectively. But the two of them, and everyone else involved in the production, seem to be under the impression that all they have to do is put on some silly hats and speak in exaggerated British accents, and the audience will just laugh and laugh. That's not how comedy works. Holmes and Watson is one of those movies where you can visibly see the actors trying to keep themselves entertained while the camera is rolling. They laugh, they smirk, they look at each other like they're sharing a private joke. But there's no joke there. There's just dead air. As the plot unfolds, it becomes increasingly clear that no one cared about what was being put onscreen. Scenes feel like rough drafts, with the script seemingly written on a napkin minutes before the cameras started rolling. The humor is lazy, juvenile, and not particularly clever."

It's so bad, you start to wonder whether the fact that the thing exists is some elaborate act of performance art, a meta-commentary on how much we'll put up with in the name of comedy. It's so bad, it makes you reevaluate the past work of everyone involved. As mentioned, Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly team up again to play the legendary detective and his sidekick, respectively. But it's clear that neither of them wants to be there. The usual game Ferrell seems to be going through the motions, delivering his lines with a weary lack of enthusiasm. Reilly fares a bit better, but even he looks like he's ready to jump ship at any moment. The script, credited to director Etan Cohen, is terrible. Every joke is either painfully obvious or makes no sense whatsoever. There's a running gag involving Queen Victoria and her sexual desires that somehow manages to be both distasteful and unfunny. A scene in which Holmes and Watson attempt to perform CPR on the Queen is supposed to be the centerpiece of the film, but it's just an interminable mess. Holmes and Watson is the kind of movie that makes you lose faith in humanity. It's a movie so bad, it feels like an insult to your intelligence. It's a movie that makes you wonder how it got made, and why anyone thought it would be a good idea. If you're looking for a good comedy, look elsewhere. Holmes and Watson is a disaster. Holmes and Watson is one of the most painfully unfunny comedies in recent memory. It's hard to believe that a film starring Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly could be so devoid of humor, but this movie manages to achieve just that. The jokes are lazy, the plot is nonsensical, and the pacing is all over the place. It's clear that no one involved with this film cared about making a good movie, and it shows in every frame. Holmes and Watson is a disaster of a film. It's a shame, because Will Ferrell and John C.

However, the script is so poorly written, and the direction is so uninspired that they have no chance of making this film work. The jokes fall flat, the pacing is uneven, and the whole thing feels like a lazy cash grab. It's best to skip this one altogether. I can't remember the last time I watched a comedy that was this unfunny. Holmes and Watson is a complete misfire on every level. The jokes are crass, the characters are unlikable, and the pacing is all over the place.

Reilly in a Sherlock Holmes comedy may sound like an inspired idea, Holmes and Watson falls far short of its comic potential. Directed and written by Etan Cohen, whose resume includes ""Men in Black III"" and ""Get Hard,"" this cinematic misfire represents a miscalculation on nearly every level. Despite the presence of two of the funniest men in movies today, Holmes and Watson simply isn't very funny. Ferrell and Reilly play the titular characters, but they seem to be sleepwalking through their roles. Ferrell's portrayal of the iconic detective is strangely subdued, while Reilly's Watson is mostly forgettable. The two actors have previously displayed a comedic chemistry in ""Talladega Nights"" and ""Step Brothers,"" but here they seem to be working at cross purposes. The jokes are half-hearted, and the actors look like they're struggling to make them work. The plot of Holmes and Watson is thin and threadbare, with the central mystery revolving around an attempt on Queen Victoria's life. The film's supporting cast includes Rebecca Hall as a feminist doctor who joins forces with the two detectives, and Ralph Fiennes as Holmes' arch-nemesis, Professor Moriarty. Hall does her best with a thankless role, but Fiennes is miscast and underutilized. The humor in Holmes and Watson mostly consists of lame puns and tired slapstick. There's a running gag involving a flatulent horse that wears out its welcome early on, and an extended sequence in which the characters engage in a game of guess what I'm holding in my pocket. These attempts at humor are so feeble that they elicit more groans than laughs. One of the main problems with Holmes and Watson is that it lacks the inspired lunacy of the best comedies. It feels like a project that was put together by committee, with little thought given to whether the jokes actually work. The pacing is slack, the editing is choppy, and the film never builds up any momentum. In the end, Holmes and Watson is a disappointment on every level. Despite the presence of two talented actors, it simply doesn't deliver the laughs that audiences will be expecting. The film feels like a missed opportunity, a project that could have been so much better if it had been handled with more care and attention to detail. It's hard to imagine how a film that pairs Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly could be anything but hilarious, but Holmes and Watson manages to be a complete dud. The film is an exercise in lazy writing, predictable jokes, and tired physical comedy. It's a shame, because the concept of a comedic Sherlock Holmes story had a lot of potential, but this film squanders that potential at every turn.

Written and directed by Etan Cohen, who previously penned the more enjoyable ""Tropic Thunder,"" the movie feels like a lazy afterthought, a tossed-off comedy that nobody involved in the production really cared about. For starters, the chemistry between the two leads, Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, is nonexistent. Ferrell plays Holmes as a man of great intellect but no social skills, while Reilly's Watson is a bumbling sidekick who exists solely to react to Ferrell's antics. Both actors have proven themselves capable of being very funny in the past, but here they are stranded with a script that never provides them with anything resembling a joke. The plot revolves around a conspiracy to assassinate Queen Victoria, which gives Holmes and Watson a chance to team up with an American doctor played by Rebecca Hall. Hall is a fine actress, but her character is given so little to do that she might as well not be in the movie at all. The same could be said for Kelly Macdonald, who plays the housekeeper at 221B Baker Street and pops up occasionally to look disapproving. The movie's attempts at humor mostly involve Ferrell and Reilly making ridiculous faces or engaging in cartoonish physical comedy. Occasionally, there are references to other Sherlock Holmes stories or characters, but these are deployed so haphazardly that they barely register. At one point, Holmes and Watson have a run-in with a character who is presumably meant to be Irene Adler, but the movie doesn't bother to explain who she is or why we should care. Cohen's direction is uninspired, with the camera pointed squarely at the actors and little in the way of visual imagination. The production design is similarly lackluster, with none of the sumptuous detail that one might expect from a period piece. In the end, Holmes and Watson is a waste of everyone's time and talent. It's not even bad in an interesting way, like the infamous ""The Room."" It's just a dud, a movie that leaves you wondering how so much money and effort could be spent on something so thoroughly forgettable. Holmes and Watson feels like it was made by people who knew they had a turkey on their hands, but were too far along in the production to back out. Everyone just sort of muddles through it, waiting for the ordeal to be over. Holmes and Watson is a cringe-worthy comedy that fails on every level. The film is poorly written, poorly directed, and poorly acted. Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly are both talented comedians, but they are completely wasted in this film. The jokes are juvenile, the pacing is sluggish, and the whole thing feels like a bad Saturday Night Live skit that went on for way too long. Avoid this one at all costs."
121,MDC_Doc1_TheOtherGuys,MDC_Doc1_TheOtherGuys,MDC,Comedy,Positive,The Other Guys,"In ""The Other Guys"", Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson play Detectives Highsmith and Danson, the kind of supercops you might find in a movie like ""Lethal Weapon"" or ""Die Hard"". When the film opens, they're in medias chase through the streets of Manhattan - Danson on top of a perp's van, Highsmith in hot pursuit. It's a spectacularly over-the-top sequence resulting in millions of dollars in property damage. Of course, Highsmith and Danson get their man and win the day. But this movie isn't about them (cue a record scratch sound effect). No, ""The Other Guys"" is about the cops back at the precinct. The ones tackling the everyday cases and doing the paperwork. Y'know, the other guys. It's a cheeky concept for an action-comedy and, in the hands of director Adam McKay, it's a pretty funny one too. The duo of the title are Detectives Gamble and Hoitz, played by constant-McKay-partner Will Ferrell and trying-on-comedy-for-size Mark Wahlberg. Mr. Ferrell plays it uber-square; he's a paper-pusher from ""forensic accounting"" who's been partnered with Mr. Wahlberg's frustrated cop. It seems Hoitz was busted to desk-duty after accidentally (and hysterically) shooting Derek Jeter. Needless to say, the two are not exactly respected by their fellow officers. Mr. Wahlberg isn't exactly comfortable playing the type of broad comedy that comes so easily to Mr. Ferrell. But his discomfort actually works for the role. His Hoitz alternates between annoyed rage and annoyed desperation and, like the film itself, he hits more often than he misses. He's also surrounded by a game cast, including the ever-present Rob Riggle, and Michael Keaton (great to see him again) as the beleaguered precinct captain. The plot revolves (loosely) around a ripped-from-the-headlines Ponzi scheme involving a perfectly cast Steve Coogan. As you might expect, it runs out of steam in the end as the boys find themselves careening through the streets of Manhattan in an ever-increasing barrage of gunfire, screeching tires and helicopters. Big budgets are never the friend of action-comedies - just see ""The Last Action Hero"" if you don't believe me. Along the way the script, by Mr. McKay and Chris Henchy, keeps the pace quick and the jokes quicker. Their recipe for comedy seems to be: (1) take a typical scene from a cop movie (the funeral of a colleague, talking-a-jumper-off-a-ledge), (2) add something quirky to it (a whispered argument, a Mr. Softee truck), (3) sprinkle in a dash of ad-libbery and let simmer for only slightly longer than you'd expect. And there you have it: comedy gold! Of course, it helps to have Mr. Ferrell in fine form. He could do this character in his sleep, and he seems to enjoy having Mr. Wahlberg to play off. The humor in the film is a lot like that ending chase scene. There's a barrage of comedy bullets. Some hit the target (a running gag featuring Eva Mendes as Gamble's hot wife; Mr. Keaton's Captain inadvertently quoting the group TLC) and some don't (the backstory with"
122,MDC_Doc2_TheOtherGuys,MDC_Doc2_TheOtherGuys,MDC,Comedy,Positive,The Other Guys,"Not only do buddy cop comedies come with a major stigma, but so do both of the stars of The Other Guys, Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg. The guys are guilty of doing the same thing in just about every film, Ferrell in terms of his comedic style and Wahlberg, well, with acting in general. The Other Guys primarily stays within the subgenre mold and Ferrell and Wahlberg remain in their comfort zones, but the film has just enough freshness to it that it makes more of the same acceptable. Samuel L Jackson and Dwayne Johnson are Highsmith and Danson, New York City's top cops. They drive the hottest car, sleep with all the ladies, earn medals and cause as much destruction as possible while catching the bad guys. When their reign comes to an abrupt end, it leaves a vacancy in the city's hero department. That's where the other guys come in, Allen Gamble and Terry Hoitz (Ferrell and Wahlberg), or as the boys at the station like to call them, Paper Bitch and Yankee Clipper. Allen is always happily buried in paperwork, the trigger happy Terry is constantly losing his temper and both are notorious for screwing up. But they finally get the chance to earn some respect when they stumble upon a high profile case. The Other Guys is a slightly above average buddy comedy with somewhat smarter gags than we're used to seeing Ferrell deliver. Rather than sport an outrageous outfit like in Blades of Glory or resort to bunk bed-collapsing gags like in Step Brothers, Ferrell is blandly dressed and actually evokes more laughs with his calm demeanor. However, this is Ferrell we're talking about here and if you've seen the film's trailer you know there's some psychical and more outlandish shenanigans. But seeing Ferrell go berserk in a botched good cop, bad cop plan is far less amusing than the moments during which he drives Terry nuts by just acting normal. Terry earns his fair share of laughs in a different way, by throwing temper tantrums. It works in most cases like when he berates Allen for his music selection or when he gets himself into a silent fight, but overall, the character teeters upon being too mean spirited. He does cool off as the film goes on, but in the beginning, he's particularly harsh on Allen. Yes, Allen is far from your average cop and is a bit peculiar, but he's also far from your average buddy comedy moron and certainly doesn't deserve the hefty handful of verbal abuse from Terry. Terry's conscious effort to be nicer to his partner doesn't only earn him major points, it makes their relationship much more appealing and actually compels you to root for them. Unfortunately they can't get you on their side firmly enough because when the plot goes fuzzy at the end and their case of someone just failing to report the construction of scaffolding turns into some massive scheme to pay back a company"
123,MDC_Doc3_TheOtherGuys,MDC_Doc3_TheOtherGuys,MDC,Comedy,Positive,The Other Guys,"Will Ferrell says it himself. The words come straight out of his mouth, so there's no denying it. ""Hey, I got a weird sense of humor. I'm a sick puppy,"" admits the hapless cop he plays in The Other Guys, a Ferrellized spoof of the buddy-cop action genre. Ferrell is one of the stranger figures currently making movies. He's one of the stranger figures in the history of American film. What makes him particularly strange is his enthusiastic embrace by the mainstream - he makes huge piles of money - despite exercising a form of protracted comic absurdity that tests the boundaries of weirdness. Especially (though not exclusively) in his collaborations with director Adam McKay, Ferrell draws out his gags beyond the usual punch line toward outer limits of man-boy eccentricity. The Other Guys is a typical vehicle for Ferrell's atypical humor: It begins with an idiot, in this case New York Detective Allen Gamble (Ferrell), and moves on from there. This time the idiot has a partner, the combustible Detective Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg), best known for accidentally shooting Derek Jeter during the World Series. Allen and Terry rarely leave their desks and earn frequent abuse from their colleagues on the force, including Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson as a pair of destructively cocky hotshots. Then the hotshots suddenly exit the picture - in an hysterically outre scene that classifies, I think, as the steepest dive into surrealism ever attempted by either actor. From there, the screenplay (by McKay and Chris Henchy, a writer on Ferrell's altogether Dadaist Land of the Lost) turns to the usual business for summer cop flicks: bad guys, shootouts, chase scenes. The villains include a hulking Australian (Ray Stevenson) and a Bernie Madoff figure with soft hair (Steve Coogan), or so says Allen. Cameos follow, as do many jokes about Allen's hot wife, a hubba-hubba emergency room physician in the form of Eva Mendes. There are flashbacks to Allen's earlier career running a campus prostitution ring, sparking a duet, ""Pimps Don't Cry."" And don't forget the frozen, Matrix-style barroom tableau with drunken antics. If you want more plot, I'm sorry, but I can't supply it. It's confusingly edited and entirely beside the point, except as an excuse for long Ferrellian riffs on disparate subjects. Wahlberg pops off when required , and he offers a few blank stares of incomprehension that nicely exploit his gift for blandness. (During one of Ferrell's early monologues, a disquisition on tuna and lions, Wahlberg looks as though he's barely stifling the urge to crack up.) Through it all, Ferrell is as Ferrell does. He's a non sequitur with frizz. In The Other Guys his shtick takes on an abstracted meta quality, asking us if he's funny while he's trying to make us laugh. Sit through the end credits, and you'll find one more scene posing one more iteration of the question: Does he have a sense of humor? Well, yeah. But as Allen says, he is one sick"
124,MDC_Doc4_TheOtherGuys,MDC_Doc4_TheOtherGuys,MDC,Comedy,Positive,The Other Guys,"Allen Gamble (WILL FERRELL) and Terry Hoitz (MARK WAHLBERG) are New York desk cops who quarrel frequently as rival cops Martin (ROB RIGGLE) and Fosse (DAMON WAYANS JR.) and superstar detectives Highsmith (SAMUEL L. JACKSON) and Danson (DWAYNE ""THE ROCK"" JOHNSON) take to the streets and solve crimes. Allen prefers desk duty and paperwork, because his doting wife, Sheila (EVA MENDES), fears for his safety and he fears his aggressive, dark side will come out if he is put on the street to do real police work. Terry, meanwhile, misses the action dearly. He is saddled to a chair and a computer after accidentally shooting one of New York's top sports stars. He can't stand Allen's chipper attitude and lame '70s and '80s music. Allen, though, is gifted with numbers and accounting and stumbles on a white-collar crime ring in which he suspects a billionaire investor (STEVE COOGAN) is attempting to defraud New York's lottery system of billions of dollars in order to cover bad investments he made on behalf of a menagerie of shady groups and individuals. Terry decides to partner with him as a means of getting his rank and respect back. It's ultimately up to both cops to convince their commander, Gene Mauch (MICHAEL KEATON), to let them pursue the case, despite pressure from their police superiors. It's not easy to make a buddy cop movie in this day and age. It's almost impossible to do a serious one. So, what's left are either broad comedies a la the ""Rush Hour"" flicks or straight-up parodies like Kevin Smith's ""Cop Out"" from earlier in the year. Leave it to comedy maestros Will Ferrell and Adam McKay to breathe a little life into the genre with ""The Other Guys."" The two succeed by injecting their own foibles and silly, self-absorbed tangents into the formula. It's still basically cops and robbers, with the cops as swaggering, wise-cracking hotshots and the robbers as sneering, moustache-twirling baddies. But upon that basic structure, Ferrell and McKay hang several dozen gags -- both recurring and throwaway bits -- that give the film an energy and a comic zip lacking in the genre lately and in movie comedies, in general, this year. Ferrell stars as Allen Gamble, a Manhattan desk cop who loves doing the paperwork of other cops because it keeps him out of harm's way. Secretly, though, he is scared that his own dark side will come creeping out if faced with violent street criminals and real investigative work. That's not the case with his hotheaded squad room partner Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg), who has been saddled with desk duty ever since accidentally wounding one of New York's top sports stars. He dreams of getting back out there, cracking skulls, and doling out justice. Terry senses a way to get his detective's shield back when numbers-cruncher Allen gets wind of a possible white-collar crime ring involving a Manhattan billionaire investor (Steve Coogan), who may be defrauding the New York lottery to pay off"

""The Other Guys"" starts out as a hilarious take on cop-movie cliches, then turns into Will Ferrell's own ""Capitalism: A Love Story."" The evident ire of the movie's tax-code-dull second half suggests motives deeply personal. Maybe Will doesn't like his ranking in Forbes' current list of Hollywood's Most Overpaid Stars, which is No. 1? With his pay equal to $1 for every $3.29 his films take in, he's a sort of box-office Bernie Madoff. Ferrell teams with Mark Wahlberg, an NYPD desk jockey aching for a piece of the macho-man action owned by their supercop colleagues (Dwayne Johnson and a priceless Samuel L. Jackson). Allen (Ferrell) would rather stay put and work up a nice scaffolding-permit fine. He got into policing because he was attracted by the paperwork. ""At age 11 I audited my parents. Believe me, there were some discrepancies."" His idea of cutting loose is to cruise in his Prius while listening to the Little River Band. Wahlberg isn't a comic (why couldn't Jack Black or John C. Reilly have taken this part?), and his button-eyed scowling doesn't make him work as a straight man either. Yet there are several superb riffs in the early going, such as a couple of ""Lethal Weapon"" spoofs and a fight that breaks out at a funeral where the cops roll around belting each other on the floor - silently, so as not to be disrespectful. Some of the best gags depend on sharply executed surprise appearances including one by a top athlete and another by Eva Mendes. We learn it's possible to dance sarcastically, that a lion might have to bow in defeat to a really determined tuna, that you can become a pimp accidentally, and that true love can spring from unlikely places, such as a case of rectal poison ivy. Michael Keaton is the funniest he's been in years as a police captain who moonlights at Bed Bath & Beyond. My comedy NASDAQ was on fire. Then the movie pulled a Lehman brothers. Three and a half stars. Three. Two and a half. My God, could this thing tank all the way to two? Gags start to be repeated, and the least funny ones seem to pop up the most. ""I want to fly like a peacock,"" Wahlberg keeps saying. For some reason. The movie, directed by Adam McKay from a script he wrote with Chris Henchy, forgets it's a comedy and starts burrowing into a convoluted but uninteresting financial scandal involving an evil capitalist played by Steve Coogan. If Coogan has ever been funny in any American movie, I've missed it. Scene after scene delves into bookkeeping details. Crickets chirp. Centuries pass. Then there are slapdash car chases and shootouts. Why exactly does everyone wind up on the driving range at Chelsea Piers? And why is this funny? ""The Other Guys"" is the first disappointment"
126,MDC_Doc6_TheOtherGuys,MDC_Doc6_TheOtherGuys,MDC,Comedy,Positive,The Other Guys,"Will Ferrell's recent resume isn't anything to get excited about: Land of the Lost, Step Brothers, Semi-Pro, Blades of Glory. There's a sameness to all of them, not only in that the Ferrell characters are difficult to differentiate from one another, but that the comedy is tired and tepid. Fortunately, The Other Guys has a better grip on what's funny, exhibits solid comedic timing, and is generally more entertaining than tedious. Director Adam McKay has a stronger sense than some directors about how to best employ Ferrell's likeability and cluelessness (his two most disarming on-screen characteristics). McKay started with Ferrell on Saturday Night Live and followed him to the big screen, directing one of the actor's most consistently amusing feature endeavors, Anchorman. (Although, to be fair, he was also responsible for Step Brothers.) The underlying conceit of The Other Guys is pregnant with potential: follow the misadventures of a couple of peons who exist in the shadow of big-time action heroes. It's like a Batman movie that tracks one of Commissioner Gordon's underlings. Also, the filmmakers don't overplay their hand. Once they have milked the idea for maximum comedic value, they switch up things. As with many action-comedies, this one expends a little too much running time on narrative and the comedic momentum flags during the final half hour as the more traditional action elements heat up en route to a finale. Still, The Other Guys is funnier and more energetic than anything Ferrell has produced in quite some time. The big heroes are NYPD media hogs and daredevils Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) and Danson (Dwayne Johnson). Take the biggest action heroes from any cop movie, up the machismo and intensity tenfold (as appropriate for a parody), and you get these two, who preen like peacocks and think nothing of doing millions of dollars of damage to complete a minor drug bust. Unfortunately, they're not too bright and they think of themselves as invulnerable. When an incident corrects that misconception, someone has to step into the breach. The least likely candidates for the job are police accountant Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and his partner, Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg). Allen has no desire to go into the field but Terry, who has anger management issues, can't wait to get back. He has been deskbound since earning his nickname ""The Yankee Clipper"" after accidentally winging Derek Jeter before a game of the World Series. Allen and Terry immediately become embroiled in a big-time fraud case but the object of their investigation, David Ershon (Steve Coogan), is so well-connected that their captain, ex-baseball manager Gene Mauch (Michael Keaton), tries to reel them in. Meanwhile, in true buddy film fashion, the mismatched partners begin to bond, although Terry cannot believe a square like Allen is married to a gorgeous woman like Dr. Sheila Gamble (Eva Mendes). The film's first 15 minutes are by far the most fun (and could be the best quarter-hour of any movie released this year), with Samuel L. Jackson and"
127,MDC_Doc7_TheOtherGuys,MDC_Doc7_TheOtherGuys,MDC,Comedy,Negative,The Other Guys,"While Will Ferrell was off playing with dinosaurs, Zach Galifianakis became the funniest man in America. Or if it's not Galifianakis, it's Tracy Morgan, or Seth Rogen, or Jon Stewart, or Stephen Colbert, all of whom now have more cultural cachet than the guy with the many leather-bound books. It's not that Ferrell has gotten less funny-it's that no amount of comedy genius could salvage the miserably scripted Semi-Pro and Land of the Lost. In Ferrell's defense, those recent stinkers didn't feature his yang-former Saturday Night Live head writer (and Ferrell's Funny or Die co-conspirator) Adam McKay, who wrote and directed Anchorman, Talladega Nights, and Step Brothers. The minds behind ""I like to think of Jesus as a mischievous badger"" have reunited for the buddy-cop comedy The Other Guys (Columbia). Has Ferrell made a triumphant return? Not really. Despite the occasional dose of McFerrellian ridiculousness, The Other Guys never hits the peaks of the duo's previous collaborations-there's just a bit too much formula and not quite enough insane-asylum lunacy. The Other Guys actually suffers by comparison to its own madcap opening sequence. The Rock and Samuel L. Jackson storm through the first two scenes as Danson and Highsmith, a pair of sexually voracious, trigger-happy lawmen who blow up the Trump Tower to catch a perp and party with Brody Jenner, Bai Ling, and that ""little short bitch from Jersey Shore."" The Other Guys quickly, and very funnily, kills off the hero cops, shifting our focus to the movie's bumbling protagonists, the straight-laced, oversize-glasses-wearing, Little River Band-loving Gamble (Ferrell) and the violence-prone loose cannon Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg). When you pull that switcheroo, the heroes you shove into the spotlight better be more interesting than the ones you dangle in front of us and then yank away. To see how it's done, watch Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle. The Other Guys, by contrast, shows what happens when a movie is too willing to trade its vitality for a big early laugh. Left alone, Ferrell and Wahlberg struggle with the constraints of a well-worn genre. What happens when a mild-mannered accountant and an insult-heaving hothead try to put the screws to a rapacious, scheming capitalist (Steve Coogan)? Pretty much what you'd expect, including the car chases. With The Other Guys' comedy kingpin under wraps as a strait-laced ""paper bitch,"" McKay et al. needed to give the less yuk-inducing Wahlberg the gift of better lines. But Wahlberg doesn't say anything memorable the entire movie, perhaps on account of the movie's PG-13 rating-his tough-talking cop in The Departed was a lot more fun to watch, thanks to the 50 different ways he had to say Go fuck yourself. By the time Ferrell sheds his tie and gets manic, the movie's formula has gotten a little too stale to salvage. In fairness to McKay and Ferrell, their movies are properly evaluated less as coherent narratives than as sequences of quotable nuggets. Even so, The Other Guys has too few quotable moments-I'm partial to Ferrell's"
128,MDC_Doc8_TheOtherGuys,MDC_Doc8_TheOtherGuys,MDC,Comedy,Negative,The Other Guys,"The sidesplitting excellence of Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby's sly red state-blue state commentary was that it flowed effortlessly from its characters, settings, and situations. Not so, disappointingly, with The Other Guys, which randomly tacks onto its buddy-cop formula a graceless, out-of-place critique of institutionalized financial corruption that culminates, in a stunning bit of activist didacticism, with a credit sequence of banking-corruption facts set to the lyrical stylings of overbearing wannabe social-justice poster boy Zach de la Rocha. Given that this is a film from Adam McKay and Will Ferrell, a partnership that's so far produced three exemplary Dadaist comedies-of-insanity, one's prone to take such earnest hot-button concerns as another of their many out-of-leftfield pranks. Yet the ways in which McKay's latest addresses its larger Wall St.-centric interests are so clumsy, ill-fitting, and, most disastrous of all, unfunny that the material's topical undercurrents ultimately prove a grave misstep into soapbox preaching. And it's a shift relative to his prior work that's all the more stunning for taking place in a story that otherwise often exhibits his and Ferrell's trademark arbitrary absurdity. While it assumes a cliched mismatched-cop comedy template, The Other Guys isn't simply a straight Cop Out-style parody, a merciful development considering that the genre's satiric potential has now been just about fully exhausted. Nonetheless, conventions are regularly tweaked at the outset, as paperwork-loving desk jockey Allen (Ferrell) contends with his angry partner Terry (Mark Wahlberg)-whose promising career was derailed when he accidentally shot Derek Jeter-and two renegade NYC cops (Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson) who are showered with praise and glory for their over-the-top Dirty Harry tactics. When the beloved officers die in the line of duty, via an inspired bit in which they pursue baddies by jumping off a high-rise's roof (""Aim for the bushes"") to their concrete sidewalk demise, an opportunity arises for Allen and Terry to step up and become the precinct's top dogs. But conflict arises out of Allen's unwillingness and inability to be a ""real cop"" and Terry's frustration at these circumstances, a dynamic rooted in Allen's lack of manliness that's never exploited for anything more than stale frat-guy insults about Allen using a tampon and driving a sissy Prius. Investigating scaffolding violations leads the duo to a renowned investor (Steve Coogan) who, it turns out, is planning an illicit scheme to pay back the billions he owes various livid clients, a central thread so inelegantly scripted and inconsequential that every mention of it grinds the proceedings to a standstill. It's a shortcoming that becomes more pressing as The Other Guys wends its way to the third act, since the film's censure of domestic capitalistic practices (replete with references to AIG, Bernie Madoff, and SEC incompetence) are all tied to the basic, tedious crime plot. McKay and Ferrell are at their best when throwing literalness out the window, and accordingly the strongest moments are those that adhere to illogicality, as when Allen introduces the smoking-hot Eva Mendes as his wife"
129,MDC_Doc9_TheOtherGuys,MDC_Doc9_TheOtherGuys,MDC,Comedy,Negative,The Other Guys,"10 years after The Other Guys, a lot has changed for its principal actors and director. Will Ferrell is still headlining comedies, but modern Ferrell vehicles like Holmes & Watson haven't been anywhere near as beloved as Anchorman. Mark Wahlberg, meanwhile, almost exclusively does Peter Berg action movies aimed at baby boomers. As for director Adam McKay, he's now helming award season dramas venting rage at 2000s-era politics (The Big Short, Vice) with famous people explaining basic socio-political concepts to the camera. Ferrell, Wahlberg, and McKay are all on very different paths in 2020. But for one moment in August 2010, their paths all crossed with McKay's action comedy, The Other Guys. Though it's a buddy cop movie, The Other Guys is not about the kind of badasses you usually see headlining this kind of fare. We meet those kinds of characters in a prologue in the form of Detectives Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson) and Danson (Dwayne Johnson). Highsmith and Danson are cool: They crash cars, they catch bad guys, they make snarky quips while in high-speed pursuits. The actual protagonists of The Other Guys are far less glamorous. Though Allen Gamble (Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Wahlberg) are police detectives, they rarely leave their desks. They spend their days typing away on computers, toiling away for NYPD's accounting department. This suits mild-mannered Gamble fine, but Hoitz is a hothead who wants the chance to redeem himself as an officer (especially after an incident in which he shot Derek Jeter in the foot). Hoitz gets his chance when Gamble stumbles upon a conspiracy involving billionaire Sir David Ershon (Steve Coogan), which starts as a seemingly routine scaffolding permit violation but leads Gamble and Hoitz to discover a much larger plot involving money laundering, securities fraud, and Chechen mercenaries. Now the other guys are the ones tackling this Wall Street subterfuge. As recent films like Ready or Not and Knives Out have shown, the rich make for great baddies in genre fare. They're immediately unlikeable for hoarding money when so many don't have anything, while letting audiences live vicariously through protagonists who challenge the largesse of the wealthy. The Other Guys was released a mere two years after the 2008 recession and after Bernie Madoff was sent to prison for his Ponzi scheme, which bilked nearly $64.8 million from working people. The searing realization of what rich white people can get away with was fresh on the mind of both McKay and the audience. Meanwhile, the entire concept of centering the film around ordinary people (""the other guys"") is meant to provide a voice to the type of people upended by the financial crisis. All of the folks who actually lost money in 2008 or in the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme before that or any other financial crisis? They're represented by Hoitz and Gamble, two everyday people who drive around in a Prius. This coding of helpful figures as scrappier, financially-challenged people even extends to supporting characters. Take Captain Gene Mauch (Michael"
130,MDC_Doc10_TheOtherGuys,MDC_Doc10_TheOtherGuys,MDC,Comedy,Negative,The Other Guys,"FOR any lover of movie comedy, a film in which Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg play two New York cops, both losers, presents a challenge. Ferrell is almost a guarantee of the infantile TV sketch humour that works sporadically, depending on your taste for silliness. He may be the funniest thing in his movies, but they are usually such bad movies that it's a chore to find the giggles (Step Brothers and Land of the Lost, anyone?). Wahlberg is just a magnet for bad scripts, despite his talent. The Departed was great; not so much Max Payne. He was funny in a supporting role in Date Night, but this is his first leading role in a comedy. And he is in the hands of Adam McKay, who has helped Ferrell make some of his worst and best (Step Brothers, Anchorman). It could go either way. The title refers to the fact that detectives Gamble (Ferrell) and Hoitz (Wahlberg) are overshadowed in their department by two rock star celebrity cops, played by Dwayne Johnson (no sign of ''The Rock'' in his name these days) and Samuel L. Jackson. These guys do car chases, destroy buildings, kill bad guys and get on the news, all while wearing sunglasses. Their long-suffering boss, Captain Mauch (Michael Keaton), keeps Gamble and Hoitz in the office, doing paperwork for the supercops. Gamble and Hoitz are ''the other guys'', the schlubs everyone teases. Gamble likes his desk, since he is an accountant - albeit a ''forensic accountant''. Hoitz thinks of himself as a tough-guy street cop. He is always yelling at Gamble, who sits opposite. Basically, he is a satirical version of the characters Wahlberg plays - pissed off and looking for someone to shoot. Personally, I liked the other guys. In a movie with Keaton and Jackson, not to mention Eva Mendes, Anne Heche and Steve Coogan in support roles, I kept searching the backgrounds rather than the foregrounds. While Wahlberg was throwing his computer on the office floor, challenging Ferrell to grow some testicles, I was hoping Keaton would join the scene, to help them both be funnier. Alas, the other guys dominate The Other Guys, and they're true to recent form. One shouts, the other annoys. There are moments when I could see what the movie might have been, but it misses by a long yard, primarily because the reality of any situation always gives way to a gag. This is a rule of sketch comedy, where the scene is all that matters, not the whole show. Two guys riffing off each other on Saturday Night Live can be funny for a few minutes, then it's on to two other guys or girls. In a movie, the reality of characters and story has to take precedence, or it did before modern comedians joined forces with computer games and short attention spans to unmake the rules of the first century of movie comedy. The Other Guys has a story arc - the losers take on"
131,CDK_Doc1_LostCity,CDK_Doc1_LostCity,CDK,Comedy,Negative,Lost City,"If you don't have a few hours to watch the cheerfully dumb comedy (The Lost City,) just stare at the poster. Almost everything you need to know about this nonsensical lark is crammed into the one sheet: the stars, the tropical location, the Bruckheimer-esque fireball. The poster is selling sex and violence and obvious laughs, with Sandra Bullock's sequined purple onesie doing the heavy comic lifting. And while she and Channing Tatum are the headliners, the studio has hedged its bets by also cramming in a leering goat and a Fabio-ed Brad Pitt. The goat and Pitt are among the high points of the movie, a high-concept romp about a widowed writer, Loretta Sage (Bullock), making a tortuous re-entrance into the world. A successful romance novelist, Loretta writes books featuring a hunky dreamboat and throbbing verbs. For strained reasons, she is kidnapped while on a promo tour with the cover model for her books, Alan (Tatum). He tries to rescue her and soon they're joking through a jungle adventure featuring a lost treasure, and a deranged rich villain (Daniel Radcliffe) and his minions. Bullets and jokes fly, not always hitting their targets. That's more or less the movie, which is basically a vehicle for Bullock to play her most enduring role: Sandra Bullock, your supremely likable BFF. Genuine yet packaged, challenged but unsinkable, the Bullock BFF has been a mainstay for decades. She's endured rough patches, as in (Speed 2,) but has always bounced back, buoyed by a shrewdly deployed, indomitable persona that's wholesome, sardonic and goofy, though not (usually) insultingly so. Although she can handle a range of genres, she excels at comedy partly because she can play off a wide range of performers: Like all BFFs, she makes a generous double act. That said, it takes a while for Bullock and Tatum to find their groove, in part because he isn't as comfortable in his lunkhead role as he needs to be. He's playing a conventional sweet dope, a cliche role he handles fluidly when in Alan's exaggerated cover-model drag, complete with flowing hair and peekaboo waxed chest. But he is less facile when his character comes off as impossibly stupid, moments he plays by affecting a bit of a Mark Wahlberg whiny singsong. Is it homage, coincidence - who knows? Whatever the case, Tatum seems happier when his character fares better too, allowing him and Bullock to settle into a breezy intimacy. For the most part, (The Lost City) delivers exactly what it promises: A couple of highly polished avatars quipping and hitting their marks while occasionally being upstaged by their second bananas (Da'Vine Joy Randolph included). There are some accommodations to contemporary mores. Tatum bares more skin than Bullock does, flashing his sculpted hindquarters in a scene that, like the movie overall, isn't as sharp or as funny as it should be. But while Loretta isn't as helpless as she might have been back in the old studio days, this is still about a man rescuing"
132,CDK_Doc2_LostCity,CDK_Doc2_LostCity,CDK,Comedy,Negative,Lost City,"(The Lost City) is a big mess - a big enough mess that it doesn't even get credit forknowingit's a mess - but it stars Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum, so that helps. It doesn't make it worth seeing, but it keeps the experience outside the realm of pain. Yet in one way the casting actually hurts: When actors who are really, really good at comedy apply themselves to dialogue that is really, really weak, you feel the strain. You feel the outline of the joke that wasn't there - and the vicarious embarrassment of a failed acrobatic turn that goes splat. String enough splat moments together, and you have a movie that could have been good, but isn't. The setup is fine. Bullock is Loretta, a romance novelist who has become reclusive since her husband's death. On a tour for her latest book, one she doesn't even like, she is paired with Alan (Tatum), a model who has appeared on the cover of all the books in her celebrated series. At this point, the Fabio-like model has more fans than Loretta, and Tatum is funny, tossing his (wigged) longblond hair and preening for his fans. One gets the sense that if the story just found a way to staythere, on that tour, the movie would have found its way to something enjoyable. But then the plot kicks in. A spoiled and somewhat demented young scion of the Fairfax media empire (Daniel Radcliffe) - these days, every evil character is a fictional rendition of someone from the Murdoch family - approaches Loretta with a proposition. Because of her knowledge of ancient languages, he wants her help finding the buried treasure of some lost civilization. That's a reasonable offer. He needs help translating clues to the treasure, and he's willing to pay her anything she asks. But she says no, so he kidnaps her and brings her to the island anyway. It would be missing the point of a movie like this to quibble too much about illogical turns of plot. But even in a goofy confection like (The Lost City,) it's hard not to notice when characters consistently behave against their own best interests, seemingly to help the screenwriters perpetuate the story. Over and over - I'd describe this in detail, but it wouldn't be worth reading - the characters are shoehorned into actions that don't make sense and that undercut both the story and the comedy. The movie has two bright spots. Brad Pitt makes a brief appearance as the man who can get them off the island. Bullock asks him how he happened to become so handsome and he answers, (My father was a weatherman.) Bullock and Tatum also have a funny moment, right after they accidentally force two bad guys on motorcycles to go off a cliff. In what plays like an ad lib, the two start finishing each other's sentences, talking guiltily about how they didn't really mean for that to happen. It's a moment that"

The movie, released in theaters on March 25, offers nothing unique. In fact, you get the sensation that you've already watched it a million times. It's the typical adventure movie where the two main characters fall in love after fighting for their lives in the wilderness.From the beginning, it was obvious thatThe Lost Citywould not be a revolutionary or award-winning movie, but it doesn't even get any redeeming points for being funny. The audience forgets the few moments worthy of laughter because they are overshadowed by the painfully unfunny scenes throughout the entire movie.Bullock plays Loretta, a recently widowed, burnt-out romance novelist and former archaeologist. She is sinking in grief, unable to form connections with the people around her or to carry on with her career as an author. In an effort to sell her book of the same title as the movie, Loretta's marketing team advises her to appeal to a young audience. This young audience is a superficial fanbase that's more interested in Alan (Tatum), the sexy man on the cover of her book who plays the hero of her novel, than the actual content of her work. Loretta is well-spoken and knowledgeable in archaeology, but she is frustrated because her readers dismiss these traits. Her frustrations led her to become arrogant and ungrateful both to her fanbase and to the viewer. She thinks very little of Alan, believing he is shallow and vain because he is confident and attracts lots of women. But Alan's character is charming beyond his physical attractiveness. His character surprises the viewer by demonstrating depth and complexity after his first seemingly shallow appearance in the movie. Although Alan fits the archetype of a himbo at first, he is much more than that. He is caring, thoughtful, and in touch with his emotions. Loretta, on the other hand, puts little effort into the things she does and says and goes along with anything her marketing team says, showing her lack of personality and ambition. During her book tour, Loretta is kidnapped by Abigail (Daniel Radcliffe), a bizarre, wealthy man. The movie turns into a rescue mission that Alan orchestrates to find Loretta.The plot is disorganized and sloppy. It includes a few poorly executed action and fight scenes that are predictable for the genre and therefore uninteresting.The brief appearance of Brad Pitt as Jack Trainer shows the directors' dependency on a renowned cast to make a noticeable movie. Pitt appears out of nowhere to fight the bad guys in the movie and does not add much more than that. The Lost Citycould've been funny if it wasn't trying so desperately hard. When it tries to be funny through sarcasm, it overdoes the sarcasm to an obvious and awkward point.In the opening scene of the book, the protagonists of Loretta's romance novel are held hostage"
134,CDK_Doc4_LostCity,CDK_Doc4_LostCity,CDK,Comedy,Negative,Lost City,"What more could one ask for in 2022-with the film industry in such precarious turmoil, with so much adventure put on hold while spiral bands of disease sweep across the globe-than a big Hollywood spectacular in which two movie stars go to a far flung locale for a dangerous, sexy escapade? That is the great promise ofThe Lost City(in theaters March 25), which featuresSandra Bullockas a frustrated, but successful, romance novelist andChanning Tatumas the dreamboat who has posed for all of her steamy book covers. What a gas! The Lost Cityhas a funny shape to it. On the one hand, its programmatic setup-familiar to fans ofRomancing the Stoneor (to a lesser extent)Raiders of the Lost Ark-feels easy, like it's built on fast rails. Yet in that assumption of ease lies a difficulty. An airy star vehicle like this takes a lot of work, but shouldn't look like it does. Unfortunately,The Lost City(directed byAdamandAaron Nee) seems exhausted by its task from the outset.Bullock plays Loretta, who is struggling to finish the latest book in her hot-and-throbbing romance-adventure series, gloomy from the loss of her husband and sour about the state of her work. She's an intellect who should be off making great discoveries with her archeologist husband, not stuck pandering to the middling American masses. Bullock is good at such prickly discomfort, but a little of it goes a long way. InThe Lost City, though, she's asked to maintain that dyspepsia for nearly the entire run of the film. It's a single, relentlessly repeated note that weighs down a film that should bounce, not trudge. (At least Bullock's high aptitude for physical comedy is put to good, if too brief, use.) Perhaps the calculation was that Tatum, as dopey Alan, would add the goofiness and levity necessary to offset Bullock's peevishness. He tries to do that, and he and Bullock's chemistry does sometimes sparkle and fizz enough to keep the movie afloat. But we've also seen this shtick from Tatum perhaps too many times before: the hunk who's actually a guileless sweetheart, a dork in himbo packaging. His decency is so immediately telegraphed in the film that there's no room for the happy surprise of a character turn. What could rescue, or at least brighten up, these uninspired performances is a remotely engaging story. ButThe Lost Cityflounders in that arena as well. The gist is that something Loretta wrote in her newest novel accidentally syncs up with an I.R.L. search for a lost bauble of old, rumored to be buried somewhere on a remote island in the Atlantic. (I think its closest real-world analog would be a distant Canary Island.)Daniel Radcliffegamely plays the jilted son of a Murdoch-esque media empire who has become obsessed with finding this object of myth. So obsessed, in fact, that he's willing to kidnap Loretta to help in his search. Alan goes bumbling after Loretta in an attempt to prove that he can live up to the derring-do of the man he plays on book covers."

The glittery, spangly, skintight, plunging-neckline, raspberry-colored jumpsuit Sandra Bullock sports throughout much of the loud and unfunny and flat and derivative (Romancing the Stone) knockoff (The Lost City,) as if she's wandered in from a mediocre 1980s sitcom. Bullock's Loretta Sage is wedged into that ridiculously constrictive garment as she tries to mount a barstool-type seat onstage, as she's kidnapped, as she attempts to escape her captors, as she stumbles through the jungle, etc., etc., etc.? Isn't that HILARIOUS? Eh. Maybe for some. Comedy is comedy and if you find this sort of light and dopey material humorous, have at it. Nothing wrong with an iced venti non-fat frothy drink of forgettable escapism. (The Lost City) is completely harmless as it attempts to revisit past-generation romantic comedy/action adventures such as the aforementioned (Stone,) (Six Days, Seven Nights,) (King Solomon's Mines,) (The Mummy) and of course (Raiders of the Lost Ark,) but it's so cartoonishly over the top that it bears no resemblance to anything that could ever happen in the real world. Despite the game efforts of the star-studded cast, the dialogue often crash-lands with a resounding thud, the action sequences are muddled and rote, and it hedges its bets to the point that one of the best bits in the movie-one of the few times the scriptwriters do something fresh and original-is completely undercut by a mid-credits sequence, as if the filmmakers didn't want to see that one fabulously dark moment all the way through, lest anyone accuse them of even trying to be edgy. In the maudlin setup for (The Lost City,) we learn Bullock's Loretta, a romance novelist with a serious background in history and dead languages, has been wallowing in a self-loathing, deep funk for some five years, ever since the death of her archaeologist husband. Loretta is sleepwalking through life and hates her career, as she considers her work to be trash and views her legions of fans with condescension. Grumbling and protesting every step of the way, Loretta has been talked into squeezing herself into that garish jumpsuit (we're told that's the style these days for book tours, or some such nonsense) at the urging of her publicist, Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), who has also hired a social media manager named Pratt Caprison (the wonderful Patti Harrison, wasted), who Insta-Tik-Toks-Whatevers every moment, capping off her comments with (Hashtag Shawn Mendes,) cuz, you know, the kids. Loretta takes the stage with her longtime be-wigged, dimwitted and Fabio-like cover model Dash-real name Alan (Channing Tatum)-who makes his entrance to the sounds of the bombastic stadium rocker (The Final Countdown,) and I guess we're supposed to take that as an homage to Will Arnett as Gob already mining that particular routine to perfection in (Arrested Development)? Anyway. Things go horribly wrong, Loretta storms out-and she's kidnapped by henchmen working for Daniel Radcliffe's Abigail Fairfax ((It's gender neutral!) he howls), the sweaty, weak-willed, billionaire oddball son of a world-famous media mogul. Abigail has"

The archeology subplot is a clever set up for the fish out water shenanigans. The film runs about twenty minutes long butkeeps the laughs flowingconsistently. Sandra Bullock stars as Loretta Sage, a best-selling romance novelist who's been hiding from the outside world for five years. She continues to grieve after the death of her beloved archeologist husband. Loretta's publisher, Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), forces her out of seclusion to start a book tour. Loretta dreads public appearances. Especially when all the lusty fans come to see Alan (Channing Tatum), the chiseled male model who portrays Dash, her fictional gallant hero, on the book covers. Their first event turns out to be the disaster Loretta expected. Alan does his best to impress her but always comes off as an imbecile. Thesituation gets worsewhen Loretta is kidnapped by Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe), a slighted media mogul. He's looking for the mythical Crown of Fire and thinks Loretta can decipher a clue to its remote island location. Alan springs into action to rescue Loretta. He contracts an elite soldier (Brad Pitt) for the job. But wants to tag along and prove his worth to Loretta. Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatumelevate the scriptwith talent. Loretta can't believe what's happening to her. And gets more frustrated by Alan's spectacular bungling. He tries his best to emulate Dash's heroics but falls short. Alan's a sweet guy that's tired of being ridiculed for his shirtless modeling. His noble efforts bring Loretta out of her shell. She's a capable woman who needed a nudge forward. Their scenes together in the jungle will have audiences howling with laughter.The supporting cast holds their comedic own with the leads. Brad Pitt almost steals the show with a sliver of screen time. He's Dash personified and that completely emasculates Alan. Channing Tatum, who normally plays the good-looking savior, trips over himself as the goofy sidekick. Daniel Radcliffe also gets big laughs as the antagonist. He clearly relishes a role that his legion of Harry Potter fans would never expect. Radcliffe is akin to a rom-com Bond villain with a bruised ego. He's such a versatile actor. The Lost Citydoes not take itself seriously. It is an escapist film with a lot of physical humor. The script counts on the ensemble cast to shore up the plot with pratfalls and sight gags. There's a running joke about Loretta's purple-sequined jumpsuit. It's a plot device designed to be used throughout as an easy source of chuckles. I thought these scenes were good fun. They allow the cast to improvise but can see where some may find them silly. The Lost Cityis a check our brain at the door experience. The film reminded me of the Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas eighties classic, Romancing the Stone. It's light, fluffy,"
137,CDK_Doc7_LostCity,CDK_Doc7_LostCity,CDK,Comedy,Positive,Lost City,"'The Lost City' accompanies popular romantic-adventure novelist Loretta Sage (Bullock) who enjoys a quiet life, keeping the extravagant adventures part of her books and not her reality. But when Loretta is kidnapped by an eccentric billionaire (Radcliffe) who believes parts of her latest novel can help him find a treasure believed to be lost forever she finds herself thrust into a terrifying situation she never expected to experience firsthand. When Alan (Tatum) the dashing cover model for her books decides to come rescue her, the two promptly find themselves fighting through unknown terrain and trying to stay alive while pursued by dangerous men with guns intent on bringing her back. Whether she wanted it or not, it looks like Loretta will be forced to actually live an adventure terrifyingly similar to those she writes, only with far less talent and experience between her and Alan than those of her fictional characters. Directed by Adam Nee and Aaron Nee (Band of Robbers) from a screenplay that they additionally co-wrote along with Oren Uziel (22 Jump Street) and Dana Fox (Cruella), and from a story by Seth Gordon, Adam and Aaron Nee do a great job at the helm of 'The Lost City' capably guiding along the fun with style and utilizing the beautiful surroundings to keep it looking magnificent at the same time. The film's cast includes Sandra Bullock (The Heat), Channing Tatum (Logan Lucky), Daniel Radcliffe (Swiss Army Man), Da'Vine Joy Randolph (TV's Only Murders in the Building) and Brad Pitt (Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood) along with more and nearly all providing solid and fitting performances for the most part in each of their respective roles and helping this one to work so smoothly. 'The Lost City' is a clever and swiftly paced adventure comedy that delivers plenty of amusing and well-constructed action that's complemented by a plethora of laughs and silly fun. Add to that a beautiful location for all of the fun and chaos to play out, plus a dream cast pairing in Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum who strike comedy gold together and bounce off of each other better than many of us would have ever expected. Plus of course a truly hilarious Brad Pitt in a smaller role who effortlessly steals every moment he occupies, and Daniel Radcliffe as a wealthy man with a mission and a mean streak that comes off as amusing as he is threatening. It all comes together remarkably well to form a fun, exciting and quite hilarious adventure comedy very reminiscent of some great similar titles of decades prior that delivers nicely in almost every way without ever trying to become something unnecessarily thought-provoking or complex. I would definitely urge everyone who hasn't yet had the pleasure of 'The Lost City' to try and find the time to give it a shot whenever possible. It's a fun, funny and fast-paced adventure that pays homage to many similar films of previous decades with a stellar combination of talent to keep"
138,CDK_Doc8_LostCity,CDK_Doc8_LostCity,CDK,Comedy,Positive,Lost City,"Death cannot stop true love; it can only delay it for a while. Or soThe Princess Bridetaught us. Sure enough, the much bally-hooed death of the big-screen romcom is beginning to look more like a hiatus, because here we are in 2022 with a crowd-pleasing, star-led romance in an exotic location. If much of directors Adam and Aaron Nee's plot feels like a throwback to an earlier era, and in particular toRomancing The Stone, the humour here is entirely up-to-date and immensely fun. The familiar bits first:Sandra Bullocksteps intoKathleen Turner's shoes as a successful romance novelist whose personal life is a mess. But unlike Joan Wilder, Bullock's Loretta is grieving a lost husband, and seems irritable at the success of her own books. In place ofMichael Douglas' tough jungle guide we haveChanning Tatum's gentle cover model Alan, who's nursing both a crush on and a grudge against Loretta, the latter for her refusal to take her own books seriously. However, when she's kidnapped by a media billionaire's son, Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe), Alan swings ineffectually into action, and soon our two heroes are lost in the jungle of a small island, bickering and perhaps bonding as they try to find safety. None of this is particularly new, of course. Bullock has played the wary, uptight over-achiever before; Tatum's given us previous variations on witless-yet-beautiful; even a bit with leeches has been done before. But the film finds nuance to season the archetypes. There's more than lip service paid to Loretta's grief and her dashed dreams of serious scholarship, and while she's not immune to Alan's looks, you can see why he wouldn't be on her radar. Tatum, meanwhile, gamely plays the bimbo role, but manages to inject just enough edge to suggest that Alan's brain is merely underutilised and not entirely absent. With the stars carrying the film along, the Nees can add emotion and humour in the detail. They mine laughs from Alan's phone contacts and Fairfax's cheese board, while costume designer Marlene Stewart puts Bullock in a fuschia-coloured sequinned jumpsuit that plays well against the otherwise standard jungle aesthetics.Brad Pitt's hyper-capable survival trainer, Jack Trainer, is an awe-inspiring embodiment of the romance novel archetype who threatens even the usually laid-back Alan, while Da'Vine Joy Randolph does a lot with very little as Loretta's editor. Radcliffe even comes close to saying something true about the entitlement and self-righteousness of the super-wealthy as a black-sheep billionaire. Really, though, you have towantto find deeper meanings here. This movie is like its star's jumpsuit: sparkly, gorgeous and entirely frivolous. It coasts by on charisma and comedic talent, on dancing and daring, on stunning locations (the Dominican jungle) and stakes that are high enough to hold the attention and not a millimetre higher. You will predict almost every beat before it arrives and welcome its arrival anyway, because the formula works. The romcom is dead; long live the romcom. Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum make a sweet and spiky couple in this likeable"
139,CDK_Doc9_LostCity,CDK_Doc9_LostCity,CDK,Comedy,Positive,Lost City,"After the death of her husband, the last thing smartypants archaeologist-turned-paperback-romance-author Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) wants to do is leave her house, let alone go on a book tour at the behest of her caring but pushy publisher/publicist Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) and painfully millennial social media manager Allison (Patti Harrison, a star). Being a trouper, Loretta suits up into her uncomfortable glittery purple jumpsuit (it's on loan) and begrudgingly puts on a fake smile onstage next to Alan (Channing Tatum), the well-meaning but dimwitted (and yes, hot) himbo cover model who portrays the hunky leading man of Loretta's books, Dash McMahon. As if leaving her house in the first place weren't bad enough, Loretta is mysteriously kidnapped by Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe), the psychotic child of a billionaire media mogul locked in aSuccession-like feud with his more successful siblings. Somehow, it gets even more twisted: Abigail is hellbent on discovering the (Crown of Fire) in the middle of a remote Atlantic island, and believes Loretta is the only one who can decipher the treasure map. Secretly in love with her, Alan hops on a plane and enlists the help of Jack Trainer (Brad Pitt) to rescue Loretta from Abigail's monied clutches, deep within the jungle. While the explosive, action-packed sequences are a lot of fun, and an essential element of the adventure genre, what setsThe Lost Cityapart from recent, more tired blockbuster adventure/comedy fare (looking at you,Uncharted) is the humorously human moments that lead to a genuine connection between Loretta, Alan and the audience. Instead of falling back on the kind of semi-ironic (so, that happened) style of fourth-wall-breaking writing, directors and co-writers Adam and Aaron Nee take familiar adventure/rom-com cornerstones and repurpose them to find previously undiscovered gems through these personal moments. They are certainly aware of the tropes being toyed with here-dumb guy/smart lady romance, the frame story of Loretta's novels, the treasure-hunting villian-but they approach these tropes with a freshness that gets the audience invested in its characters. The choice to play Alan as a loveable dummy with a surprising amount of tender insight is much more interesting than the usual emotionally repressed macho action hero, or a sarcastic know-it-all rolling his eyes and winking at the audience. Not only is it funny watching Alan fumble his way through the jungle, it's also endearing when he reveals himself to be more than what Loretta sees on the surface. What Alan lacks in street smarts, he makes up for in emotional intelligence and a gentle spirit; Tatum isn't afraid to play that for laughs, either. (Don't judge a book by its cover model,) he tells Loretta by the fire. This adage also applies to audience perceptions of the film overall: Don't be too quick to turn your nose up atThe Lost Citybecause of its blockbuster gloss and trite trailer, for so many treasures await beneath the surface. One ofThe Lost City's greatest strengths is its lack of previous IP to anchor it to any fan service expectations"
140,CDK_Doc10_LostCity,CDK_Doc10_LostCity,CDK,Comedy,Positive,Lost City,"Directed by Adam Nee and Aaron Nee from a screenplay they co-wrote with Oren Uziel and Dana Fox,The Lost Cityfeels like a film from the past (in a good way). The film doesn't set out to do anything different, settling into the comforts certain tropes and story beats provide. However, that doesn't makeThe Lost Cityany less fun than it aims to be. With the effortlessly charming and talented cast doing most of the heavy lifting,The Lost Citymakes for a highly entertaining, joyful adventure. The Lost Cityfollows best-selling romance author Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock), a widow who is trying her best to finish her latest book in time for a book tour her manager, Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), put together. Loretta isn't feeling it, though, especially when she realizes Alan (Channing Tatum), a model whoportrays Dash, Loretta's character, on the cover of all of her books, will be at the events. All Alan wants to do is please Loretta, but allthe recluse wants to do is to go back home. However, her life takes an adventurous turn when she's kidnapped by billionaire Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe), who believes the Lost City of D the author wrote about - as well as the tomb containing a treasure he's seeking - is real. Enter Alan who, despite not knowing at all what he's doing, endeavors to go save her. The Lost Cityhas a lot going for it: a charming cast, genuinely funny moments, and some adrenaline-fueled adventure. The film harkens back to the days when such romcom adventures were more of a constant. Bullock and Tatum have the bickering down, but when things slow down between them, they're able to understand each other a lot better than before. As a team, they work well and they're the highlight of the film overall, with their comedic timing being especially worth noting. Tatum really delivers as a man who's got his heart in the right place, even when he isn't the most intelligent of people. His rapport with bothBullock and Brad Pitt- whose role as Jack Trainer is smaller than the trailers would have one believe - is fantastic. The frustrated energy Bullock puts out isfabulous and the physical humor employed by Tatum underlines his comedic abilities well. If anything,The Lost Citycould have used a lot more heat between Bullock and Tatum, with only a couple of scenes making good use of their chemistry before the film moves on too quickly to the next thing. That said, the film is well-paced and, at one point, even surprising. Not all the humor lands, but it is so full with comedic moments that the audience will find themselves laughing more often than not at the antics and reactions of the characters. Tatum's Alan, who has zero combat skills, takes to slapping Fairfax's henchmen when they attack and it's incredibly amusing to watch. Mostly,The Lost Cityis buoyed by Bullock and Tatum's charisma, of which they have plenty. Radcliffe's turn as the villain of the story really works, though"
141,RDH_Doc1_NoTimeToDie,RDH_Doc1_NoTimeToDie,RDH,Action,Negative,No time to Die,"Let the mourning begin. In No Time to Die, James Bond is dead after 25 installments of the popular series about England's most glamorous secret agent-which means he will never be back-in his present form. This is also Daniel Craig's fifth and final appearance as 007, so enjoy his previously indestructible stoicism for the last time, too. Do this, I hasten to add, only if you are forever dedicated to a fictional action hero who, in your heart of hearts, can do no wrong. In my opinion, he ran out of steam long ago, and now in retirement from Her Majesty's Secret Service, he has no charm, no wit, no sex appeal, no fatal allure for women and he's losing his hair. He dies from stray bullets, deja vu, stale dialogue and mixed reviews. The car chases, the fight sequences (there are two), the helicopter shots, the never-ending guns and exploding warheads have all been done before. This is probably to be expected. You don't go to a James Bond movie to learn anything new. You go to ogle the latest girls, gadgets and exotic locations. The entertainment values are ever apparent, the violence and bloodshed have a certain lift that both defines and defies imagination, and who would have it any other way? You don't always remember what you saw the next day, but you know you had some fun. This time the excitement fades like the popcorn that went with it, and for me, ennui comes on stealthy fingers. No Time to Die may not be the worst James Bond movie ever made, but it's in heavy competition as the dullest one since Octopussy. The film's sole distinction is the fact that it's the James Bond epic that finally manages to make 007 a crashing bore.Directed with more boyish slobber than narrative coherence by Cary Joji Fukunaga from an over-crammed, self-consciously contrived script by no fewer than five writers, No Time to Die hops and stumbles all over the place, but you can still write the plot on the head of a carpet tack. It opens with a flashback to the Italian Alps where a mysterious thug in a white mask plods through the snow to murder a young Madeleine Swann's mother, but young Madeleine narrowly escapes. Cut to the character, all grown up as Lea Seydoux, who may or may not be married to a gooey-eyed, lovesick 007. (The movie is very vague about things that matter.) After some high-speed racing through the mountains in his bulletproof Aston Martin, the two lovers are set upon by agents from the evil crime syndicate SPECTRE in the town square and he dumps Madeleine, thinking she betrayed him. It's the end for Bond and Madeleine, but the movie is just beginning. It helps to know your Ian Fleming history, including Bond's relationship with Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale, as well as the meaning of SPECTRE (you got me there). Cut to Bond trying desperately trying to enjoy his retirement in"
142,RDH_Doc2_NoTimeToDie,RDH_Doc2_NoTimeToDie,RDH,Action,Negative,No time to Die,"Historically, the bad James Bond films have been judged so because they were just too wacky and silly. Fortunately, its utter disinterest in a hard and fast continuity meant that a deliciously hyperbolic film like A View to a Kill can erase a hackneyed Octopussy in under two years. Never before has a James Bond film been both technically well-executed and taken a more serious tack, yet still been an infuriating mess. So, congratulations, I guess, No Time to Die. Borderline impenetrable if you haven't rewatched the first four films in the Daniel Craig-era arc, this 25th canonical Bond picks up where the roundly unloved Spectre finished, with Bond in seeming retirement with Madeleine Swann (Seydoux), and a lot of baggage from earlier films that now seems borderline absurd and needlessly convoluted. The big twist in the last film was that Blofeld (Waltz) was Bond's stepbrother and the cause of all his pain, but the villain this time is Malek as Lyutsifer Safin, a waffling, mumbling pseudophilosophical maniac with the standard grand plans for global domination. Meanwhile Bond ends up more alone than ever: out of MI5, replaced as 007 by a new agent (Lynch), and terribly sad about everything. Because the newer, more emotionally rounded Bond is just sad a lot. Yet No Time to Die doesn't take the opportunity to examine Bond in a more stripped-down setting. Instead, it's the standard mix of globetrotting action, just slower and less engaging than ever before. Subplots go nowhere, new characters are dropped in with little payoff (exactly what purpose a side trip to Cuba with Ana de Armas' giddy young CIA rookie serves defies explanation), and much of the dialogue is simply meaningless - particularly every word out of Safin's mouth, which would just be nonsensical if it wasn't also delivered with all the gravitas and malice of a bus timetable. It's ponderous, tedious, and somehow both buried in continuity and determined to drop it all halfway through the story. It's not just recent Bond lore: there's a hamfisted musical sting that serves as a reference to On Her Majesty's Secret Service, further complicating the already convoluted timeline and inherently conflating two of Bond's dead exes. It's this overstuffed storytelling, mixed with lackluster pacing, that renders No Time to Die a torturous misfire, and an utterly disappointing exit for Craig's Bond. I hate to say it, but this is Bond's Rise of Skywalker. That's the saddest part of this era of 007. Craig had two of the best entries in the entire series, with Casino Royale establishing everything that was going to make him unique, and Skyfall hitting like a battering ram. His Bond was an educated assassin, charming and cold, violently loyal to Queen and Country but untrusting of both - just as Ian Fleming wrote him. Yet the last two films have written him into a melancholic corner, adding a supposed emotional depth that he simply doesn't need. Maybe the arc would have worked better across three films,"
143,RDH_Doc3_NoTimeToDie,RDH_Doc3_NoTimeToDie,RDH,Action,Negative,No time to Die,"Nothing can truly kill James Bond, but the COVID-19 pandemic certainly tried, delaying the release of No Time to Die-the MI6 agent's 25th official feature-film outing-by a year and a half. In an unexpected twist, Bond's latest boasts a trace of timely resonance, courtesy of a story that hinges on a nefarious plot to infect the world with a lethal contagion. What's most surprising about Daniel Craig's fifth and final go-round as 007, however, is its general lack of urgency or excitement. A workmanlike swan song that never approaches the highs of Casino Royale or Skyfall, it sends the star out with a whimper rather than a bang. Directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga with all the enthusiasm of an adolescent eating a plateful of Brussels sprouts, No Time to Die (in theaters Oct. 8) is primarily notable for failing to stage a single rousing set piece. Bond swings from a cord off a bridge, engages in some car chases, pilots a glider that transforms into a submarine, and shoots a lot of anonymous henchmen, none of which registers as the least bit remarkable. The fact that the film's climax involves Bond gunning down disposable adversaries in a chemical plant in sub-John Wick fashion says a lot about this installment's level of creativity. Whereas Martin Campbell (Casino Royale) and Sam Mendes (Skyfall) found ways to provide Craig with memorably extravagant and pulse-pounding showstoppers, Fukunaga and his three co-screenwriters fall back on generic action and drama at every available opportunity. Though it plays a familiar globetrotting game (sending Bond to locales as varied as Italy, Jamaica, Cuba, and London) and has been shot with IMAX in mind, No Time to Die is devoid of imposing scale or import. Having felled half-brother Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) and retired to a quiet life with psychiatrist Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux), Bond finds that letting go of the past is tough-particularly when he's nearly blown up while trying to say farewell to former flame Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) at her tomb. Bond comes to believe that Madeleine is behind this unsuccessful assassination and promptly dumps her. Five years later, he's brought back into the spy-business fold by CIA buddy Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), who wants him to retrieve scientist Valdo Obruchev (David Dencik), who's been kidnapped by Spectre baddies interested in wielding the deadly DNA-targeting bioweapon that Obruchev secretly developed for M (Ralph Fiennes) and MI6. Bond thus gains a new mission that puts him at odds with his former employers-who've handed over his 007 designation to a new agent (Lashana Lynch)-as well as the shadowy Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek), who shares a special connection with Madeleine and a mysterious animosity toward Bond's enemies. That's a lot of story, and at 163 minutes, No Time to Die takes its time with all of it, moving at a deliberate pace that never allows momentum to completely flag. Alas, there's scant muscularity or sensuality to its centerpieces, save for the fleeting 15 minutes in which Bond teams"
144,RDH_Doc4_NoTimeToDie,RDH_Doc4_NoTimeToDie,RDH,Action,Negative,No time to Die,"Perhaps it is only fitting that, at the end of a particularly circuitous journey, one would get a little emotional. There was such sentiment in a video of actor Daniel Craig, choking back tears as he thanked crew members after wrapping on his final James Bond film, No Time to Die. And there it is in Bond himself-and just about everything surrounding him-in Cary Joji Fukunaga's 165-minute film, an epic that doesn't so much trot the globe as trudge solemnly across it, laden with loss and life's accumulated weariness. Does that sound fun? The powers that be sure hope it does, as No Time to Die finally arrives in theaters on October 8 after many COVID-related delays. It is perhaps the great theater-exclusive tentpole dream of the fall, that eager audiences wanting to zip off on another suave adventure while also saying goodbye to an entire generation's James Bond will flock to cineplexes and help revive a flagging industry. But then the trilogy became a quadrilogy with 2015's tiresome, extraneous Spectre, certainly a big hit but not the rumbling cultural event that was Skyfall. Craig couldn't go out on that sour note. Thus we have No Time to Die, the definitive-they swear!-conclusion of Craig's run and, presumably, the end of this particular stylistic Bond era. That's a lot of weight to put on one movie's shoulders, and yet No Time to Die-written by Fukunaga, Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge-happily adds even more. We've got existential reckoning, ancient grudges, child endangerment, and death that actually matters. This is very serious stuff, to a definite fault. Roughly the first half of the film is limber and amiable, as a retired (yet again) Bond is dragged back into action to close a loop begun, essentially, in Casino Royale. On his way to doing that, Bond has a motorcycle-cum-car chase in a stunning Italian hill town, a meet-tart with a new 00 agent (Lashana Lynch), and a trip to Cuba for a bit of dapperly-dressed, party-interrupting violence that is the movie at its most appealingly free-wheeling. Ana de Armas makes a bright appearance as a local spy who helps Bond with the Cuba mission, and then she's gone, merrily disappearing back into some other movie. As the rest of No Time to Die unfolded, I began to wish we'd followed her. What follows those bursts of typically Bondian elan is ponderously weighted and thinly plotted. There is a mystery afoot involving a stolen bio weapon, a mysterious figure (Rami Malek) with a scarred face (surely the true sign of evil), and Dr. Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux), whom Bond met in Spectre and is now deeply in love with. (Don't worry: Bond's last great love, Eva Green's dearly departed Vesper Lynd, gets some mentions in the movie too.) I do feel like we've covered that already, though. I'm having a little trouble coming up with the exact Bond films that addressed this topic, but I'm pretty sure they're out there. Or maybe I'm"
145,RDH_Doc5_NoTimeToDie,RDH_Doc5_NoTimeToDie,RDH,Action,Negative,No time to Die,"The new James Bond flick No Time to Die takes place amid the prospect of a worldwide pandemic unleashed from a laboratory where scientists are specifically trying to engineer insanely dangerous biological weapons, but that's not the only reason I found the movie a bit uncomfortable. Directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, who is best known for season 1 of True Detective, Bond 25 is the least fun and most somber excursion in the entire Bond series, as well as being by far the longest 007 movie. Two hours and 43 minutes? Really? Fukunaga, who has indicated that he finds the Bond character highly problematic and is essentially an art-house director, was an odd choice to take over the saga, which is heavy on drama and pretty much free of the cheesy, campy stuff that people tend to love most. Despite the movie's huge budget, the action scenes are nothing special, and he mainly survives on luck and/or the incompetence of the various hired assassins chasing him. Fukunaga discards key elements of the franchise and leans heavily into rebuilding the Bond story around emotions and relationships, particularly Bond's love affair with psychiatrist Madeleine (Lea Seydoux), who turns out to be something of an expert killer also, and Felix (Jeffrey Wright), the CIA agent who lures Bond out of retirement to go after a missing biologist in Cuba. The scientist, Obruchev (David Dencik) is a turncoat working on a secret British bioweapon (codename: Heracles) that was specifically designed to cause maximum potential carnage under the auspices of the spy chief M (Ralph Fiennes). Obruchev seems to be yet another of those pesky SPECTRE agents who keep imperiling the world, but still: big oopsie for MI6 for creating this potential catastrophe. The viruses rely on nanobots that can be programmed to target any individual based on DNA or to wipe out any group, such as a race. I trust M's next job will be working for the Chinese Communist Party. Working for the CIA instead of MI6, Bond teams up with a beautiful CIA agent (Ana de Armas) for a shootout to try to capture the rogue scientist, then discovers that his old employer has replaced him with another 007. Naturally, she's a black woman (Lashana Lynch). Bond doesn't sleep with either of these agents, nor with Moneypenny (Naomie Harris), who is taking a break from her super-spying to do secretarial stuff, and so the movie might as well be subtitled The Spy with Whom I Had a Completely Appropriate and Professional Relationship. Bond is still a bit hung up on Madeleine, even after their relationship status switches from ""together"" to ""it's complicated."" She has a key link with Blofeld (Christoph Waltz), who is in prison but up to no good whatsoever, and rules one of the best scenes in the movie, one of the few that feels like a throwback to old Bond movies. Lurking behind Blofeld is a new supervillain, Safin (Rami Malek), who is the mastermind of a terrifying island"
146,RDH_Doc6_NoTimeToDie,RDH_Doc6_NoTimeToDie,RDH,Action,Positive,No time to Die,"If it wasn't obvious before, it is now. We have been living through a great era for James Bond movies - and that era ends spectacularly with ""No Time to Die."" The new movie takes its place among the best of the entire series. What makes it especially satisfying is that this is a Bond film specifically tailored to Daniel Craig and all that he's brought to the role. Give the same script to another actor, and you'd still have a good movie. But with Craig, you have a movie informed by 15 years of history, by the other Craig films working the same ideas and emotions, all about the need for love and the difficulty of trusting someone. These themes would seem too touchy-feely for James Bond, were it not for Craig's mask of stoicism and his ability to convey a world of feeling through his eyes. Equally important is that ""No Time to Die"" never fails to deliver on all the other things audiences expect from a James Bond movie: intricate, imaginative and grand-scale action sequences, exotic locations and an opportunity for him to say two things - ""Bond, James Bond"" and ""shaken, not stirred."" This time Bond begins the movie the way he usually ends them, in a beautiful place with a beautiful woman and seemingly without a care. He's retired, and now he and Madeleine (Lea Seydoux), whom he met in ""Spectre"" (2015), are in a hill town in Italy, living a perpetual vacation as they decide how to move forward with their lives together. Of course, we know this idyll can't last, but the way the movie explodes into action mode here is particularly satisfying. ""No Time to Die"" throws us right into things even before the credits roll. This movie was delayed for 17 months because of the coronavirus pandemic. This time the threat to human civilization involves a man-made pathogen, a poison that can be communicated like a virus, but one that's targeted specifically to a person's DNA. The British have been developing it as a clean way of assassinating people, but a dangerous lunatic named Safin (Rami Malek) figures out a way to steal it and adjust the weapon so that it can kill entire nations in about an hour. ""No Time to Die"" isn't the easiest movie to follow, but it's entertaining enough that you might either be happy to be lost or not notice that you are. The broad outlines are what matters. The British have screwed up, and they've put their new Agent 007 (Lashana Lynch) on the case. Meanwhile, the Americans have recruited Bond to save the world, again. Somehow all of this is related to Blofeld (Christoph Waltz), who is locked up Hannibal Lecter-style in a mental institution, and also to Madeleine. Fukunaga can also take some credit for the fact that all the performances are strong and vivid. Waltz has a single scene. Ana de Armas, as a fledgling agent, has one big one. Jeffrey Wright,"
147,RDH_Doc7_NoTimeToDie,RDH_Doc7_NoTimeToDie,RDH,Action,Positive,No time to Die,"Deviating from a formula as well-ironed as one of its hero's tuxes, No Time to Die bids goodbye to Daniel Craig with so many surprises, it's tough to know where to start. There are big, unprecedented storytelling decisions; Bond relates to not one, but several women as equals; and at one point, he makes pancakes for a small child. The nicest surprise of them all, though, is just how good it is. Much-delayed, not least by a switch of directors when Danny Boyle left and Cary Fukunaga stepped in, it finally arrives as a reminder of the big-screen power of a blockbuster franchise firing on all cylinders. It's the funniest Bond in forever, too, with a zingy script (quite possibly due to Phoebe Waller-Bridge's contributions) delivered by Craig and co with aplomb. Bond's opening reintroduction - involving a town square, his DB5 and half of Spectre, as he's pulled out of a romantic reverie with Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux) - is an all-timer that shakes the cobwebs from the franchise in ten crunching minutes. From dapper and loved-up, Craig is soon back to how we know and love him: bruised and battered and heeding the siren call of duty, as the CIA and MI6 joust over a missing nanoweapon. Fukunaga and his cinematographer Linus Sandgren (La La Land) find visual grace notes everywhere. One sequence set in a Havana hacienda might be the most offbeat thing seen in a franchise that, let's not forget, has also featured a crocodile submarine and Christopher Walken. It has Bond and Ana de Armas's CIA spook prowling through what seems to be a David Lynch cheese dream, in pursuit of a rogue scientist with access to that humanity-threatening MacGuffin. Beefing up the roster of female characters is Lashana Lynch's 00 agent Nomi, who shares a nice anti-chemistry with Bond that feels like a meaningful step forward for both characters. And the villain? Rami Malek's scarred Safin mostly pulls the strings from off screen, but gets his moment in a third act that will thrill anyone yearning for the massive sets of the Ken Adam era and the megalomaniac dreams of Dr No. If a runtime of close to three hours sounds like a red flag, this Bond is a surprisingly lean beast. It zips from one adroitly chosen location to another (add Matera in southern Italy to your bucket list ASAP), but the slower, character-driven scenes - the undoing of some recent Bonds - really sing too. Only Naomie Harris's Moneypenny is shortchanged. After her dynamic intro as a field agent in Skyfall, the franchise seems at a loss for what to do with her, with Lynch's Nomi stepping into the gap she might have filled. Even MI6's resident meme, Tanner (Rory Kinnear), gets more heavy lifting to do. Other grumbles centre on a climactic battle that overstays its welcome, and one or two bits of unnecessarily jarring violence. But by whatever metrics you measure a Bond movie - tight plotting, gnarly villains, emotional"
148,RDH_Doc8_NoTimeToDie,RDH_Doc8_NoTimeToDie,RDH,Action,Positive,No time to Die,"In a world without SARS-CoV-2, a year and a half would have passed since Daniel Craig had retired as James Bond. Instead, cinema's leading spy has spent the last 18 months on furlough, while successive waves of Covid sloshed around the globe. But as the end credits have always promised, James Bond will return. And return he finally has, with Cary Joji Fukunaga's extravagantly satisfying, bulgingly proportioned last chapter to the Craig era, which throws almost everything there is left to throw at 007 - including, in a twist of teeth-clenching pertinence, a man-made virus which threatens to overrun the globe. That's right: the very blockbuster cinemas have been counting on for 18 months to ease business out of a pandemic hinges on the imminent threat of another one. This one goes by the name of Heracles, is made up of DNA-hijacking nanobots, and is pilfered from a secret London laboratory by SPECTRE, who plan to use it for the sort of obviously nefarious purposes that ought to have occurred to its creators. With the goo on the loose, it falls to Bond to retrieve it, though not via his old MI6 handlers. After a sensationally thrilling and sinister prologue - the franchise's longest by far, running for around 23 minutes - the Billie Eilish torch song kicks in, and then we're five years into James's retirement in Jamaica, where the CIA's Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) stops by and asks him to round up the rogue scientist (David Dencik) who was complicit in the leak. To an extent, No Time to Die is in keeping with its immediate predecessors, 2012's Skyfall and 2015's Spectre. The stakes are simultaneously global and personal, and there are many ritualistic re-tracings of ideas and images from Bond adventures past. But there are differences, too. For one thing, it's unfashionably colourful. Thank La La Land cinematographer Linus Sandgren for the gorgeous dawns and dusks, plus the rich, sun-blush tones of an early chase scene through the mazy alleys of Matera, the Italian hill town where Bond goes with Dr Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux) to lay his grudge against Eva Green's Vesper Lynd to rest. It's one of the great Bond action sequences, both for its dazzling choreography and Fukunaga's flair for loading individual shots with menacing detail and portent. The perilous motorcycle jumps and multiple hair's-breadth brushes with death are all suitably gasp-inducing, but so is the shot of Seydoux's face stricken with sincere terror, and the gradual buckling of the reinforced windows of Bond's Aston Martin as bullets steadily kick at the glass. It's also often very funny indeed. The mood is regularly closer to the perkier passages of the Connery films than anything else from the Craig years, and the humour feels contemporary and British: the Phoebe Waller-Bridge script polish evidently yielded the desired result. (Rory Kinnear's Bill Tanner describes Christoph Waltz's Blofeld - who puts in a respectable shift of Hannibal Lecter-esque cell-based gurning - as ""mad as a bag of bees"".)"
149,RDH_Doc9_NoTimeToDie,RDH_Doc9_NoTimeToDie,RDH,Action,Positive,No time to Die,"The standard bearer of British soft power is back, in a film yanked from cinemas back in the time of the toilet roll shortage, based on a literary character conceived when sugar and meat rationing was still in force, and now released as Britons are fighting for petrol on the forecourts. Bond, like Norma Desmond, is once again ready for his closeup - and Daniel Craig once again shows us his handsome-Shrek face and the lovable bat ears, flecked with the scars of yesterday's punch-up, the lips as ever pursed in determination or disgust. And Craig's final film as the diva of British intelligence is an epic barnstormer, with the script from Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Phoebe Waller-Bridge delivering pathos, drama, camp comedy (Bond will call M ""darling"" in moments of tetchiness), heartbreak, macabre horror, and outrageously silly old-fashioned action in a movie which calls to mind the world of Dr No on his island. Director Cary Fukunaga delivers it with terrific panache, and the film also shows us a romantic Bond, a uxorious Bond, a Bond who is unafraid of showing his feelings, like the old softie he's turned out to be. A queasy and dreamlike prelude hints at a terrible formative trauma in the childhood of Dr Madeleine Swann (a gorgeously reserved Lea Seydoux), that enigmatic figure we saw in the last movie who is now enjoying a romantic getaway with James. But a shocking act of violence destroys their idyll, as we knew it must, and Bond has some spectacular stunts as he hurls himself from a bridge. It all has a lot to do with a sinister biowarfare plan called ""Heracles"" being developed by M (Ralph Fiennes) using a renegade scientist Obruchev (David Dencik) - but both creepy boffin and weapon are stolen in a sequence of preposterous action comedy, incidentally involving a sullen, bickering functionary played in cameo by Hugh Dennis. Both MI6 and the CIA want Obruchev back - but British intelligence does not care to involve Bond who is now in retirement in Jamaica, perhaps in tribute to Ian Fleming's holiday retreat, and M has handed over his 007 status to a new agent Nomi, stylishly played by Lashana Lynch. But the Americans, in the form of his old buddy Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) and an uptight new state department appointee Logan Ash (Billy Magnussen) persuade Bond to take on the job as a freelance, and send him to Cuba, where he liaises with an untrained operative: Paloma - a witty and unworldly turn from Ana de Armas whose rapport with Craig recalls their chemistry in Knives Out. The Cuban nightclub scene has something genuinely bizarre about it, bringing us a henchman with a surreal glass eye. The awful truth is that M has allowed ""Heracles"" to be compromised by the creepy Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) who is being kept by the Brits in Lecter-ish imprisonment, but has managed to direct this new plan from his hi-tech cell, but who is now himself"
150,RDH_Doc10_NoTimeToDie,RDH_Doc10_NoTimeToDie,RDH,Action,Positive,No time to Die,"""No Time to Die"" is a terrific movie: an up-to-the-minute, down-to-the-wire James Bond thriller with a satisfying neoclassical edge. It's an unabashedly conventional Bond film that's been made with high finesse and just the right touch of soul, as well as enough sleek surprise to keep you on edge. Before I go further, though, let me lay my baccarat cards on the table. I thought ""Casino Royale,"" the first film in which Daniel Craig portrayed 007, was the greatest Bond film since the early Sean Connery days, and in many ways the most perfectly realized Bond movie ever. (I've seen it countless times, and it's one of my favorite films of its era.) To me, the trio of Bond films that came after ""Casino Royale"" have added up to one of the most profoundly disappointing follow-throughs of any contemporary film series. ""Quantum of Solace"" was all trumped-up mechanics, ""Spectre"" was an elaborate piece of product that went through the motions -- and ""Skyfall,"" though I realize many Bond watchers think it's a masterpiece, was, to me, sodden and overstated, with a meta-hammy megalomaniac performance by Javier Bardem and a backstory to Bond that was maudlin with self-pity. The film was trying to be ""emotional,"" but that poor-little-spy-boy origin story didn't enlarge Bond - it diminished him. The truth is that so many elements of what the Bond films originally brought to cinema have been incorporated into other film series - the ""Mission: Impossible"" films, the ""Bourne"" films, the ""Fast and Furious"" films - that to create a first-rate Bond adventure, something more is required. You need an ingenious weave of elements: the perfect layered rhythm of brashly timed fights and great escapes and bedazzling chases and delectable quips and cool gadgets and sexy one-upmanship and the ultimate in world-domination stakes. ""No Time to Die,"" at 2 hours and 43 minutes, is the longest Bond film ever, yet it's brisk and heady and sharp. The director, Cary Joji Fukunaga (HBO's ""True Detective""), keeps the elements in balance like an ace juggler. He gets the details right - the split-second leaping-off-the-balcony action scenes, the menace of an assassin with a vagrant mechanical eyeball, the persnickety droll fun of Ben Whishaw's performance as Q. Beyond that, though, there needs to be a touch of mystery to Bond. That's the quality that ""Casino Royale"" brought back to the series through its fantastically tricky dramatization of the relationship between Craig's fast, steely, roughneck Bond and Eva Green's insinuating Vesper Lynd. And ""No Time to Die,"" though it's not the work of art ""Casino Royale"" was, possesses just enough of that quality. Ideally, there's a romance to a James Bond movie -- I don't just mean a love story, but a romance to Bond's presence, a grander motive behind the ruthless execution of his every move. ""No Time to Die"" has that. In the introductory sequence, we see Lea Seydoux's Madeleine as a young girl and the cataclysm she endured at the hands of a man"
151,ESS_Doc1_Equilibrium,ESS_Doc1_Equilibrium,ESS,Sci-Fi,Positive,Equilibrium,"A stunning dystopian piece with fiercely fun combat! Director Kurt Wimmer's science-fiction action-drama Equilibrium (2002) is unfairly lambasted by critics and ignored by movie going audiences. I found myself enjoying revisiting Equilibrium as much, if not more, than when I first saw Equilibrium. I think Equilibrium holds up beautifully. The gun-kata is ridiculous and not as efficient as it pretends to be, like The Matrix' slow motion chaotic combat in a more highly choreographed fashion. However, gun-kata is such an absurdly entertaining, stylish, and slick way to shoot action combat sequences, so who cares if the gun-kata is not realistic? Kurt Wimmer's direction is fabulously sleek and emotionally engaging like he combined the stunning cinematography of Gattaca's sci-fi dystopia with the premise of Fahrenheit 451 and Brave New World or 1984. Equilibrium is quite moving seeing art destroyed and citizens killed just for feeling. Wimmer shows you ordinary people getting gunned down or incinerated to death for convincing depictions of why exterminating emotions with lethal force is just as cruel and violent as humanity's hatred and warfare. Kurt Wimmer's writing is really touching as he understands you must make the viewer care about Preston and humanity with really empathetic and poetic dialogue. His fearsome sci-fi speeches by the autocrat Father are the stuff of 1984 and V for Vendetta dystopian nightmares. I love how Equilibrium focuses on the growing emotional epiphanies that the hero Preston starts to feel. Honestly, Equilibrium is a better adaptation of Fahrenheit 451 than most actual film adaptations of the novel. Writer and director Kurt Wimmer did a wonderful job with Equilibrium. Christian Bale's solemn hero John Preston goes from stoic, book burning, secret police, Grammaton Cleric to devastatingly moving resistor to the political order. Bale knows how to portray a cold, unfeeling killer as well as a deeply felt protagonist, who has changed his entire personality. Bale uses his tearful eyes to show how touched he is by poetic words and lovely music. His use of expressive body language shows when Preston is nervous or tense to calm and reassured. I loved Christian Bale in Equilibrium. Emily Watson is incredible as the fierce and thoughtful as conscientious objector Mary O'Brien. You can feel how gentle and emotional Mary is with Watson's graceful and moving supporting actress performance. Taye Diggs is great as being smug and observant as the treacherously loyal to a fault Brandt. Angus Macfadyen is interesting and commanding as the ultra serious cleric leader Dupont. Sean Bean is only in Equilibrium for a few minutes, but he's unforgettable as the sincerely feeling Errol Partridge. William Fichtner has real gravitas and intelligence as Jurgen. I like that director Kurt Wimmer cameos as a resistance fighter during one raid. Editors Tom Rolf and William Yeh cut sharply throughout Equilibrium with these hard cuts to Christian Bale's face to get his every reaction to the brutal violence before him. They keep the story moving quickly and never lose sight of Equilibrium's purpose in conveying human emotion"
152,ESS_Doc2_Equilibrium,ESS_Doc2_Equilibrium,ESS,Sci-Fi,Positive,Equilibrium,"My friend recommended this film to me, which starred Christian Bale and it looked interesting so I thought I would give it go. It turns out for me Equilibrium is one of the most stunning films to be made. The basic story is set in the future after a third world war, human society changes. It becomes the catalyst for what the person in charge called Seamus (Dominic Purcell) calls ""Our Great Society"" where humans are banned by law to not feel emotion of any kind like love, anger and hate because he believes emotions are the key to human destruction. Anything like music or art associated with emotions is also banned. If any human is caught ""feeling"", they are executed. Seamus appoints head cleric John Preston (Christian Bale) to keep order in society as everyone has to daily inject themselves with a drug Prozium that suppresses the human emotions. But Preston decides to forgo the injections and begins to experience emotion as he rises to overthrow the system by allying himself with a human resistance movement that feel emotion and embrace it. This movie is only an hour and thirty five minutes long, but it is a captivating and entertaining one. The story for me (whether this sort of idea has been done before I do not know) is highly original. I found it fascinating as this idea of emotions and society is explored well. By restricting humans to feel any sort of emotions even positive ones like love and if they do they are executed, Seamus and the person who in overall charge is the Father, become like a totalitarianism regime like Hilter, which is ironic given the fact that the people are shown world war II and the rise of Hilter in Germany as the source of the destruction that is accompanied by emotions. Is the new society just as bad by slaughtering those that they feel? Are Seamus and the Father exactly like Hitler? These are questions that are well explored. This is helped by excellent performances by Christian Bale who is the principal villain at the start particularly when he had eradicate his first partner Partridge, a small part played superbly by Sean Bean. Bale is cold and uncomprehending but he starts to change when he fails to take his Prozium injection. It's a wonder and sadness to see him save a little puppy and touch walls and a woman's hand as he strokes it. Bale captures the part beautifully and I felt deeply for him. The cinematography is amazing with natural grey lighting to convey the falseness of the ""great society"" and the action, though similar to The Matrix is absolutely incredibly choreographed making it entertainment of the highest grade. There are also a couple of good twists later on in the movie that I liked, which kept me guessing. Equilibrium is a fascinating, original and superbly made and acted sci-fi and Bale owns the part. He was even better in this than he"
153,ESS_Doc3_Equilibrium,ESS_Doc3_Equilibrium,ESS,Sci-Fi,Positive,Equilibrium,"Set in a future, post-World War III society where emotions have been outlawed, Equilibrium tells the story of John Preston (Christian Bale), a government agent who begins to have doubts about the policy he is enforcing. Equilibrium is the perfect example why I do not rate lower for derivativeness or unoriginality. The film is basically high-concept combination of Fahrenheit 451 (1966), George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (original published in 1949, film versions appeared in 1954, 1956 and 1984), The Matrix (1999) and a bit of The Wizard of Oz (1939) thrown in for good measure. What matters is not how original the ideas are (assuming it's not a case of plagiarism), as whether something is original or not is an epistemological problem that tells us more about our own familiarity with other material rather than the precedent status of the artwork we're questioning, but how well the material is handled. The high-concept material in Equilibrium is handled brilliantly. On its surface, after a brief action-oriented beginning, Equilibrium is basically a progression from a fairly complex sci-fi film (meaning simply that it takes a lot of exposition to get up to speed) to a thriller to a ""gun fu""-styled actioner. The progression is carried out deftly by writer/director Kurt Wimmer (who unfortunately hasn't shown the same level of elegant panache in other films I've seen from him, including Sphere (1998) and The Recruit (2003)), with all of the genres somewhat present throughout the film. Wimmer is so austerely slick here that Equilibrium sometimes resembles a postmodernist automobile commercial. The transition from genre to genre is incredibly smooth. The most impressive material on this surface level is the gun fu action stuff, which almost ""out-Matrixes"" The Matrix in style, if not volume. Preston is so skilled to be an almost invincible opponent. His solitary misstep as a fighter occurs once he gives himself over to emotion. This is nicely related to the common advice from kung fu senseis that emotion lessens one's effectiveness in combat. Of course a big part of Equilibrium is the set of philosophical points it has to make about emotion. There are sections of the film that are appropriately dialogue-heavy, and Wimmer is more than conspicuous with this (one of two) primary theme(s). Just as important as dialogue for Wimmer's commentary on man's emotions are body language and behavior. Some viewers might see it as a flaw that characters frequently show what they consider to be signs of emotions in their comments or behavior, but that's part of Wimmer's agenda. Because it's difficult to even say just what counts as an emotion, and emotions are so wrapped-up with being sentient beings, it would be difficult if not impossible to fully eliminate them, and it's certainly not recommendable. The cast does an excellent job of portraying characters who are supposed to be mostly emotionless but with cracks in the stoic armor continually poking through. Wimmer has a harsh view of our society's self-medication epidemic--even the title of the film"
154,ESS_Doc4_Equilibrium,ESS_Doc4_Equilibrium,ESS,Sci-Fi,Positive,Equilibrium,"An underrated piece of art, this bleak future where emotions are forbidden has an ironic emotional core to it. It doesn't surround itself with blatant copies of Fahrenheit 451 and 1984, in fact, what many people would assume are carbon copies I would prefer to call references, harking back to other dystopian films while also being a standalone film in its own right. Equilibrium treats the matter with mild stoicism, foreshadowing particular events in a neat way that manages to explode in a thrilling yet thoughtful way. The ignorance of many critics that assumed the worst, didn't seem to see the whole picture. None of this was about the fact that censorship exists or that you could be executed for certain crimes. The whole idea of the film was to make you see how people behaved through lack of emotion, with the failure to see that emotion is what makes us human. Rather than take a purely political motive, it manages to incorporate perhaps a majorly ethical motive. The action that is contained in this film is not just for showing off. The stylistic features render the action scenes mindblowing, but no less helping to drive the core theme of the story - besides, the main character is a cleric, trained in the art of Gun Kata (a thrilling name for a sadly non-existent masterpiece of fighting style) who manages to put a chink in Libria's armour as we see through his perspective by realising he can use this weapon against the system that attempts and fails to betray him as someone who is 'feeling'. When I first regarded this film, I became fascinated about how, amongst the close-ups and wider shots, the main character seems to obviously show some kind of emotion without the intrusion of the system demanding why on earth he hasn't been arrested for his crimes. This ultimately came to the climax, whereby the foreshadowing managed to sneak its way in at the beginning. The fact that Christian Bale was chosen for this role makes me wonder why some people didn't think this was good, considering how deft he was in executing the action, the visual non-speaking scenes and the dialogue. To the amazing use of irony, a number of heart-rending scenes kept up the core theme, and the stylistic use of camera focus on Christian Bale emphasised the distress that we could feel he was going through, one being his flinching when we don't see the dogs being shot, but we can feel it by way of his reaction. However, I thought one of the most chilling scenes was during a raid of someone's apartment, with fires burning and people spattered with blood, was the simplicity of a dying man running into the main character, known as John Preston, bleeding, desperation and hope glittering in his eyes as he slides down, leaving Preston aghast and completely horrified, reflecting the man's pain. The expression on his face could not have been possibly matched, Christian Bale just"
155,ESS_Doc5_Equilibrium,ESS_Doc5_Equilibrium,ESS,Sci-Fi,Positive,Equilibrium,"I bought Equilibrium just because Christian Bale is in it. To tell you the truth I was certain that it was going to be a goofy, direct-to-video sci-fi fiasco that most involved would just as soon forget. The cover box reminded me of Universal Soldier. As it turns out however, it's not a movie that those involved want to forget, it's an overlooked gem, no doubt because it came at the height of the Matrix craze, which it may resemble in too many ways. Unfortunately, too many people will callously write it off as a Matrix rip-off, and it's a shame because this is one of the best science fiction films to have come along in quite some time. It takes place in the far off 21st century, but it's not about the future (given that it exists in a future that can't ever exist), it's about the disturbing reality that war is a part of human nature, and in order to eradicate it from the modern world we would have to become a homogenized society of emotionless, drug-controlled zombies. No jokes about that already being a reality. The movie's biggest assertion is that it assigns blame for man's inhumanity to man to his ability to feel (ignoring the real causes, such as religion, political power, and less dogmatic things like national pride and human rights). The current government is based on enforcing the mass removal of emotion from the masses using a drug called Prozium, and is the source of the movie's main irony, that in order to eradicate war, it has waged war on all of it's own citizens, who constantly live under close surveillance. The government employs Grammaton Clerics to handle that surveillance. They are highly trained officers authorized to kill anyone they deem to be ""sense offenders"" on the spot (""I trust you'll be more vigilant in the future?""). There is, in fact, a staggering amount of irony in the film, given that all emotion or feeling is strictly forbidden under penalty of death, and yet anger, suspicion and fear are all alive and well, and even flaunted. It's also interesting to consider that in real life it is the dogmatic, Cleric-like believers who aspire for war, and the normal people who just want to live their lives. For the most part the movie ignores the fact that it is governments that wage war, not citizens (even emotionally sensitive ones), but no matter. The important thing that you need to know about the movie is that it goes way, way too far, and because of that, it's fun. I cheered out loud several times during the film because the gun fights, which are so unrealistic it's almost funny, are genuinely well-choreographed and exciting. If I may say so, this is what gun fights in hard core science fiction movies should look like. Many people criticize the movie for being unrealistic or too extreme, altogether forgetting what kind of movie they're watching in the first place. The"
156,ESS_Doc6_Equilibrium,ESS_Doc6_Equilibrium,ESS,Sci-Fi,Negative,Equilibrium,"Praised as an underrated sci-fi action film, Equilibrium sounded like an exciting genre piece. A common criticism of Equilibrium is that it is a derivative science fiction piece, a factor hard to ignore in the experience. The derivative nature of the story becomes clear relatively quickly as it is heavily rooted in the predictable nature of the story formula. Equilibrium's formula is one which dates back through countless science fiction narratives such as the recent Repo Men (2010) and as far back as Logan's Run (1976) in which the protagonist is an outstanding member of a government task force at first before later beginning to question the structure of their society, going rogue and changing the world. The entire black suit aesthetic of the society as well as the combination of science fiction and martial arts also echoes clear similarity to The Matrix (1999). There are a few minor twists along the way with the supporting characters gaining arbitrary relevance to the story, but there ends up being few surprises in Equilibrium. Beyond its derivative nature, the story in Equilibrium fails to capture its full potential. The intro points out that a new war has changed the face of humanity without explaining the finer details of who was involved in the war or exactly what political implications were either behind it or resulting from it. This plot point is essentially a token story element to create a generic dystopian setting in which serves as the backdrop for an action thriller with the deeper meaning in the story being very sporadic. Yet even though the film functions better as an action film, the generic story still takes top priority. So audiences are dragged through an abundance of predictable and cliche plot points with a lot of talking and different attempts at universe building. The dialogue is fairly solid as it captures the tone of the film without ever being cringe-worthy, but the universe building in Equilibrium is blunted by the film's inability to delve into its deeper ambitions. Ultimately, the story in Equilibrium really lets audiences down while the action is too rare and brief for it to hide behind. Nevertheless, director Kurt Wimmer deserves praise for his stylistic ambition. Despite the limited depth in the story, the fact is that he creates a very convincing and visually appealing universe for Equilibrium on a very modest budget. At the cost of only $20 million, the man proves capable of creating a convincing and grim dystopia. The production design carries both the technological brilliance of a futuristic society and the dry emptiness of a world in shambles while the monotonous and grim colour scheme captures the bleak uniformity of the society. The scenery provides a powerful backdrop to this all while the costume design infuses it to the characters. If you really try and focus on how the film got away on such a small budget you'll pick up on the fact that the trick is to mediate the use of semi-detailed"
157,ESS_Doc7_Equilibrium,ESS_Doc7_Equilibrium,ESS,Sci-Fi,Negative,Equilibrium,"I'm a huge sci-fi fan, so I tend to be more forgiving to shortcomings in movies made within this genre compared to many others. But 'Equilibrium' had such major flaws that I couldn't even let it slide as OK entertainment. There are a lot of small things here & there through the film that I find hard to accept, but I won't bother with them because the overwhelming problem is the basic premise that the whole story relies on. Here we are told that after world war 3 there is a totalitarian government which have so much intelligence & technology that they're able to produce a drug that can turn every citizen into a human robot by completely suppressing all their feelings. This government also have so much power that they can convince the vast majority of ordinary people to take this monster drug every day, because the removal of human feelings is supposed to prevent another devastating war. (Yes, we must immediately forget - just as the movie's government & people obviously did - that rather than emotional, the reasons for war are infinitely much more likely to be purely practical; like the need for natural resources, food & land). To make sure the above policy is enforced the rulers have lots of heavily armed men that are ready to track & kill anybody who won't take the drug. But then we also learn that even though the government possess all this amazing intelligence, technology and power, they are not able to suppress a resistance movement whose major interests when staying off the drug seem to be the urge to read poetry and look at pictures of girls and flowers? I'm sorry, I just can't buy into all that. Actually I couldn't do anything but laugh when the first action scene showed a group of tough rugged men with big guns ruthlessly kill and be killed for the right to ... watch old oil paintings! C'mon people, that's not deep, it's just stupid. George Orwell wrote the classic book '1984' about totalitarian states, and he knew more about this subject way back in the 1940's than 'Equilibrium' writer/director Kurt Wimmer does today. In Orwell's book the state doesn't try to keep the big majority of the people under total control, because everybody with reasonable intelligence understand that this is impossible. Instead the state give some advantages to smaller groups who in exchange help them, and these collaborators are then kept under extreme surveillance and threatened with horrible punishment if they become disobedient, because the collaborators are the ones that really make or break the men in power. In 'Equilibrium', maybe you are willing to look past the impossibility that somebody could invent a single drug that totally suppressed all of the strong emotions we humans have. But why then would a totalitarian power waste their resources on the even more impossible task of forcing every single person to take this drug every single day? Not to mention the hopeless"

Quite simply, it's amazing that this film even got made, being nothing more than a sorry, derivative ragbag of pilfered ideas, with not a single one of its own to justify its existence. The nearest one can come to describing this Frankenstein monster of a travesty is ""1984"" crossed with ""The Matrix"", and the latter wasn't exactly blindingly original to begin with. As if this isn't bad enough, the film is loaded with inconsistencies and plot holes, all shoddily papered over in the name of convenience as well as scenes and dialogue so hackneyed you can see them coming a mile off (and if you can't, you should really see more films. Preferably good ones). I actually uttered one line seconds before the character did, and had to stifle risible laughter when Preston came face to face with the itty bitty, cutesy-wutesy puppy. (In this scene, please note that the budget having probably been spent all on bullets didn't seem to stretch to any sort of animal training, as it relies on actors pointing off-camera and saying, ""Stop it! It's getting away!"" and reaching down, most unconvincingly). Laughter, in fact, is the only realistic response to the majority of this farrago, if only to stave off the angry realisation that your time is being wasted. You want laughs? AND HERE BE SPOILERS (although it's kind of hard to spoil something that's already this rank, IMHO) In the lead up to the ""climactic"" fight, one character warns Preston that, should he get too close to""Father"" (highly original name for a ""Big Brother"" figure, eh? Lucky they didn't call him ""Uncle"" or ""Second Cousin Twice Removed"") he'll be shot down by snipers. When the spit hits the fan, however, there are no snipers, not a one: only an endless parade of policemen, doing what they do best throughout: dying. Honest, these guys, despite their fierce get-up, turn out to be the most useless, butter-fingered cannon-fodder since the Imperial Stormtroopers in the original ""Star Wars"" (and countless other Z-grade imitations). Once you realise that they couldn't hit a barn door at ten feet and that their tactics seem to consist of merely lining up to get gunned down, you're left with no tension, nothing at stake and only the tedious sight of moronic sitting ducks being blown away, noisily, time and time and time and time again. It doesn't help that, having walked Preston into a trap and taken his weapon, they don't think to search him for anything else, leaving him free to conceal guns and an abundance of spare ammo, as well as a complicated reloading mechanism...all up his sleeves. Good thing nobody shook his hand. This is the film's idea of a ""twist"": a development so implausible, so gobsmackingly unlikely that it's an insult to any intelligent film-goer. ""Equilibrium"" is the kind of film so shoddily made and yet so pretentious, it just cries out"
159,ESS_Doc9_Equilibrium,ESS_Doc9_Equilibrium,ESS,Sci-Fi,Negative,Equilibrium,"Here's a true story: This evening, I went to see a movie called ""Equilibrium."" Now normally, I save every movie ticket and throw them in a shoebox filled with precious mementos. On my trip through the parking lot, I pulled out my Zippo and proceeded to burn it. Then proceeded to speed home, so I could take an extremely violent crap. I don't know what was worse; how painful the bowel movement was, or how painful the movie was. Roger Ebert gave this movie 3 stars out of 4. As soon as I'm done writing this review, I'm going to track him down and force-feed him his review. Laced with Strychnine. I realize you're probably thinking, ""Shouldn't the punishment fit the crime?"" But frankly, I'm a busy man, and I don't have time for 6 months of chakra torture. I suppose you're expecting some sort of review of the movie, so I guess I should make an attempt. Then again, if I put as much effort into this review as writer/director Kurt Wimmer put into his screenplay, I could call it a day right now. ""Equilibrium"" gives us a society, Libria, which is opiated by a drug known as Librium, a necessity after World War III. The survivors in power decided that it was man's emotion that led to war, and in order to prevent any such future occurrences, they constructed a society based on emotionless. This is aided by the destruction of all art, music, and cultural relics, not to mention 3 doses a day of the aforementioned Librium injection. Those who forsake the drug are known as ""Sense Offenders,"" and these criminals are tended to by an elite class of soldiers known as Clericks. And by ""tended to,"" I mean ""Terminated with extreme prejudice."" Within the first 20 minutes of the film, we've encountered Clerick John Preston, watched him kill his partner for being a sense offender, and discovered his wife was executed for Sense offenses 4 years earlier. But thanks to his Librium doses, he doesn't seem to mind much. Watching this movie, I suddenly wished they made a drug which made horrible movies good. All is well and good in emotionless Libria, until Preston accidentally knocks a vial of his Librium off the bathroom sink, and doesn't have time to pick up another dose. Suddenly, he is overwhelmed with emotion, and continues to abstain from his medication, leading him to question authority and rebel. And by ""rebel,"" I mean ""Terminate with extreme prejudice."" I suppose you're expecting me to say something along the lines of, ""At this point, the movie degenerates into a Matrix-wannabe."" Unfortunately, the movie was that from the moment Preston and his partner show up to tend to the first lot of sense offenders. Christian Bale was dripping with Keanuosity, from the slicked-back black hair, black garb, and generally emotionless acting ability. Although one would be hesitant to mention the dullness of his performance, given the fact he was on the drug, he"
160,ESS_Doc10_Equilibrium,ESS_Doc10_Equilibrium,ESS,Sci-Fi,Negative,Equilibrium,"Are you serious? Lets think about the basic idea behind the plot of the movie - the simple idea that emotions and feelings are not allowed, and that those in charge, don't have them and will keep all others from having them. At first mention, it sounds like a cool concept. A pretty good idea for a story, and it gets people going - the feeling of not being allowed to feel! But any competent person should be able to immediately realize how absurd this idea is. From it's very conception, the idea for the story is utterly and completely flawed. I'll break it down simply first, then get more detailed. Simply: If there is no emotion, there can be no conflict. If there is no conflict, there is no story. No story, no movie. Or at least, that's what the creators and writers should have realized from the start and this whole project should have died there. But they didn't, and now we need to go into detail and show why this movie just doesn't work: The current rulers of Libria supposedly have no emotion, or at least those that enforce the will of the leaders have no feelings. If they have no emotion, why then do they care if other's do? In order to care, to have the capacity ""to care"", as in feel in-deferent or adversely to another's actions... oh wait, I said it right there - to feel. Therein lies the flaw, but lets not stop there. The most devout follower, Andrew Brandt (played by Taye Diggs), exhibits feelings in more than one instance. Passion, anger, humor, doubt, all of these are shown. He gives a passionate speech to everyone in a room about Preston (Christian Bale), he questions his future, he taunts the protagonist, he shows fear (or feigns it - but to feign would be the product of deceit, and do I really need to explain that as well?) when being dragged away, and above all a point is made to show that he has ambition... A desire to rise in power. Why would a man who can't feel a thing desire power and prestige? And all this from ONE character. The writers and creators present at the beginning of the movie the concept of no feelings, and then completely ignore it throughout the rest of the film. If that first example were not enough, here is another. Taken from the plot summary on Wikipedia: ""Following a standard police raid on a Librian woman, Mary O'Brien, who has stopped taking Prozium..."" If this ""Prozium"" takes away all emotion and feeling, how and why did this O'Brien decide, or even desire, to stop taking it? I don't think I even need to elaborate - it speaks for itself. The entire story is so full of holes I don't understand how it every even got past the conceptual stage. It just goes to show the crappy quality of films being put into production these days. In"

His father was killed in combat under mysterious circumstances and Maverick has spent his life trying to dodge the reputation of his father's ghost. While it has made him try harder than other pilots, it also made him show off his skills by flying recklessly and disobeying orders. When Maverick and his co-pilot, Nick ""Goose"" Bradshaw (Anthony Edwards; ER), are offered the opportunity to attend TOPGUN, the Naval Fighter Weapons School, his cockiness continually gets him in trouble. It also gets him noticed by one of the civilian instructors, Charlotte ""Charlie"" Blackwood (Kelly McGillis; Witness) who wants to learn more about his interaction with an enemy aircraft while on maneuvers. When the two start a romantic relationship, it complicates her position and his training. While Maverick and Goose don't end up winning the Top Gun trophy, Maverick learns to reconcile his feelings about his father to become a better pilot. Top Gun became a surprise hit grossing over 350 million dollars worldwide on a 15 million dollar budget. It also became one of the best-recruiting tools the Navy ever had. Tom Cruise, who had already seen box office success in The Outsiders and Risky Business, became an A list star whose achievements just keep growing over thirty years later. McGillis, Edwards and Meg Ryan (Sleepless in Seattle) were all perfect in their supporting roles but Val Kilmer (Real Genius), as Maverick's nemesis, ""Iceman"", stands out amongst the group going head to head with Cruise. Director Tony Scott (True Romance) brought some incredible shots to the film, mounting cameras everywhere on the fighter jets to achieve amazing footage while giving the audience the feeling they were flying right alongside Maverick, Goose, Iceman and the others. The outcome was exhilarating shots that showed off these multi-million dollar machines. His close up views of Cruise during Maverick's introspective moments helps the viewer understand some of what he was thinking and feeling. Scott's pacing was excellent and his vision was clear. He was the right person to direct Top Gun and part of the reason it became so successful in theaters. The 4K resolution and HDR Dolby Vision enhance the viewing quality of the original film. There are a few moments, especially at the beginning of the film, that doesn't seem all that different but during the flying scenes and with many of the outdoor shots, the uptick in quality is visible. Of course, the video cannot compare to the Dolby Atmos audio, which is top-notch. Everything from the jet engines, to the dialogue and the now-famous soundtrack, is equally strong and crisp. There are two new extras included on the 4K disc while previously released extras are housed on the Blu-ray disc. The extras include: NEW! The Legacy of Top Gun, NEW!

162,BFD_Doc2_TopGun,BFD_Doc2_TopGun,BFD,Action,Negative,Top Gun,"To take it from the top, ''Top Gun'' fires off as spectacular a show of state-of-the-art jet battle as the movies have given us. The F-14 Tomcats soar, swoop and somersault at fantastic speed. They catch the enemy from behind in what seems touching distance, and then, in an instant's reversal, are caught in the enemy's sights. As directed by Tony Scott, with the technical assistance of a couple of former Navy pilots, the snappily edited sequences of battle and mock battle sweep us in and out of the cockpit. You can't always be sure exactly what's going on, but it's exciting anyhow. The excitement is switched off on landing. Once ''Top Gun,'' which opens today at Loews Astor Plaza and other theaters, gets back to earth, the master of the skies is as clunky as a big land-bound bird. The maneuvers of the script by Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr. come right out of the Hollywood book: A cocky, rule-breaking, daredevil superpilot known as ''Maverick'' makes it to the Navy's elite Fighter Weapons School, known as Top Gun. There he engages with a tall, beautiful blond astrophysicist, a specialist in Maritime Air Superiority. He also has experiences that turn him into a better person. Tom Cruise brings little but a good build to the role of Maverick, and the role of the astrophysicist brings little but impossible lines (''When I first met you, you were larger than life'') to attractive Kelly McGillis. The characters don't pair up well; she's much too classy for him. A touch of flavor is added by Anthony Edwards, as Maverick's amiable partner, ''Goose'' (everybody in the Navy evidently has to have a nickname), and the settings and repartee seem about right except when poor Miss McGillis is obliged to lecture on matters like ''negative G pushovers.'' Incidentally, this movie seems determined to break the sound barrier; if it isn't the roar of the jets, it's the roar of Maverick's motorcycle, and when that subsides, there's always the clamor of the music. Effectively executed though the air battles are, they come off as somehow unsatisfying. ''Although we're not at war,'' says a training officer, ''we have to act as though we're at war.'' But not having a real war to fight lowers the stakes, and the climactic dogfight with a batch of MIG's over the Indian Ocean is too contrived, the enemy too vague to elicit the feelings that memorable air-war movies, from ''Wings'' to ''Command Decision,'' could take for granted. And then, there's something about the technical wizardry of today's jets that, for dramatic purposes, diminishes the role of the men who fly them. Despite the movie's emphasis on the importance of the pilots, given all the electronic wonders at their touch - such as being able to lock an enemy plane in their sights and dispatch a missile to chase and destroy it - they seem part of some cosmic technological enterprise. The plot of ''Top Gun'' is no weaker than the"
163,BFD_Doc3_TopGun,BFD_Doc3_TopGun,BFD,Action,Positive,Top Gun,"Some movies are best treated as cinematic souvenirs. Like tacky snowglobes brought back from school trips to Switzerland, or bronze Eiffel Towers with dangerously sharp edges that linger on mantelpieces the world over, worthless and unloved, until they catch someone's eye and remind them of the vanished age from which they came. Top Gun is such a film. Defending it as a work of art would be either brave or reckless. As an historical artifact, though, it's peerless. Like it or not, if you want to know what pop-film was like in the mid-'80s, there's no better example than this chrome-burnished, distilled-to-within-an-inch-of-its-life, high-gloss tale of testosterone-charged flyboys and their big, fast planes. It was, of course, an outrageous hit, and Top Gun contains most of the pan-audience pleasing features that An Officer And A Gentleman (another Simpson / Bruckheimer film, and template for this one) had boasted: a military setting; exciting training sequences; good-looking male lead with a spiffy uniform; a love story; and a competitive element. The formula had worked before, and Simpson was betting it would work again. Top Gun is not so much a movie in the conventional sense as an escalating series of masterfully crafted adverts: motorcycles, aircraft carriers, pectorals and planes all look as if they've been shot for a particularly luminous beer campaign (and while this style looks tired now, it was a revelation at the time). No wonder the American Navy not only provided millions of dollars' worth of hardware gratis, but also stationed recruiting officers outside suburban multiplexes to catch testosterone-addled adolescents still promisingly drenched in cinematic piss and vinegar. For their leading man, Simpson and Bruckheimer had their eye on a promising kid called Tom Cruise. Cruise had been bubbling under as a potential breakthrough star with Risky Business and All The Right Moves. Having just finished filming the mildly troubled Legend - directed by Tony's brother - Cruise (hell, let's call him The Cruiser, this is the '80s) was nervous about Top Gun; even that early in his career he was smart enough to see that the movie had the potential to be, as he put it, ""just Flashdance in the sky"". But Simpson was determined, finally coughing up what would in retrospect be a very reasonable $1 million (Cruise's first) for the 24 year-old. And Simpson was also determined to get his money's worth. When an on-set military adviser pointed out that the majority of professional discourse in navy flight schools did not happen in locker rooms, nor with the flyers clad only in their underwear, Simpson was unimpressed. ""I have just paid a million dollars for that kid,"" he impatiently announced, ""and I need to see some flesh."" And so to the question, ""Is it any good?"" Well, what can be said with certainty is that with contemporary dreck like Van Helsing and Bad Boys II sloshing around the multiplexes (both movies that Simpson would likely have loathed), '80s dreck doesn't look too bad. The flying sequences remain"
164,BFD_Doc4_TopGun,BFD_Doc4_TopGun,BFD,Action,Negative,Top Gun,"Few movies are more ""Totally '80s"" than Top Gun, the smash hit that catapulted Tom Cruise to a new level of stardom. It's the sort of movie that didn't so much capture the zeitgeist as create it, with savvy cross-marketing of a movie that has all the elements for mainstream success: cool action sequences, competition, cocky heroes and the pretty women who love them. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer saw it as ""Star Wars on Earth,"" a moniker just about empty-headed and wrong enough to be right. But for all the critical carping, and there has been much of it over the years, Top Gun endures as an all-time popular movie, with no sign of waning. Quite the contrary: if you believe the rumors, Cruise is being wooed to reprise his role as Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell in a sequel that would hit screens a quarter-century after the fact. Mitchell is a young pilot sent up to the U.S. Navy's elite Fighter Weapons School, known informally as ""Top Gun."" In the film's mythology, ""Top Gun"" signifies an in-school competition only one man can win, and Mitchell (call sign ""Maverick"") is certain he's the best of the best. The hotshot has all the accessories: aviator sunglasses, motorcycle, and well-practiced pick-up routines. But he's met his match in Charlotte ""Charlie"" Blackwood (Kelly McGillis), who (surprise!) turns out to be a civilian contractor evaluating the pilots at the school. She's got a PhD in Astrophysics and she knows better, but she's a sucker for this pilot who throws out the textbook and flies by the seat of his pants. He lives dangerously, and she wants a taste. Screenwriters Jim Cash & Jack Epps, Jr. will not hear of throwing out the textbook, however. Hence the comic-relief sidekick (Anthony Edwards, bringing the requisite energy to empty material) and his perky wife (Meg Ryan), the tough but caring commanding officer (Tom Skerritt), and the personal rival that keeps Maverick in fighting form: Val Kilmer's ""Iceman."" (Also puttering around the supporting cast: Michael Ironside, Tim Robbins, Clarence Gilyard Jr. and Adrian Pasdar.) The story's emotional core comes from Maverick's unresolved feelings about his father, who died under mysterious circumstances about which the c.o.seems to know plenty. Living under his father's shadow, Maverick feels he has something to prove, even if he dies trying. In a weird way, the audience is the beneficiary of this D.O.A. plot, since it pays out in some of the most impressive aerial sequences in screen history, captured with the cooperation of the Navy (and why not cooperate? Top Gun is widely considered the Navy's best recruitment film). So what makes this slick, commercial success so ""totally '80s""? For starters, Kenny Loggins' super-hit ""Danger Zone,"" penned by Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock (the pair won the Best Song Oscar for ""Take Your Breath Away,"" also from Top Gun, also totally '80s). Harold Faltermeyer's synth-y score even got its own single on the smash-hit soundtrack. The script's shamelessly schematic simplicity probably should be more dated than"
165,BFD_Doc5_TopGun,BFD_Doc5_TopGun,BFD,Action,Negative,Top Gun,"Top Gun is an '80s testosterone fix - a celebration of machismo and a recruiting film for the U.S. Navy. Typical of Jerry Bruckheimer/Don Simpson at their peak, the movie embraces masculine tropes to create a patchwork narrative that is almost laughably bad but whose fetishization of high-tech hardware makes the cheesiness of the story seem irrelevant. This is the male equivalent of a Lifetime made-for-TV tearjerker and the passage of the years has greatly diminished it. The aerial stunts and dogfights, which were modestly entertaining in the mid-1980s, come across as borderline-incoherent. Top Gun is all about Tom Cruise. The movie traded on his popularity while at the same time enhancing it - the perfect feedback loop. Prior to this film, Cruise was fast becoming a hot commodity as a result of Risky Business and All the Right Moves. Top Gun would elevate him to the next level, starting a decade of high-profile box office blockbusters. The film also ginned up the careers of producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson, whose previous successes with Flashdance and Beverly Hills Cop were appetizers for what was to come beginning here. Top Gun was a huge success, not only finishing #1 at the box office for 1986 but beating out the #2 title (Crocodile Dundee) by more than $50M. (At a time when $50M was a huge number.) At the center of Top Gun is Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell (Cruise), a classic Hollywood hotshot who's nearly as good as he thinks he is but learns a lesson the hard way. Mitchell and his partner, Nick ""Goose"" Bradshaw (Anthony Edwards), are stationed aboard the USS Enterprise aircraft carrier when they are selected to attend Top Gun (the colloquial name for the Naval Fighter Weapons School). At Top Gun, Maverick finds himself in a not-so-friendly rivalry with Tom ""Iceman"" Kazansky (Val Kilmer) for the Top Gun Trophy. They are put through their measures by instructors Rick ""Jester"" Heatherly (Michael Ironside), who admires Maverick's flying skills but disapproves of his recklessness, and Mike ""Viper"" Metcalf (Tom Skerritt), who sees something of himself in the younger man. Meanwhile, Maverick tumbles into a relationship with Charlie Blackwood (Kelly McGillis), a civilian instructor, who initially rebuffs his advances until eventually having her breath taken away. This is all prelude to a training exercise when things go very wrong and Maverick is left bereft and with his confidence shaken. The movie is a by-the-numbers macho/guy bonding affair with lots of areal footage and a love story thrown in to highlight Cruise's softer side. There's more than a little homoerotic material - whole essays could be (and probably were) written about the shirtless beach volleyball game whose entire purpose is to show off buff, sweaty men. The term ""beefcake"" definitely applies, although one might query the target audience for this sequence. There are no real characters - even those with the most screen time are walking cliches. When the pivotal tragedy occurs, it has zero impact on the viewer. Ultimately, Top"
166,BFD_Doc6_TopGun,BFD_Doc6_TopGun,BFD,Action,Negative,Top Gun,"The jet fumes glow in the dawn's early light as F-14 Tomcats roar into the wild blue yonder from an aircraft carrier based in the Indian Ocean. Lt. Pete Mitchell, a.k. Maverick, is prepared for an uneventful search-and-sight mission when a Soviet Mig-28 swoops down on the American fighter jets. With the Soviet jet breathing down his tail, Cougar, the squadron's leading pilot, starts to sweat bullets. But not Maverick. Prodded by Goose, who's not only his best chum but his backseat radar intercept officer, he zooms in close enough to get a great shot of the Soviet war machine with his Polaroid camera. Disobey an order to land, he goes after Cougar and guides the badly shaken pilot to a safe landing. Maverick's impulsive act of courage earns him a slot at Top Gun, a Navy training school that is designed to separate the real men from the fly boys. Does Maverick have enough of the right stuff of compete with ""the best of the best"" at Top Gun? Will Maverick's romance with Charlie, his curvaceous astrophysics instructor, cause him to crash-land before graduation? The answers to these questions should be obvious. ""Top Gun"" is a carefully calculated reshoot of all those buoyantly patriotic war movies which celebrated the often foolish heroics of gutsy American fighter pilots. If this movie had been made 40 years ago, Maverick would probably have been played by John Wayne or, even, Ronald Reagan. Instead Tom Cruise, a tenderfoot, boyishly appealing actor with a winning Ipana smile, gets to do the honors. When the film was released on May 16, 1986, it actually received mixed reviews from critics. To this day, the movie holds a 56 percent mark from critics on Rotten Tomatoes. Renowned critic Roger Ebert wrote, ""The dogfights are absolutely the best since Clint Eastwood's electrifying scenes in 'Firefox.' But look out for the scenes where the people talk to one another."" Earlier in the review, he wrote, ""[the film] doesn't have a clue as to how two people in love might act and talk and think."" Nonetheless, ""Top Gun"" was the highest-grossing film of 1986. (Mary Evans/Ronald Grant Archive/Everett Collection). Cruise is adorable, but he hardly seems old enough to qualify for the Eagle Scouts. With his leading lady, the serenely beautiful Kelly McGillis, Cruise projects fresh-scrubbed innocence instead of sexual desire and, as a result, their whole relationship seems more like a kid brother and big sister act. So much sexual or dramatic tension: ""Top Gun"" is terribly monotonous. Anthony Edwards gooses things up a bit as Goose, the good natured best buddy. But the rest of the characters are so vaguely defined it's impossible to care about their fate - not even when they engage in an actual battle with Soviet Migs. The movie blithely ignores the incident which appears to be the opening round of World War III and a newly mature Maverick goes back to Top Gun for a final clinch with you-know-who.

Then he flips him the finger and peels off. It's a hot-dog stunt, but it makes the pilot (Tom Cruise) famous within the small circle of Navy personnel who are cleared to receive information about close encounters with enemy aircraft. And the pilot, whose code name is Maverick, is selected for the Navy's elite flying school, which is dedicated to the dying art of aerial dogfights. The best graduate from each class at the school is known as ""Top Gun."" And there, I think, you have the basic materials of this movie, except, of course, for three more obligatory ingredients in all movies about brave young pilots: (1) the girl, (2) the mystery of the heroic father and (3) the rivalry with another pilot. It turns out that Maverick's dad was a brilliant Navy jet pilot during the Vietnam era, until he and his plane disappeared in unexplained circumstances. And it also turns out that one of the instructors at the flying school is a pretty young brunet (Kelly McGillis) who wants to know a lot more about how Maverick snapped that other pilot's picture. ""Top Gun"" settles fairly quickly into alternating ground and air scenes, and the simplest way to sum up the movie is to declare the air scenes brilliant and the earthbound scenes grimly predictable. This is a movie that comes in two parts: It knows exactly what to do with special effects, but doesn't have a clue as to how two people in love might act and talk and think. Aerial scenes always present a special challenge in a movie. There's the danger that the audience will become spatially disoriented. We're used to seeing things within a frame that respects left and right, up and down, but the fighter pilot lives in a world of 360-degree turns. The remarkable achievement in ""Top Gun"" is that it presents seven or eight aerial encounters that are so well choreographed that we can actually follow them most of the time, and the movie gives us a good secondhand sense of what it might be like to be in a dogfight. The movie's first and last sequences involve encounters with enemy planes. Although the planes are MiGs, the movie provides no nationalities for their pilots. We're told the battles take place in the Indian Ocean, and that's it. All of the sequences in between take place at Top Gun school, where Maverick quickly gets locked into a personal duel with another brillant pilot, Iceman (Val Kilmer). In one sequence after another, the sound track trembles as the sleek planes pursue each other through the clouds, and, yeah, it's exciting. But the love story between Cruise and McGillis is a washout. It's pale and unconvincing compared with the chemistry between Cruise and Rebecca De Mornay in ""Risky Business,"" and between McGillis"
168,BFD_Doc8_TopGun,BFD_Doc8_TopGun,BFD,Action,Positive,Top Gun,"In this year of movie multiverses, join me for a moment in the mouth of madness. Imagine a world where the lead role in Top Gun was actually given to Matthew Modine instead of Tom Cruise, and the movie was directed by David Cronenberg. (Who, for the record, has no regrets.) Both of these possibilities were on the table in 1985, when the film was still just a gleam in producer Don Simpson's bleary, red-rimmed eyes. The potential butterfly effects boggle the mind: What if, instead of crooning ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'"" with Goose, Cruise ended up in Modine's role in Full Metal Jacket, narrating Private Joker's descent into a world of shit? What if, instead of guiding Top Gun off the launch pad, Tony Scott had made Cronenberg's The Fly with his stars from The Hunger, David Bowie and Catherine Deneuve? Would we even have Top Gun: Maverick in this timeline? Or Crimes of the Future? What becomes of Kenny Loggins? Speculative fiction is a danger zone. The what-ifs around Top Gun are particularly enticing because they feel so impossible: The movie can exist only in its official form. In addition to being perhaps the quintessential movie of the Reagan era-a snapshot of a Morning in America so bright that everyone has to wear shades-Top Gun was also the most perfectly packaged movie of that time, a masterpiece of ancillary thinking and a landmark in the history of cinematic advertising. In March 1987-almost a year after it opened atop the box office charts and stayed there-it became the first VHS cassette priced to own at under $26.95, effectively rewriting the rules of the then-developing sell-through market while also staking out new terrain in the field of product placement. When Steven Spielberg scattered those Reese's Pieces in E.T.'s path four years earlier, it was a canny act of verisimilitude; the Diet Pepsi ad attached to the home video version of Top Gun, meanwhile, was a crass exercise in blending commercial and cinematic aesthetics, effectively inserting the soft drink into a simulacrum of the film's quick-cut, high-flying imagery. Besides being a time of ""high concept"" plots simple enough to be pitched in a single, excitable sentence, the early '80s marked the moment when movies ceased to be ""just"" movies. In his superlative Star Wars spoof Spaceballs, Mel Brooks mocked this tendency by proposing that ""merchandising"" was the greatest power in the universe, above even the Force (or the Schwartz). The fact that a film like Adrian Lyne's Flashdance played like an extended MTV clip wasn't a bug but a feature, and Scott-who followed his brother Ridley to Hollywood-was part of a cohort of British-bred ad men who instinctively fused storytelling and salesmanship on a molecular level. The commercial that got Scott hired on Top Gun was a Saab spot featuring a car and a jet fighter photographed side by side-a juxtaposition that made it into the movie in the sequence when Cruise rides his motorcycle parallel to a runway strip"
169,BFD_Doc9_TopGun,BFD_Doc9_TopGun,BFD,Action,Positive,Top Gun,"I remember seeing ""Top Gun"" with my buddy Steve when it first hit the theaters in '86. We took Steve's 17-year-old cousin Joshua: a classic, insouciant, gum-snapping, hyper-critical, too-cool-for-school, and definitely too cool for ""Top Gun"" (or so he thought), typical American teen ingrate. Two hours later-that is, two hours of dizzying fighter jet barrel rolls, violent aircraft carrier landings, Sidewinder missile and Vulcan Gatling cannon blasting, and insane levels of fighter jock testosterone later-the kid walked out of the theater with a mile-wide grin on his face. You couldn't shut him up for the entire trip home. A happy, happy boy was Josh. That's what a good war movie does for the male gender who were born with normal levels of God-given testosterone. Young, warrior-talented alphas, with elevated levels of testosterone, go sign up to learn to fly dangerous jets so they can keep America safe. ""Top Gun"" was a game-changer when it came out. Does the military count on that and occasionally fund movies as recruitment ads? Sure. It's called marketing. Why do we need it? America's grown soft. Military service is largely no longer seen as honorable. But we still need the military. As Richard Grenier put it: ""We sleep soundly in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm."" Grenier was actually reformulating something Rudyard Kipling said: ""Men can only be highly civilized while other men, inevitably less civilized, are there to guard and feed them."" ""Top Gun"" kicks off with a hotshot Navy pilot flying inverted, canopy-to-canopy, two feet above a Russian MiG jet. The American pilot's radio intercept officer (the guy in the backseat) snaps a Polaroid of the bogey (enemy pilot) and then extends his middle finger. His pilot then barrel-rolls right-side-up, and vamooses, supersonically. This highly frowned-upon cowboy stunt affords pilot Lt. Pete Mitchell (Tom Cruise) a level of notoriety among his Navy flyboy brethren, as well as in the extended community of Navy personnel with elevated enough clearance levels to be privy to such classified showdowns with enemy aircraft. The upshot is that due to this dust-up, this pilot, call-sign Maverick, and his RIO, call-sign Goose (Anthony Edwards) are selected for the Navy's elite Fighter Weapons School, Top Gun, which is dedicated to honing the aerial dog-fighting skill set, and producing a group that is basically the SEAL team 6 of Navy pilots: the best of the best. The flyboys will compete with each other to win the trophy of becoming the ""top gun."" Maverick's a legacy Navy fighter pilot. His father was a top-notch F-4 Phantom pilot during the Vietnam War, until he and his plane mysteriously disappeared deep in Indian Country, never to be seen or heard from again. And this is the source of the movie's tension: Maverick's deceased dad had gotten a bad rep in the military and had been branded a coward. Maverick's need to prove himself, stand out, and not be lumped in"

After all, what could be a more symbolically appropriate way to rally back from quarantine than an Independence Day IMAX screening of a gaudy, all-American extravaganza that takes place in an alternate universe where the Navy lets 58-year-old men fly fighter jets? Alas, citing concerns with international vaccine rollouts, Paramount moved the movie once again, this time to the week before Thanksgiving - as if anyone wants to watch people play beach volleyball in November. In the meantime we'll have to make do with the original, I guess. That's right, ""Top Gun"" is roaring back to your local AMC theaters this weekend to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the film's release, as well as something called ""Top Gun Day,"" which is one of those meaningless memetic holidays people invent as an excuse to talk about stuff they like on the internet. (Hilariously enough, ""Top Gun Day"" falls a few days before the film's actual May 16 release date because the guys who came up with it made a typo on their merchandise designs.) Remastered in Dolby Vision and Atmos for this reissue, the 1986 movie was also recently made available in a new 4K UltraHD Blu-ray edition, which of course I ran out and bought right away because I find ""Top Gun"" to be politically repellant, logically incomprehensible and aesthetically irresistible. It's a big, dumb movie that was probably bad for the world, and it's also totally awesome. Released six months after Rocky Balboa won the Cold War by defeating Ivan Drago in the ring, ""Top Gun"" offered an even more ecstatic escape into triumphalist, Reagan-era revisionism, removing all the blood, death and despair from combat - replaced by backlit beefcake shots and rah-rah aspirational recruiting mottos about being the best of the best. These clean-cut, freshly scrubbed flyboys weren't haunted war criminals like John Rambo, they're upbeat athletes aspiring to excellence. ""Top Gun"" might be framed around the military, but it's a sports movie through and through. The screenwriters even invented a fake trophy competition and added a locker room to the Navy's elite Fighter Weapons School as a way of reassuring audiences that all this war stuff is just fun and games. Producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer were hot off of ""Flashdance"" and ""Beverly Hills Cop,"" but their stroke of genius here was hiring brash British ad man Tony Scott to direct. A Royal College of Art graduate who'd crashed and burned in Hollywood a few years earlier with his inscrutably esoteric lesbian vampire movie ""The Hunger,"" Scott scored the ""Top Gun"" gig thanks to a car commercial he'd helmed in which a jet plane races a Saab. The kind of blustery, larger-than-life"
171,SGC_Doc1_Taken,SGC_Doc1_Taken,SGC,Action,Positive,Taken,"Taken's greatest asset resides within the perfectly cast Liam Neeson and the deliberate build of his fascinatingly merciless character. Rather than jump directly into the advertised plot, the film is careful to explore the anti-hero's troubled relationships and hint at the dark past that allows him to transform into the ruthlessly efficient soldier requisite for the task at hand. Halfway through the film, when audiences discover to what extent the protagonist is willing to go to accomplish his mission, it's impossible not to be engaged in his brutally unrelenting plight. Former government operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) has retired from his job of long hours and dangerous work in an attempt to reconnect with his estranged daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). But with a restrictive ex-wife (Famke Janssen) and his naturally overprotective impulses, he finds the young woman drifting further away. Not wanting to compound their strained relationship, Bryan reluctantly permits Kim to vacation in Paris, giving her more freedom than he's comfortable with. Things quickly spiral out of control when she's kidnapped by Albanian slave traders from her hotel room. Now, in a desperate and deadly quest, Bryan will stop at nothing to track down those responsible, to save his daughter from the clutches of a depraved organization. Luc Besson certainly has an obsession with shady men with checkered pasts, forced to delve into disturbing criminal underworlds to seek redemption and vigilante justice. Antiheroes come in many styles, and although some critics may scour at unoriginal aspects of Liam Neeson's Bryan, the man still knows how to be a badass. In the rescue of his daughter, he has no limits; this creates many unexpected scenes of exercising an iron will and a frightening determination, which finds a seemingly heroic man donning a guise of villainy. And yet, all of it feels righteous - it's a testament to character design when the hero can remain a hero even after viciously torturing criminals or shooting innocent people to force a few quick answers. He may not be entirely unique, but this hardboiled, unflinching ""preventer"" is simply fixating. ""Taken"" is an action film connoisseur's perfect guilty pleasure. Bubbling over with chase sequences, shootouts (the kind where the baddies supply all the firepower), and fistfights, it takes on a realism not found in many of the action-for-the-sake-of-action flicks of recent years. Bryan's hand-to-hand combat skills don't rely on flamboyant or showy martial arts, instead taking a more realistic approach, with plenty of one-hit takedowns and throat-chops that effectively subdue the enemy in a stealthier manner. The authenticity of it all may be negotiable, but it's refreshing to see simpler forms of attacking and defending - and it's certainly more believable when random gun-toting henchmen aren't prepared with perfect kung-fu fighting techniques to combat the specially trained protagonist. ""Taken"" prides itself on its serious, dark tone. The villains' atrocities are amplified by their detestable trade; they will receive no sympathy from viewers when they get what's coming to them. The hero is also rather remorseless,"
172,SGC_Doc2_Taken,SGC_Doc2_Taken,SGC,Action,Negative,Taken,"If CIA agents in general were as skilled as Bryan Mills in particular, Osama bin Laden would have been an American prisoner since late September 2001. ""Taken"" shows Mills as a one-man rescue squad, a master of every skill, a laser-eyed, sharpshooting, pursuit-driving, pocket-picking, impersonating, knife-fighting, torturing, karate-fighting killing machine who can cleverly turn over a petrol tank with one pass in his car and strategically ignite it with another. We meet Mills (Liam Neeson) in ""sort of retirement"" in Los Angeles, grilling steaks with old CIA buddies and yearning to spend more time with his 17-year-old daughter, Kim. Kim now lives with her mom, Mills' ex-wife and her effortlessly mega-rich husband, whose idea of a birthday present is giving Kim not a pony, but what looks like a thoroughbred. Mills has seen action in Afghanistan and apparently everywhere else, and knows it's a dangerous world for a naive teenage girl. He is against Kim spending the summer in Paris with her girlfriend, even though ""cousins"" will apparently chaperone. He's right. Kim and her pal succeed in getting themselves kidnapped the afternoon of the same day they get off the plane, although Kim has time for one terrified phone call to Dad before she's taken away. Now listen to this. Using CIA contacts at Langley, Mills is able to use his garbled tape of their conversation to determine the name of his girl's kidnapper (Marko), that he is Albanian, that his ring kidnaps young tourists, drugs them and runs them as prostitutes; the virgins are auctioned off to Arab sheiks and so on. Headquarters also tells Mills he has 96 hours to rescue his daughter before she meets a fate worse than death, followed by death. With this kind of intelligence, the CIA could be using bin Laden's Visa card in every ATM in Virginia. It's the set-up for a completely unbelievable action picture where Mills is given the opportunity to use one element of CIA spycraft after another, read his enemies' minds, eavesdrop on their telephones, spy on their meetings and, when necessary, defeat roomfuls of them in armed combat. At one point, a former colleague in the Paris police says he has left seven bodies behind. He's just getting warmed up. How this man and his daughter could hope to leave France on a commercial flight doesn't speak highly of the French police -- and the new ""Pink Panther"" doesn't open for a week. Oh, why does he have only 96 hours? To provide the movie with a handy deadline, that's why. It's always a puzzle to review a movie like this. On the one hand, it's preposterous. But who expects a ""Bourne""-type city-wrecking operative to be plausible? On the other hand, it's very well-made. Liam Neeson brings the character a hard-edged, mercilessly focused anger, and director Pierre Morel hurtles through action sequences at a breathless velocity. If Kim is an empty-headed twit, well, she's offscreen most of the time, and the villains are walking showcases for testosterone"
173,SGC_Doc3_Taken,SGC_Doc3_Taken,SGC,Action,Negative,Taken,"Taken is the latest film from the French film-maker Luc Besson and is about American, ex-CIA agent Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) who turns Paris upside down - 'I'll tear down the Eiffel Tower if I have to!' - in his search for his abducted, 17-year-old daughter, Kim, although, personally, I wouldn't have bothered. Kim is so irritating. Kim is so excitable and such a pampered flouncer to boot. 'Bryan,' I'd have said to him if I could, 'you're better off without her; so excitable and such a pampered flouncer to boot. Now, let's go eat.' But doting dads are doting dads, I guess, and there is just no stopping him, which is a shame, as what follows is a big sorry mess of the most cliched, improbable and xenophobic kind. The film opens in California; happy, sunny California where you are safe because bad, swarthy foreigners can't get to you. That's the feeling, anyway, and it is weird, I agree. After all, Besson is French and Neeson is Irish but there you have it. There must just be no accounting for pro-American fervor and sentimentalism sometimes, although an eye on the box office must help. Anyway, we are introduced to Bryan: big, tough Bryan who has retired early so he can live nearer to and get closer to 'Kimmy', who lives with his ex-wife and her husband, Stuart, a zillionaire. Stuart is always outclassing Bryan. Bryan gives Kim a karaoke machine for her 17th birthday. Stuart gives her a pony. Ouch! That cliche always hurts. And, boy, does Kim squeal excitedly when she sees that pony. Kim, you are already thinking, deserves whatever is coming to her. Bring it on! Lay her out! What is coming to Kim? Well, Kim wants to go on a trip to Paris with her friend Amanda, another pampered babe of the flouncing kind, but daddy won't have it. He knows the world and there are bad people out there, he tells Kim. Hell's bells, they probably lace the croissants with crack in Paris. Still, he eventually consents with strict warnings about phoning every ten minutes. So Kim and Amanda fly off for what would have been a lovely trip had they not been kidnapped by swarthy, sex-slave traffickers the moment they arrive. Seriously, they don't even get a chance to unpack. That's how evil Paris is. We know we are in France, by the way, because all the French men carry baguettes, which is always a sign. Anyway, Bryan's not having it, obviously, and yet as he snaps so does everything else: narrative logic; characterization; believability. When Bryan hooks a girl up to an IV drip in his hotel room, we're meant to believe he always travels with an IV drip and bag of saline to hand? When voice recognition software identifies not just what country the kidnapper comes from, but also what village, in about ten seconds, we are meant to believe that, too?

174,SGC_Doc4_Taken,SGC_Doc4_Taken,SGC,Action,Negative,Taken,"Liam Neeson was up for-but never got to play-James Bond, and now he's getting even. In the violent, churning and laughably derivative action bruiser Taken, he's a suave, power-knuckled and once-lethal secret agent named Bryan Mills who, in truth, is just as mean as 007 but maybe slightly more human (he's an ex-husband, as well as a parent who loves his child unconditionally). And he's paid a price for his fists. Bryan once devoted so much concentration and energy to his job as a ""preventer"" (""I prevented bad things from happening"") that his wife (a wasted Famke Janssen, who usually plays these roles herself) left him for a rich California businessman and took their daughter with them. So Bryan retired, moved to Los Angeles to make up for the frayed relationship with his estranged daughter Kim and sacrificed his own career to be near her. All he does now is grill steaks for his buddies and work occasional security jobs like guarding pop stars at rock concerts. But old habits die hard, and Bryan has forgotten none of the special skills he learned from his years with the C.I.A.-a knowledge of weapons, wiretaps, deciphering secret codes, scaling buildings like Batman and wiping out anything that gets in his way without regret-if he suddenly needs them. When his virginal 17-year-old (huh? In L.A.?) embarks with her girlfriend on a whirlwind tour following the rock group U2 across Europe and, within hours of her arrival in Paris, gets kidnapped by Albanian white slavers, Bryan shifts into demolition mode and takes no prisoners. He may be a has-been, but within 96 hours he's torn down everything in Paris with his bare hands except the Eiffel Tower. First, he leaves a message on the kidnappers' cell phone, which just happens to be lying under the bed where his daughter is hiding: ""I will look for you. I will find you. And I will kill you."" He does, of course, but not before he slam-dunks his way through the City of Light, turning it into darkness. Equipped with Uzis, knives, swords and even an electric chair, Bryan works without official supervision or an expense account, yet never seems to run out of steam or cash. And there is no limit to his ability to tap international phone lines, spark the ignition in foreign cars without keys and find new ways to torture and kill his victims. In one scene, when he fails to get the right answer from a man strapped to a chair in the middle of a brutal interrogation, he electrocutes him, filling the room with smoke, fire and the smell of burning flesh. Each new victim (including some of France's leading power players) only piques the simmering rage of a vengeful parent, and we all know that a dangerous secret agent with a mission makes for panic in the streets. Turning the tables on master fiends, police officials and their families, ransacking Paris for clues, Bryan ends up in a shootout on"
175,SGC_Doc5_Taken,SGC_Doc5_Taken,SGC,Action,Negative,Taken,"NEXT out of the January dreg-u-lator: A Liam Neeson thriller so lacking in ambition they should have called it ""Paycheck."" ""Taken,"" one of those Frenchy efforts to do an American-style chase-'em-down and shoot-'em-up, comes from formerly respectable producer Luc Besson and director Pierre Morel, whose homegrown, low-budget action thriller ""District B13"" was a lively little collection of stunts. In trying to broaden their scale to interest a big American audience, Besson and Morel are as convincing as Marcel Marceau doing John Wayne. Neeson plays a retired ex-spook trying to mend fences with the teen daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), he had with his ex-wife (Famke Janssen), who is still bitter about being neglected during his career as an international undercover agent. We learn that Neeson's Bryan left his teammates in the middle of a mission in Beirut so he could fly 9,000 miles to attend one of his daughter's birthday parties. So which is it: Was he distant or dedicated? And why do his ex-mates think he's such a great guy if he disappears every time he wants to go wrap a present? Bryan is a growly killin' machine trying to find his daughter after she is kidnapped on a trip to Paris. To find his way, he uses a road map of cliches: moldy dialogue (""I will find you. And I will kill you""), improbable escapes from teams of incompetent henchmen (just shoot him in the head, guys - don't handcuff him to a loose overhead pipe) and one of those only-in-the-movies sofas that is bulletproof and fluffy at the same time. When the machine guns roar, just get behind one of these babies and watch the air fill with soft, pretty flurries of stuffing. Available at Crate & Gunbarrel. The movie has two tasks: One is to track Neeson's every step as he pieces together the mystery of where his daughter is. The other is to stage cool chases and gunfights. Both the action and the mystery scenes, though, are made up of such choppy, sloppy, laugh-till-you-drop-y elements that I couldn't figure out whether the movie was rushing through the fights to get back to the mystery or vice versa. An example of how the mystery plays out: Bryan plays a tape of a snippet of conversation between his daughter's attackers to one of his fellow spies. The spy tells him that the men are speaking Albanian, identifies what town they're from, guesses what their game is (trafficking in women to turn into prostitutes) and even explains who their crime boss is. I wish I had a Basil Exposition of my own to decode Neeson's accent. The Irish actor chews over his words as though speaking through a mouthful of mashed potatoes. After half an hour, it dawned on me that he might be trying to sound American, although I couldn't be sure. ""You need my permission to leave the coontry?"" he asks. The fights and chases are so scrambled that it's hard to figure out basics such as"
176,SGC_Doc6_Taken,SGC_Doc6_Taken,SGC,Action,Negative,Taken,"Any parent could relate to Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), the retired super-spy at the center of Taken. All he wants is what's best for Kim, his 17-year-old daughter (Maggie Grace). Divorced from her mother and overshadowed by her filthy-rich stepfather, he would, he says, ''sacrifice anything for her.'' Specifically, he would kill each and every scum he meets in Paris. The number he does on the City of Lights is comparable, corpse-for-corpse, to any damage wreaked by Jason Bourne. With one key difference: Jason has a conscience, or wishes he did. Bryan has none. I mean none. The only life that means anything to him is Kim's, and when she gets nabbed by Albanian sex traffickers on a trip abroad, Bryan hops on a plane and lays waste to gay Paree. ""You can't just run around tearing up Paris!"" whines a French colleague (Olivier Rabourdin). Au contraire, Bryan says: ""I'll tear down the Eiffel Tower if I have to."" Clench-jawed action star is a new gig for Neeson, but the Man Who Was Schindler has long worn the mantle of heroism. The twist this time is an utter lack of moral complexity. He's a dad, and he's a killing machine, and that's it. This blindered characterization makes for a driving premise and a few interesting scenes, but it gets to be a bore after the shock wears off. If he'll kill or maim just about anyone, where's the suspense? It's less Neeson's fault, or even director Pierre Morel's, than the movie's co-writers: Robert Mark Kamen and the entertainingly shlocky Luc Besson, who also produced. The Besson-Kamen writing team gave us The Fifth Element, all three Transporters and, most recently, a little Norwegian-Mexican comic Western called Bandidas. They're just the men for high-gloss knockabout bloodshed. So Bryan shoots people. He knifes them. He snaps their necks, sprays them with hot steam and chases them onto highway ramps where they're conveniently smooshed by oncoming traffic. He electrocutes a guy for information, then flips on the switch and leaves. He wings a lady whose only crime is cooking him a nice chicken dinner - and being married to the wrong man.The film's single most effective scene is the tense trans-Atlantic sequence when Kim, on the phone with her father, sees her airhead friend (Katie Cassidy) abducted in a Parisian flat and realizes the kidnappers are coming for her next. As Bryan instructs his daughter to scream identifying characteristics (height, hair color, tattoos) into her cell, the camera looks squarely at Neeson's pale brow and watery blue eyes. He doesn't cry; his face is gripped not by immobilizing grief but by pragmatism, professionalism and the need to act immediately. After he arrives in France, there's a bit of quirk with a fellow hired to translate Albanian. What a nifty touch - hey, Bourne never hired a temp. For a minute there, movie begins to approximate real-world logic. But then Bryan starts arguing with the Albanians in English, and they argue back in English, and"
177,SGC_Doc7_Taken,SGC_Doc7_Taken,SGC,Action,Positive,Taken,"Liam Neeson flashes a telltale Harrison Ford smirk a couple of times near the start of Taken, which helps explain why this bracingly effective thriller is getting the January cast-off treatment. The film has already been released almost everywhere else but North America - it first opened in France last February - and the major critical knock is that it looks like something Ford would have done 20 years ago. Something like Frantic, in fact, the 1988 movie in which Ford's character rousts Paris in search of his kidnapped wife. The comparisons are apt - Neeson's character rips through Paris for his kidnapped daughter - but you'll miss out on a good movie if you consider Taken just another January dumping. It's more of a thumping, as Neeson lays bare his action-hero chops. The quiet Irishman doesn't often get a chance to go on an extended tear, but when he does, you need to sit back and watch in amazement. He's ex-CIA ""preventer"" Bryan Mills, who has recently moved to Los Angeles from Virginia to be more of a dad to his 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). His dedication to his job cost him his marriage to Kim's mother, Lenore (Famke Janssen), and he's trying to make up for parental lost time. Lenore isn't buying it, and she's now happily involved with a tycoon (Xander Berkeley) who is so determined to spoil Kim, he even buys her a pony. It does seem that Bryan is having trouble leaving the rough life behind: he busts a few moves, and heads, while on a freelance protection job for a pop diva (Holly Valance). Bryan's knuckles and pistols more than come in handy, though, when Kim and her pal Amanda (Katie Cassidy) travel to Paris on vacation, against Bryan's better judgment, and are immediately kidnapped. Bryan learns from his former CIA pals that the girls have been snatched by Albanian pimps, who seek slave prostitutes, and there's a window of no more than 96 hours before the teens disappear into the underworld forever. A ticking clock within a thriller usually means a bomb is about to go off, and that accurately describes Bryan. To say that he hits the ground running is almost an insult to physics. He is the Tasmanian Devil of trackers. Do not doubt him when he calmly tells the kidnappers, via Kim's purloined cellphone, ""I will look for you. I will find you. And I will kill you."" The bodies stack up like jets at a busy airport as Bryan gets down to brutal business, improvising as he goes. Neeson has a marvelously expressive face that contains rage like a bottled tornado. He also conveys the empathy needed for us to endure lots of violence and unfortunate ethnic stereotypes (Arabs are particularly maligned) of this blunt instrument of a film. Who couldn't identify with a father's determination to save his daughter? Taken is from Luc Besson's genre factory, which explains why France got it first and why it bristles"
178,SGC_Doc8_Taken,SGC_Doc8_Taken,SGC,Action,Positive,Taken,"So many movies are well intended but poorly made that when something like ""Taken"" comes along, it's a relief, almost a joy. There's nothing lofty in the intentions of ""Taken."" The aspiration here was to make a simple, straight-ahead action thriller. Period. But if you think that's easy, think of all the lousy action thrillers that come out in the course of a year. The level of skill that went into ""Taken"" is masterly. This is a picture that will appeal mainly to people who love movies, and I use the word ""love"" advisedly. Viewers who love movies for their true soul - for their obviousness, for their manipulations, for their corniness, for their blend of high and low emotion - will take great pleasure in ""Taken."" Others, who like movies conditionally, like a wayward lover they hope to reform, may end up hating ""Taken"" - or at least thinking of it as something stupid, ridiculous, far-fetched and worthless. In terms of pace and economy, it's beautiful to behold. Director Pierre Morel, working from a script by Robert Mark Kamen (""The Fifth Element"") and Luc Besson, knows when to slow down and lavish time on characters to establish the emotions and motivations that are going to give the action its urgent undercurrent. Liam Neeson plays Brian, a nice, easygoing fellow whose main mission in life, as the film starts, is to rekindle a relationship with his teenage daughter. Apparently, he was a workaholic who neglected his family and wrecked his marriage, but he's determined to keep that one flickering connection alive and thriving. Oh, yes, and it turns out that he's a former CIA agent. Of course he is. What did you think, that this movie was going to be some boring thing about a family? Wake up and smell the explosions! So what happens next? How do the screenwriters connect the dedicated-father angle with the former CIA-agent angle? Three guesses. ... What, you only needed one guess? That's right, the daughter is taken and borne away by an international cabal of criminals. Anyone could devise this premise. The real measure of ""Taken"" is not in what happens but in how it happens. Observe, for example, the intelligent construction of the abduction scene. Notice how the design of the apartment (from which the girl is taken) and the use of the victim's perspective contribute to the tension. Take note of the sheer cleverness of the filmmakers' choosing to have it all happen while the girl is on the phone, and how that phone conversation builds the sense of dread and excitement. It's as if the filmmakers, at every turn of the script, said, ""OK, this is how it's usually done. Let's come up with a way that's better. Then let's throw that out and come up with something that's even better than that."" There are different kinds of creativity. ""Taken"" evinces the creativity of expert craftsmanship. Neeson is well cast as a softhearted, thoughtful, self-effacing man who is big enough"
179,SGC_Doc9_Taken,SGC_Doc9_Taken,SGC,Action,Positive,Taken,"It's so hard to find good, disreputable thrills anymore. So many contemporary action movies are built around semi-plausible, politically charged premises, like keeping plutonium out of the hands of this or that evildoer from somewhere in the Middle East. It's gotten impossible to find a villain who's just, say, a good, old-fashioned Albanian prostitute wrangler -- just a real bad guy, someone out to make a profit by wholly immoral means, with no underlying political or religious motives that we must struggle to understand. For those kinds of tawdry kicks, thank god we have writer/producer/nutball Luc Besson. ""Taken"" is the latest hyperkinetic chicken to emerge from the semi-cracked egg that is Besson's brain: He co-wrote the picture with Robert Mark Kamen, and it's directed by Pierre Morel, who previously made the exhilarating French cult hit ""District B13"" (also written and produced by Besson). In ""Taken,"" Liam Neeson plays Bryan Mills, a former CIA operative who has retired from a lifetime of covert ops to build a relationship with his 17-year-old daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), whose childhood he missed, thanks to his devotion to his job. His icy ex-wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen), now remarried to some superrich guy (played by Xander Berkeley), thinks it's too late for Bryan to make amends and does all she can to keep him away from Kim. But then Kim gets the chance to go to Paris with some friends -- because she's underage, she needs Bryan's permission to travel overseas. Lenore assures him Kim will be fine, but his former line of work has made him all too aware of the terrible things that can happen out there in the world, especially to a giggly teenager whose travel wardrobe includes a sequin-studded jacket that screams, ""Look! I'm a clueless American tourist!"" Bryan finally, and reluctantly, complies, giving Kim a preprogrammed cellphone and urging her to keep him apprised of her whereabouts. The movie's title -- as well as its trailer, if you've seen it -- gives away what happens next. But that doesn't really matter. The delirious and sometimes nasty little pleasures that ""Taken"" offers don't hinge as much on surprise as they do on the action (which is crisp and fast, with a minimum of computer enhancement) and on the story's unabashedly sentimental underpinnings. This is one of the things I love about Besson, whose work, I'll concede, is sometimes both flashy and pointless. He's been the string-puller behind some lousy movies as well as some extremely fun ones Besson is unafraid of sentimentality, to the extent that he sometimes goes overboard with it. But Morel keeps ""Taken"" moving swiftly. It's never dragged down by excess feelings; instead, it's powered by the potency of the right ones. Much of the credit must also go to Neeson, a fine actor who is also often, unfortunately, extremely dull. His performance in ""Taken"" is anything but: It's big enough to fill up the screen but not so oversized that you end up giggling at it. He finds"
180,SGC_Doc10_Taken,SGC_Doc10_Taken,SGC,Action,Positive,Taken,"A little actioner called Taken, is now tops at the box-office and deserves a quick hosanna. Taken is a short, punchy B-movie, countering the ever-longer and more brooding big-budget action spectacles we've been seeing for a while now. Their new one, Taken, is an old-fashioned vigilante film about a father rescuing his daughter from sex slavers who will, naturally, die in droves. The formula is freshened up with some unlikely casting: Liam Neeson as the lethal dad. Neeson is one of those stodgy respected actors, Irish, obviously, and with all sorts of classic stage roles and prestige pictures to his credit. He's an odd fit for the part of an ex-CIA American with an impressive homicidal skill-set who's given it all up in order to repair his relationship with his teenage daughter (Maggie Grace). But it works pretty well. Neeson is sad-faced and lumbering and low-wattage, which is great for the early scenes when he goes through the ritual everyday-life humiliations that will key us all up to watch him do maximum damage later. He lives in a crap apartment in L.A., and he's scorned by his gratuitously mean ex-wife and her rich buffoon of a second husband. Some action fans will wonder if we needed to see quite so much corny daughter-love and cringy dad-humiliation before getting to the action. It IS a little weird, the lingering thoroughness of the set-up. But it makes sense in the long run. They're piling it on in the old-melodrama style, so that when the daughter finally gets abducted while on a trip to Paris, by evil Albanians yet, the violent payback can be unleashed with a whoosh. When I saw it, you could hear the whole audience settle tensely in their seats, as if to say, ""Okay, NOW it's on."" Because Neeson is big and slow-looking-in certain shots he looks like Frankenstein's monster's handsome brother-there's a real pleasure in seeing him break somebody's face swiftly and efficiently. He can run, too, with a sort of speeding-train heftiness. And he looks invariably stoic, with a nice middle-aged melancholy in his creased face. He's even reasonable a lot of the time. If they'd just give his daughter back, everybody could walk away. But they won't. And this begins to irritate him. At one point, he shoots somebody who's pleading, ""Wait, we can nego-!"" It was great to be back in the atmosphere of intense audience involvement after seeing so many films viewed in the dutiful stupor produced by ""quality"" cinema. There's a scene in Taken when Neeson gets jumped, and we all groaned ""Ohhhh!!"" in unison. If there had been time to warn him, someone probably would've shouted, ""Look behind you!"" There can be no question that movies like this are built to give an adrenaline rush that's stoked, in part, by bitter resentments, crude old prejudices, and weird lusts. All that daughter-love, for example, devolves into some very peculiar scenes like the one when the girl's virginity is being auctioned off to zillionaire"
181,SEG_Doc1_Inception,SEG_Doc1_Inception,SEG,Action,Negative,Inception,"Christopher Nolan is the new Stanley Kubrick. That's the gist of many of the rave reviews currently circulating in the American press in the wake of his new, brain-teasing sci-fi thriller. Nolan gained critical success early on with Memento, then hit the other kind of jackpot with the Batman franchise. Now, with Inception, which he wrote as well as directed, he seems to have the whole world at his feet. Which is apt, because the central characters in Inception dabble in ""pure creation"" and, as a result, feel ""like gods"". To start at the beginning - which, naturally, is a false start - the film is set in a cut-throat future. Separated from his kids thanks to a crime he (possibly) didn't commit, Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is employed by a corporation to steal ideas from people while they're sleeping. His latest victim, Saito (Ken Watanabe), turns the tables and demands that Cobb plant an idea in the mind of Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), who is heir to a business empire that is on the brink of world domination. If Cobb can convince Fischer to break up this empire, Saito will pull strings so that Cobb's ""crime"" is overlooked. Cobb assembles a crack team, including unflappable boffin Arthur (Joseph Gordon Levitt), mischievous forger Eames (Tom Hardy) and earnest undergraduate Ariadne (Ellen Page). She is to be the team's ""architect"", creating a dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream that Fisher will at all times accept as ""real"". There are two problems. Fischer has been trained to resist brain infiltration. And Cobb's own demons are running amok in the subconscious realm - a runaway train and a noirish dame (Marion Cotillard) seem to have it in for our man. Cobb insists he has things under control but, as Arthur deadpans, ""I'd hate to see you out of control."" Inception is the kind of information-packed movie that creates the painful/pleasurable sensation that there's no time to think. There's a whole new vocabulary to be mastered (""projections"", ""kicks"" and ""totems""). Your ears are bombarded, and not just by Hans Zimmer's indignantly doom-laden score, but by in-jokes, such as the playing of Edith Piaf's Je Ne Regrette Rien, which was sung by Cotillard in La Vie en Rose. Your eyes, if they are to catch clues like the design of a certain passport stamp, would be advised not to blink. The ideas that Nolan is toying with are deliciously meta-textual. Key characters are suffering from what literary critics like to call The Anxiety of Influence, the fear that they are someone else's creation and that original thought is impossible. Which begs the question, how original is Inception itself? Nolan's narrative borrows from such other navel-gazing gems as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Cronenberg's eXistenZ, Soderbergh's Solaris and Richard Linklater's Waking Life. It flat-out plunders The Matrix, the guilt-laden Don't Look Now and everything Philip K Dick has ever written. It's got a wee bit of Citizen Kane in there, too. But none of that gets in the way of"
182,SEG_Doc2_Inception,SEG_Doc2_Inception,SEG,Action,Positive,Inception,"It's said that Christopher Nolan spent ten years writing his screenplay for ""Inception."" That must have involved prodigious concentration, like playing blindfold chess while walking a tight-wire. The film's hero tests a young architect by challenging her to create a maze, and Nolan tests us with his own dazzling maze. We have to trust him that he can lead us through, because much of the time we're lost and disoriented. Nolan must have rewritten this story time and again, finding that every change had a ripple effect down through the whole fabric. The story can either be told in a few sentences, or not told at all. Here is a movie immune to spoilers: If you knew how it ended, that would tell you nothing unless you knew how it got there. And telling you how it got there would produce bafflement. The movie is all about process, about fighting our way through enveloping sheets of reality and dream, reality within dreams, dreams without reality. It's a breathtaking juggling act, and Nolan may have considered his ""Memento"" (2000) a warm-up; he apparently started this screenplay while filming that one. It was the story of a man with short-term memory loss, and the story was told backwards. Like the hero of that film, the viewer of ""Inception"" is adrift in time and experience. We can never even be quite sure what the relationship between dream time and real time is. The hero explains that you can never remember the beginning of a dream, and that dreams that seem to cover hours may only last a short time. Yes, but you don't know that when you're dreaming. And what if you're inside another man's dream? How does your dream time synch with his? What do you really know? Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a corporate raider of the highest order. He infiltrates the minds of other men to steal their ideas. Now he is hired by a powerful billionaire to do the opposite: To introduce an idea into a rival's mind, and do it so well he believes it is his own. This has never been done before; our minds are as alert to foreign ideas as our immune system is to pathogens. The rich man, named Saito (Ken Watanabe), makes him an offer he can't refuse, an offer that would end Cobb's forced exile from home and family. Cobb assembles a team, and here the movie relies on the well-established procedures of all heist movies. We meet the people he will need to work with: Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime associate; Eames (Tom Hardy), a master at deception; Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a master chemist. And there is a new recruit, Ariadne (Ellen Page), a brilliant young architect who is a prodigy at creating spaces. Cobb also goes to touch base with his father-in-law Miles (Michael Caine), who knows what he does and how he does it. These days Michael Caine need only appear on a screen and we assume he's wiser than"
183,SEG_Doc3_Inception,SEG_Doc3_Inception,SEG,Action,Negative,Inception,"Talk of Christopher Nolan's latest film Inception seems inescapable; the buzz alone propelling the film into the top spot opening weekend. Granted, the only notable competition was Disney's truly dreadful Sorcerer's Apprentice. Inception isn't doing The Dark Knight numbers at the box office, but in a summer of uninspired remakes, reboots and franchises, it doesn't have to. Wildly derivative-evoking The Matrix, Minority Report, 2001: A Space Odyssey and several mediocre heist films not worth mentioning-Inception seems downright revolutionary when compared to the rest of the dreck being screened in neighborhood multiplexes this summer. 1. Inception is very long. Despite being four minutes shorter than Nolan's 2008 outing The Dark Knight, Inception, clocking in at a punishing 148 minutes, feels much longer. Distracting expository detours, which often derail the story and painful repetition are the chief culprits here. Forty minutes of footage could have been jettisoned without adversely altering the film's story or visual impact. 2. Shocker! Female characters are poorly utilized. I counted four female characters in the films, two of which had barely more than a few lines. The remaining two-Academy-Award nominee Ellen Page and Academy-Award winner Marion Cotillard-are tasked with the thankless job of serving as plot devices or emotional mirrors for Dicaprio's Dom Cobb (who is written with the emotional depth of a piece of lightly buttered toast). Cotillard's beauty, maturity and soulful depth (remember, this is the actor who won an Oscar playing Parisian icon Edith Piaf) exist to suggest similar qualities of Cobb. Page's presence works to make Dicaprio seem older; doing a much better job than Dicaprio's fuller face (he seems to fill out when a role requires him to appear aged), creative make up and access to an array of what appear to be his grandfather's suits. Inception requires little of its talented female leads; it is unsurprising the film is tracking poorly with older audiences, particularly women. Expecting nuanced female characters in a Christopher Nolan film is about as fruitful as expecting the same from a Kubrick film. Nolan's films haven't managed to position women in thoughtful or empowered ways. In Inception, the women exist to provide the audience with analysis of the male lead, lacking individual motivations for their actions, thoughts, and feelings. 3. Ken Watanabe and Cillian Murphy give the strongest performances of the film. There is already Oscar talk about Inception and to be fair, most of it is not warranted. It's a great film, but it's definitely not Oscar caliber, the Academy's bias against sci-fi notwithstanding. Even the dazzling visual effects borrow from more interesting films. That said, Watanabe and Murphy offer interesting performances in Inception, completely inhabiting the construct while also infusing their characters with the desperately needed humanity devoid from many of the other characters. 4. Enjoyment of Inception requires lowered expectations. Whatever preconceived notions one holds regarding Inception you're better off leaving them at home. Inception is a tricky piece of cinematic machinery, which can both thrill and frustrate-often at the same time. To mitigate"
184,SEG_Doc4_Inception,SEG_Doc4_Inception,SEG,Action,Positive,Inception,"Inception's inspiring imagination and ingenious innovation are still as staggering and stimulating today as they were ten years ago. Following the blowout box office success of 2008's The Dark Knight (which grossed $535.2 million domestically and $1.1 billion worldwide) and the rampant raves it received (culminating in a posthumous Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Heath Ledger), Christopher Nolan was finally rightfully recognized as the adept auteur he had always been, gaining commendation from crowds and critics across the globe. Though Nolan was no freshman filmmaker - having made several acclaimed indies from 1998-2002 (Following, Memento, Insomnia) and beginning his blockbuster blitz with 2005's Batman Begins - The Dark Knight turned him into a national name, with Sue Kroll, president of Warner Bros.' worldwide marketing, even stating that ""Christopher Nolan [was now] a brand."" While the world waited with bated breath for Nolan's conclusion to his brilliant Batman trilogy, he had another project in mind he wanted to pursue before going back to Gotham City. Nolan initially pitched the idea for the intricate and inventive Inception to Warner Bros. back in 2001, but he wished to acquire more awareness on how to best bring ""larger-scale"" films to life before officially tackling this twisty tale; with two big-budget Batman flicks under his belt, the time had come to make his delirious dreams a reality (both literally and figuratively) and begin constructing his most complex chronicle yet. We have a little less than a month to wait until Nolan's eleventh feature film, Tenet, hits theaters (scheduled for Wednesday, August 12th), but to coincide with both that picture's first release date and Inception's 10th anniversary, the seventh edition of ""Flashback Films"" is dedicated to revisiting Nolan's ballsy 2010 blockbuster and investigating its influence on innovation in cinema over the past decade. Given that Tenet is seemingly quite similar to Inception in scale, scope, and story, there's no better way to put your anticipation for Nolan's latest effort at ease than by joining us to analyze one of his greatest achievements. Originally envisioned as a horror-tinged heist film about ""dream stealers,"" Nolan soon realized that Inception's plot lacked ""personal"" stakes and emotional investment; in a movie centered around memories and the mind, this was an obvious oversight. For the next nine to ten years, Nolan strained to smooth out his script, soon settling on a story that told of a ""dream thief"" named Cobb (to be played by the legendary Leonardo DiCaprio) who was called upon by a client to assemble a crew (composed of actors such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy) that could pull off the converse chore of instead planting an idea in an influential C.E.O.'s subconscious - this procedure would come to be known as ""inception."" Just as Inception's narrative follows its protagonists' twisty travels through ""dreams within dreams within dreams,"" Nolan additionally fine-tuned the film to jump from genre to genre to genre throughout its running time. When analyzed from afar, one can see that Inception has the"
185,SEG_Doc5_Inception,SEG_Doc5_Inception,SEG,Action,Positive,Inception,"After the release of Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" back in 2010, I wrote a review on my earlier blog site praising the film. After several more viewings, I would continue to applaud this production and it was easily my favorite film of that year. But as excited as I was over ""Inception"", I still don't think my previous review did justice to what has become one of my favorite movies of all time. Yes, I said of all time! I still find ""Inception"" to be one of the most original and most ambitious movies I've ever seen. But ambition doesn't always equal a great movie. ""Inception"" not only aims high but it succeeds in creating a brilliant and unique picture that's unlike anything I've seen. It's hard to pigeonhole ""Inception"". It's a heist film, a tragic romance, science-fiction, and an action film. But the best thing is it uses all of these ingredients flawlessly. The bulk of its success can be traced right back to Nolan. For my money Christopher Nolan is one of our greatest working directors. He wrote , co-produced, and directed this film and I truly believe he's one of the only visionary filmmakers who could have pulled this off. It took him almost ten years to write and rewrite the script and it took the huge success of ""The Dark Knight"" to secure the big budget needed to make ""Inception"". But you sure can't argue with the results of the finished product. ""Inception"" ended its box office run making over $825 million worldwide. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, an actor Nolan had wanted to work with for some time. He plays ""Dom"" Cobb, a dream thief for lack of a better title. He, along with his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), are paid to infiltrate the subconsciouses of their targets via their dreams and steal information. When the dream extraction from a wealthy Japanese businessman named Saito (Ken Watanabe) goes wrong, Cobb and Arthur find out they were being tested. Instead of extracting information, Saito wants the them to attempt inception on a business rival of his. The idea of inception is that instead of stealing information you plant it in the target's subconscious while they're dreaming. There are questions as to whether inception is even possible but Cobb is enticed to take the job when Saito promises to use his influence to clear Cobb's name of a mysterious murder charge that has kept him out of the United States and separated from his two children. To do the job Cobb needs a top-notch team of experts. Eames (Tom Hardy) is basically a forger or probably better described as an impersonator. Once inside a dream he has the ability to take on the identity of anyone. Ariadne (Ellen Page) is the architect. She is able to construct mental labyrinths inside the dreamers subconscious. This is essential if the team is going to know their way around the dream. Yusuf (Dileep Rao) is basically the team's pharmacist. He's the"
186,SEG_Doc6_Inception,SEG_Doc6_Inception,SEG,Action,Negative,Inception,"Christopher Nolan, the British-born director of ""Memento"" and of the two most recent Batman movies, appears to believe that if he can do certain things in cinema-especially very complicated things-then he has to do them. But why? To what end? His new movie, ""Inception,"" is an astonishment, an engineering feat, and, finally, a folly. Nolan has devoted his extraordinary talents not to some weighty, epic theme or terrific comic idea but to a science-fiction thriller that exploits dreams as a vehicle for doubling and redoubling action sequences. He has been contemplating the movie for ten years, and as movie technology changed he must have realized that he could do more and more complex things. He wound up overcooking the idea. Nolan gives us dreams within dreams (people dream that they're dreaming); he also stages action within different levels of dreaming-deep, deeper, and deepest, with matching physical movements played out at each level-all of it cut together with trombone-heavy music by Hans Zimmer, which pounds us into near-deafness, if not quite submission. Now and then, you may discover that the effort to keep up with the multilevel tumult kills your pleasure in the movie. ""Inception"" is a stunning-looking film that gets lost in fabulous intricacies, a movie devoted to its own workings and to little else. The outer shell of the story is an elaborate caper. Leonardo DiCaprio, with a full head of golden hair and a touch of goatee, plays Cobb, an international thief. Not a common thief, but an ""extractor"": he puts himself to sleep, enters the dreams of another person, then rummages around and steals something important that pops out of the sleeper's unconscious-an industrial secret, say. Saito (Ken Watanabe), the head of an enormous Japanese energy company, hires Cobb to go beyond extraction to inception; that is, not to steal an idea but to plant one that the dreamer will think is his own. Just like Danny Ocean preparing to crack a safe, Cobb assembles a larcenous crew, who will enter the mark's dreams with him. There's a dream architect, Ariadne (Ellen Page), who can create convincing interior worlds, so that the dreamer will think that everything is real. There's a forger, Eames (Tom Hardy), who, in the dreams, can embody any person known to the dreamer. There's a chemist, Yusuf (Dileep Rao), to drop both the team and the target into deeper layers of sleep with a super-sedative. And there's a kind of dream manager, a demanding, unimaginative sourpuss named Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), to insure that the fantastic sting comes off. There's also a wild card. Cobb's dead wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), keeps jumping out of the lower reaches of his mind bearing a knife or a gun and crashing into the created dreams. Cobb is still in love with her, and feels guilty about something he did to her. Occasionally, he takes a rusty old elevator down to his subconscious and visits her. Cotillard, with her amber coloring, is ravishing and tear-stained, and, if you"
187,SEG_Doc7_Inception,SEG_Doc7_Inception,SEG,Action,Negative,Inception,"Writer-director Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" is about an espionage expert, Leonardo DiCaprio's Dom Cobb, who has a highly specialized way of stealing corporate secrets: He extracts them from within the dreams of his targets. Depending on your taste for narrative logic, Nolan's penchant for delineating dream states carries either a built-in advantage or a huge liability. If you don't mind being tossed about in a state of high confusion for 2-1/2 hours, as dreams enfold within dreams and subconscious states are poised in an infinite limbo, then this is your dream movie. I found myself more inclined to sympathize with Cobb's notion that, in limbo states, hours can turn into years. After one too many dreams-within-dreams-within-dreams, I was feeling in limbo myself. Which is not to say that ""Inception"" isn't a compelling thrill ride. It's just not much of a fun ride. Nolan, best known for his ""Batman"" movies and the time-shifty ""Memento,"" is very big on noir. For him, black is beautiful - i.e., horrible. When Cobb starts hunting dream worlds, he never encounters anything transcendent inside anybody's noggin. The darkness of this movie, as was also the case with Nolan's ""Dark Knight,"" is magisterially oppressive. Cobb's situation, despite its newfangled presentation, is fairly conventional, even sappy. Once upon a time he became a fugitive from America for supposedly causing the death of his wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard, who, coming after Michael Mann's ""Public Enemies,"" is Hollywood's designated noir vamp). Mal keeps invading his dreams, or the dreams he concocts within other's dreams-within-dreams, or their dreams within his dreams, or - oh, forget it. Anyway, she's up to no good, even though, technically, she's dead, or in limbo, or something. The point is, man-with-a-past Cobb is still in love with her. She is, literally, the woman of his dreams. His enraptured state is scaled big, Wagnerian big, but neither he nor Mal can quite fill out the ardor. That's because Nolan, ultimately, is a head guy and not a heart guy. He's all about architecture. Everything in this movie issues from the heavy doominess of its look. Things lighten up ever so slightly when Cobb, hired by a Japanese tycoon (Ken Watanabe) to do some heavy-duty extraction - excuse me, inception - on a corporate heir (Cillian Murphy), assembles his A-Team of fellow dream foragers, including Ellen Page's Ariadne, master forger Eames (Tom Hardy) and sidekick-researcher Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). But even here, Cobb too often spoils the party by offering up such deep-think pronouncements as ""we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential."" I cite this line, which is typical - not to mention unoriginal and probably untrue - because many people are going to be conned into thinking ""Inception"" is some sort of high-I.Q. whirligig just because it's festooned with Mobius strips and M.C. Escher stairs and everybody in it seems to understand what's going on even if you don't. (The biggest, the only, laugh line at my screening came at a particularly confusing time when Ariadne"
188,SEG_Doc8_Inception,SEG_Doc8_Inception,SEG,Action,Negative,Inception,"Director Christopher Nolan is such a master movie technician -- a combination of engineer, architect, game designer and God -- that it's startling to realize how constricted his vision is and how clumsily he tells stories. ""Inception,"" Nolan's first film since his mega-googolplex hit with ""The Dark Knight,"" and his first as a solo writer-director since the now-legendary puzzler ""Memento"" in 2000, is supposed to be a dreamscape movie. At one point, in fact, we travel with its central Scooby-gang of characters into a dream within a dream within a dream, and then into some deeper, still more unconscious, psychological limbo-state below that. Managing all these nested levels of narrative is a marvelously nerdy accomplishment, no doubt -- but this is the most tight-assed vision of the innermost human psyche I've ever seen. While Nolan's images are visually impressive and powered by state-of-the-art digital effects and accomplished stunt work, they're always ordered and organized with anal precision. They don't look or feel anything like dreams. (Or, at least, not like my dreams.) They look instead like mediocre action films from the '90s, or in the case of the supremely boring ski-patrol vs. Arctic fortress shootout found on Level Three, like the Alistair MacLean adaptation ""Ice Station Zebra"" from 1968. (With Rock Hudson! And Ernest Borgnine!) ""Inception"" may have been directed by Christopher Nolan, but Nolan's dreams are apparently directed by Michael Bay. OK, I know -- you want me to back off the high-minded analysis and tell you whether ""Inception"" is a good destination for those summer moviegoing dollars eager to leap out of your wallet. Sure, I guess so. It's a cool-looking action movie, carefully constructed and edited, that uses all kinds of nifty locations and a lot of portentous-sounding expositional yammering. It inhabits a Philip K. Dick-style universe of psychological warfare that suggests ""The Matrix,"" ""Total Recall"" and ""Minority Report"" -- all of them, by the way, better movies -- but it's fairer to call ""Inception"" a maze movie or a labyrinth movie than a puzzle movie. Because, as the wisecracking fellow critic sitting next to me observed, every time the story gets puzzling the characters call a timeout and explain it. So, yeah, if you approach ""Inception"" with lowered expectations it's a pretty good time. Problem is, there are no lowered expectations around Christopher Nolan, whose adherents have proclaimed him as the heir to Kubrick and Hitchcock and declared ""Inception"" a masterpiece. I don't want to get sidetracked here, but let me suggest that the comparisons aren't entirely misguided. They're just not helpful. Nolan has inherited some of Kubrick and Hitchcock's worst tendencies, most notably their defensive, compulsive inclination to work everything out about their stories and characters to the last detail, as if human beings and the world were algebraic or geometrical phenomena requiring a solution. But the mysterious power of Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" cannot be explained by the ludicrous official story revealed in the final act -- indeed, it nearly scotches the whole movie -- and"
189,SEG_Doc9_Inception,SEG_Doc9_Inception,SEG,Action,Positive,Inception,"Christopher Nolan returns to the audacious concepts and narrative trickery of Memento with this slippery and cerebral summer blockbuster. Last night I dreamt I saw Inception, Christopher Nolan's dizzying tale of a gang of thieves who infiltrate the sleep of their victims, stealing ideas and whipping up mischief. Who knows: maybe it really happened. The trouble with Nolan's film is that it pulls so many tricks and double bluffs that it is often hard to get your bearings. And so, like the movie's characters, we are left to blunder blindly down the rabbit hole, labouring to tell the ceiling from the floor and wondering desperately, in the words of one protagonist, ""just whose subconscious we're in now, exactly"". Happily, in the case of Inception, getting lost is half the fun. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Cobb, a haunted corporate ""extractor"" who accepts a mission to plant an idea in the head of billionaire industrialist Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy). So far, so perplexing, except that Nolan is only getting started. On gaining access, the gang discovers that Fischer's subconscious has been ""militarised"" and is now primed to defend itself. Worse, the gang's assignment is constantly threatened by the appearance of Mal (Marion Cotillard), a ghost from Cobb's past who is here re-imagined as a knife-wielding angel of vengeance. Before long, Ellen Page's bright young helpmate twigs what's happening. ""The deeper we go into Fischer,"" she explains to Cobb, ""we also go deeper into you."" But what an electrifying trip this turns out to be. Full credit to Nolan for at least laying out some ground rules before he yanks away the props. Inception unfolds as a kind of metaphysical heist movie: a Thomas Crown Affair of the senses. It takes its various dream states and arranges them like Chinese boxes, one within the other and each running to a different clock, like Narnia. In dreamland, it transpires, five minutes last an hour and a kingdom can be won or lost in the time it takes for a van to flip off the road. But the momentum of the van still finds a way to percolate down through the levels. In one bravura set piece, the guests at a sterile business hotel are forced to brace their legs against the wall as the whole building lists lazily to one side. Over recent years, Christopher Nolan has made his millions at the helm of the Batman franchise. But Inception marks a return to the audacious concepts and narrative trickery of his 2000 breakthrough, Memento. It is that rarest of beasts: a slippery, cerebral summer blockbuster that slaloms from illusion to reality and back again and leaves its viewer bewitched, bothered and bewildered. Possibly Nolan's film is finally too slick and quick for its own good. Perhaps it is fated to lose a little impact and logic when scrutinised later, in the cold light of day. But let's not quibble. The acid test is whether it works in the moment, in the dark, in the"
190,SEG_Doc10_Inception,SEG_Doc10_Inception,SEG,Action,Positive,Inception,"Writer/director Christopher Nolan is a brainy filmmaker, no doubt about it, but I'm not sure he's a terribly philosophic one. Inception, Nolan's first film since the eye-rollingly overpraised The Dark Knight, is a mind-bender bearing superficial resemblance to other question-reality manifestos like The Matrix and Synecdoche, New York, only minus the giddy pop psychology of the former and the me-myself-and-I (or is that ""the It, the I, and the Over-I""?) self-seeking of the latter. Strip away Inception's central conceit - that humans can experience shared dreams, and that nefarious deeds may take place while we're poking around in one another's subconscious - and what you're left with is, in essence, a heist movie, with all the familiar tropes of the genre: a conflicted leader who behaves immorally, but for righteous reasons; his assembled team (here, temperamentally and ethnically diverse); and that one last job that almost certainly promises our hero's undoing. DiCaprio plays Cobb, the lead of a crew that traffics in a unique kind of corporate espionage in which they design a dreamscape, then trap, say, a CEO into said dream in order to extract highly sensitive, highly profitable information. That's what the team usually does - extraction - but early on, they are hired to do the opposite: to plant an original idea in the head of an heir to an energy conglomerate (Murphy). Inception is unproven - though not untested, Cobb grimly suggests - and in order for it to work, Cobb's team determines they will have to go much further than a shared dream, but rather, into a dream within the dream within the dream. That means that at one point, Nolan thrillingly juggles in tandem almost a half-dozen loci on the time-space continuum... and that's why you can't discount the novelty and dazzling invention of Nolan's premise. Certainly he's an able action director, but via this dream anti-logic, he's written himself full license to hurl his film into exotic, often otherworldly locales defined by an altogether other kind of physics. Hurl, indeed: While there is, of course, that typically Nolanesque self-possessedness to the film, what endures is its sense of desperate tumult as worlds collapse, multiple ticking clocks go off, and a broken man tries, badly, to make reparations. Hans Zimmer's characteristically assaultive score strikes the right tone: While logic tells us nothing could be less life-and-death than what happens when we dream, experience tells us otherwise. The terrors and ecstasies of our dream lives feel just as vivid, if not more, than what happens outside of REM. The problem with Cobb is that he can't tell the difference anymore. DiCaprio's Cobb isn't so far removed from his shaky and grieving antihero of Shutter Island - and does the actor have some kind of contract rider dictating bronzer and an undernourished Van Dyke beard? - but his blend of unflappable cool and spittle-sob emotiveness is irresistible here. The rest of the actors are hardly afforded backstories, but Nolan has cannily cast a terrific assemblage of"
191,TJH_Doc1_Angelhasfallen,TJH_Doc1_Angelhasfallen,TJH,Action,Negative,Angel has fallen,"The sleepy, dopey action bonanza ""Angel Has Fallen"" is disappointing, and not just for the reasons you might expect. Being the second sequel to ""Olympus Has Fallen,"" ""Angel Has Fallen"" doesn't even have a high bar to clear. ""Olympus Has Fallen"" was a by-the-numbers revenge-fantasy about ruthless North Koreans and emasculated, savior-thirsty Americans that's mostly distinguished by its considerable displays of over-the-top violence. Basically, America is graphically imperiled for the sake of confirming a slogan coined by then-interim President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman): ""As a nation, we are never stronger than when we are tested."" ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is, at the very least, a credible survivalist wet dream. In that movie, America is (temporarily) made great again, but only after the Washington Monument is toppled, the President is tied up, and the Secretary of Defense is punched in the face and kicked in the belly, right before she's dragged across the floor as she defiantly screams the Pledge of Allegiance. To defeat the North Koreans, Banning does what no officially sanctioned US agents can: he kills a bunch of bad guys without any remorse or reprisal, like the North Korean hostage that he shoots in the head, just to spook the other North Korean agent he has tied up (""Your friend seemed like a funny guy""). ""Olympus Has Fallen"" isn't a good movie, but I couldn't stop watching it. By contrast: I couldn't wait to stop watching ""Angel Has Fallen,"" an indifferently assembled cash-in shot with way too many shaky, unfocused close-ups which seem designed to re-assure viewers of this otherwise bland drama's surface-deep intensity. Being a timid lament about contemporary American trust issues (the Russians are to blame, but almost incidentally), ""Angel Has Fallen"" sics Banning-now rickety from concussion-induced migraines and insomnia-on a group of disloyal American mercenaries led by, well, you'll figure that part out soon enough. The makers of ""Angel Has Fallen"" don't seem to care as much about their characters (or patriotic ass-whoopings) like their predecessors did. Instead, we get a few tentative signs of introspection from Banning-he's sick, has a family to protect, and an estranged dad, too!-that are immediately glossed over for the sake of pumping up a few flat set pieces that hail from the Tony Scott School of Frenzied Action Filmmaking, only they're not as dynamic or good-looking as Scott's jittery photography. If you're going to be mean-spirited and exploitative, at least do it convincingly. The makers of ""Angel Has Fallen"" struggle most when they have to make Banning look like a rebel who also knows that he must inevitably ""ride a desk"" to retirement. Their version of Banning is more like John McClane in ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" than in ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder."" He complains (and periodically shows symptoms) of the action-movie equivalent of PTSD, but never succumbs to those ailments, especially not when he needs to cut through handcuffs, light up a phalanx of armed mercs, or run away strategically. This is apparently what life is like"
192,TJH_Doc2_Angelhasfallen,TJH_Doc2_Angelhasfallen,TJH,Action,Negative,Angel has fallen,"""Angel Has Fallen"" marks the third time that Gerard Butler, as the Secret Service agent and scowling samurai cowboy Mike Banning, has had to rescue the President of the United States from an international conspiracy so cuckoo bananas that the movie barely expects you to believe it. (Actually, in the six years since this series launched, the bar for what people will believe has been lowered. For all I know, fans of the ""Fallen"" films think they're based on true stories.) In ""Olympus Has Fallen"" (2013) and ""London Has Fallen"" (2016), the president was portrayed by Aaron Eckhart, who came off like a testy press secretary from the ""West Wing"" days. (Eckhart is a good actor with a terse appealing manner, but he's not exactly presidential.) In ""Angel Has Fallen,"" the role of Leader of the Free World reverts back to Morgan Freeman, who has played it approximately 47 times - or, at least, it feels that way. Seeing him back in the Oval Office is as comfy and reassuring as slipping into a daydream where Barack Obama is still president. Banning is now getting on a bit, suffering from chronic pain caused by a concussion and other woes he secretly medicates, lest anyone, from his wife (Piper Perabo) to the president, ask him to quit. He's in line for the job of director of the Secret Service, but it's a desk jockey gig. Butler's squint tells you how he feels about that one. The plot - which is to say, the plot against the president - is, once again, a violently overwrought confection of ""topical"" comic-strip ludicrousness; that's the DNA of the ""Fallen"" series. Yet when you're watching a big-budget B-movie, there's good preposterous and there's bad preposterous. Good preposterous is the setup of ""Angel Has Fallen"": Banning, the most loyal and trusted agent of President Allan Trumball (Freeman), is out guarding him on a winter afternoon fishing excursion when a vehicle pulls up in the woods and launches what looks like a flock of black birds. They are drones, equipped with smart bombs and computerized facial-recognition software, and as they fly low and target their prey, the explosions pile up with a satisfyingly surgical but relentless precision. In minutes, the 18 Secret Service agents hovering on the shore are all dead. And Mike? He's alive because the drones purposefully avoided him. He pulls Trumball under the water, and the result of this action is that the president is soon laying in a coma in a Washington, D.C., hospital. Mike, after a brief spell of unconsciousness himself, escapes, and it doesn't take long for the film to tell us what we already know: that he was spared by the bad guys so they could make him the fall guy. With its over-the-top premise set in motion, ""Angel Has Fallen"" - as in, the president's guardian angel is out of commission - gets down to the business of asking us to suspend our disbelief in far less entertaining ways. If"
193,TJH_Doc3_Angelhasfallen,TJH_Doc3_Angelhasfallen,TJH,Action,Negative,Angel has fallen,"There comes a time when every action franchise has to take a long, hard look in the mirror. Three films in, the ""Fallen"" franchise seems to have finally done that, concluding that xenophobia might not be the greatest look in 2019. The series has so far been marked by ghoulish jingoism: Olympus Has Fallen opted for full-blown paranoia, with its story of villainous North Koreans hijacking the White House, while London Has Fallen was rife with Islamophobia (it's still hard to believe that the line, ""Get back to F***headistan or wherever it is you're from,"" made it to the final cut). While the third installment in the franchise, Angel Has Fallen, is still a loud, ultra-violent, ugly-looking film, you can feel a guilt weighing heavily on its creators. As a result, it's unexpectedly self-reflective. Namely, our hero, US secret service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), is finally seeing his exploits catch up with him. A doctor has cautioned him that the headaches and insomnia he's experiencing are probable signs of spinal cord damage. There's only so much more stress his body can take. Banning is left torn between his near-psychotic attachment to pursuing danger at every cost (""We're lions and that ain't never gonna change"", an old friend of his from the army says) and the cushy desk job being dangled in front of him by his boss, President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman). But that's a decision that he'll have to worry about later, after Trumbull becomes the target of a coordinated drone attack that leaves his entire security entourage dead. That is, except for Banning, who swoops in at the last moment to save the president's life. With Trumbull left in a coma, the FBI immediately pin the crime on Banning and he's forced to go on the run, track down the real culprit, and clear his name. Angel Has Fallen has, for some reason, modelled itself on Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, as Banning tracks down the father (Nick Nolte) who abandoned him many years ago and who now lives in a booby-trapped cabin deep in the woods, far away from ""Big Brother"". Nolte is admittedly great in the role, marking the first time these films have had a genuine sense of humour and character, as he moves through the world like a delusional, dirt-encrusted Santa Claus. And while Butler is still playing the gruff action hero he's always been, his moments with Nolte feel light and spontaneous enough that you could be momentarily convinced he was a real, human person. The film's script (written by Robert Mark Kamen, Matt Cook, and director Ric Roman Waugh) never goes beyond vague anti-war statements - Banning's father notes that it makes no difference whether it's Iraq or Vietnam, all wars wreak havoc on a soldier's soul. But as these two men - both feeling past their prime - share their gripes and grumbles, it provides a welcome change of pace from the non-stop action that dominates the rest of the"
194,TJH_Doc4_Angelhasfallen,TJH_Doc4_Angelhasfallen,TJH,Action,Negative,Angel has fallen,"Ric Roman Waugh's Angel Has Fallen sees U.S. Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler)-having returned to his home turf after a trip across the pond-contending with more threats to international security. Mercifully jettisoning the Islamophobia of Babak Najafi's London Has Fallen, the film finds Mike framed for an assassination attempt on President Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman). And clearing his name appears to hinge, at least at first, on whether or not he learns to grapple with the physical and psychological toll of his previous exploits, as multiple concussions and spinal injuries have saddled him with insomnia and an addiction to painkillers. As a fleet of miniature drones slaughters Trumbull's security detail, it's impossible not to think of Mike's early interactions with his old Army Ranger buddy, Wade Jennings (Danny Huston), the head of a private military contractor. Angel Has Fallen introduces Wade openly lamenting that Trumbull's efforts to stop war profiteering have hurt his business. It's almost to the film's credit that Jennings's guilt is never in doubt, meaning that Mike's subsequent escape from custody and quest to clear his name are rooted solely in his having to contend with his traitorous friend's private army, and not some dull mystery centered around who set him up. Still, the film's framing of Mike as the most wanted man in America is clumsily executed. Given that his face is plastered on screens all over the country, you'd think that the man would be trying to avoid public exposure at all times. In practice, though, Mike is almost always in plain sight, never making any attempt to disguise himself, almost as if he's aware that no one ever seems to recognize him. The only exception to this rule is when he's held up by two armed, backwoods militiamen in Angel Has Fallen's most baffling scene; after all, when one imagines the sort of people who might be driven to an outraged citizen's arrest over an attack on a liberal, black president, one doesn't immediately think of white nationalists. Given the lack of significant impediment to Mike's movements, the film allows plenty of space for action thrills, but Waugh seems to have cobbled his set pieces together from a series of close-ups edited as if by random selection. And because of so much coherence-defying shot continuity, it's impossible to tell what's happening during any given skirmish. Even the nonviolent scenes are jittery and aggressive; a close-up at one point tracks a character picking up a phone with a whip pan so fast that the shot slips out of focus. Worst of all, though, are the special effects that mark the more grandiose set pieces, with smoke from massive explosions hanging statically in the air as a giant, solid mass and, in the film's rooftop climax, the obvious use of green screen revealing image artifacts around the actors' faces. It doesn't help that, three films into the Fallen series, Mike has almost paradoxically lost some of his dimensionality as a character. In an age"
195,TJH_Doc5_Angelhasfallen,TJH_Doc5_Angelhasfallen,TJH,Action,Negative,Angel has fallen,"Hollywood's most ridiculous franchise has been revived. That would be the ""Fallen"" series. You know, the one where doughty Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) previously pulled the presidential fat out of the fire in 2013's ""Olympus Has Fallen"" and 2016's ""London Has Fallen."" Battling North Korean terrorists, who besieged the White House and took the president hostage in ""Olympus"" (reducing the executive mansion to rubble in the process), and Muslim terrorists, who briefly captured the president and trashed significant sections of London in the ""London"" installment, our man Mike seems like the embodiment of bad juju when it comes to protecting the prez. And you wonder: How does this guy keep his job? One imagines the following conversation in the Oval Office. President: ""So who's the lead agent in my protective detail today?"" Aide: ""Mike Banning, sir."" P: ""Nooo! Get him away from me!"" Followed by Mike's reassignment to the Secret Service's newly created office in Point Barrow, Alaska. That ought to keep him out of trouble. But nooo-body has apparently learned their lesson about the guy. So Banning is back on duty in ""Angel Has Fallen."" And sure enough, catastrophe ensues. A mass attack of killer drones puts the president (Morgan Freeman, taking over the role from Aaron Eckhart) in a coma and Mike in handcuffs, accused of masterminding the high-tech assassination attempt. He's been framed, of course, by mysterious forces who don't remain mysterious for long. Director-screenwriter Ric Roman Waugh and co-writers Robert Mark Kamen and Matt Cook barely bother to keep the audience guessing as to who's up to no good here. Instead, the main emphasis is on orchestrating the expected car chases, gunbattles and massive explosions. Waugh, a former stunt man, has an affinity for scenes in which flaming blown-up bodies are sent soaring skyward. With seemingly everyone on the planet hunting him, Banning has to somehow evade capture and single-handedly bring the evildoers to justice. Butler looks a little puffier this time, as though Banning's past adventures have taken a physical toll on him. And the writers have given the character certain impairments - insomnia, PTSD, etc. - that make him a bit more vulnerable than in the earlier movies. Freeman's president spends a lot of the picture in a comatose state but, when he's up and about, he's calm, quiet-spoken and dignified. You know, presidential. Or at least as presidents have been customarily portrayed in movies in the past. A bearded Nick Nolte is on hand, playing Banning's paranoid, government-hating Vietnam vet dad; Tim Blake Nelson is weaselly in the role of the vice president; Jada Pinkett Smith is snappish as a tough FBI agent; and Danny Huston is smoothly villainous as Banning's one-time best buddy turned baddie. ""Angel Has Fallen"" plays out exactly as you would expect from a potboiler of this type. No surprises here, other than that it exists at all. It's the kind of movie one expects to be released at the shank end of summer. Time to"
196,TJH_Doc6_Angelhasfallen,TJH_Doc6_Angelhasfallen,TJH,Action,Positive,Angel has fallen,"Angel Has Fallen may not be appreciably better than the first two installments of this lower-middle-range Mission: Impossible wannabe franchise, but it's actually more fun - first and foremost because of a vastly amusing turn by Nick Nolte as Gerard Butler's eccentric Vietnam vet old coot father. Outfitted with a dizzying body count and robust R-rated mayhem, this late summer action entry brandishes a small war's worth of bloody violence and heavy artillery to lure boys young and old to theaters, where the 2013 and 2016 entries both landed in the $200 million box office range worldwide. The first thing you can't help but notice is that Butler is getting a bit puffy around the gills as he pushes 50; not only that, but the president's personal Secret Service macho man Mike Banning is experiencing disorienting dizzy spells that suggest that a move from the field to a desk job may be in order. Still, it doesn't take long for Banning to once again prove that one of him, however diminished he may be, is worth a dozen of anyone else when it comes to protecting the President of the United States, who, in a bit of wish-fulfillment fantasizing, is played by Morgan Freeman and not, let's say, by Alec Baldwin. In an elaborate set piece notable for its body count, President Allan Trumbull's entire security staff is wiped out while protecting the chief executive during a fishing expedition not far from Washington; only his personal bodyguard, Banning, manages to keep the president alive during this frightful onslaught by what look like brilliantly trained mercenaries. But what thanks does he get for his heroism? Instant blame for the whole bloody fiasco from Vice President Kirby (Tim Blake Nelson), who insists that Banning is in cahoots with the Russians, has him charged with the attempted murder of the president and is immediately sworn in as acting president. From here, screenwriters Robert Mark Kamen, Matt Cook and Ric Roman Waugh - the latter of whom also directed, as he did on the previous series entry - clearly spent most of their creative energy figuring out multiple ways in which Banning could wriggle out of seemingly inescapable predicaments, get caught or subdued again, then bust his way out to fight yet another day. Kirby's first hours as president don't go very well, as Banning slips through his fingers in short order. Waugh's background is as a stuntman, and he no doubt put a lot of his old cohorts to work on this one; bodies go flying every 20 minutes or so, as Banning at one point escapes in, of all things, a big rig, and you begin to think you're bearing witness to the reincarnation of Hal Needham. It's all utterly preposterous, and yet Waugh handles the big scenes pretty well, or at least well enough (and with sufficient self-aware humor) that you're willing to go along with Banning's mad attempt to elude the traitors and save the country from servitude to Russian-backed"
197,TJH_Doc7_Angelhasfallen,TJH_Doc7_Angelhasfallen,TJH,Action,Positive,Angel has fallen,"Angel Has Fallen, opening this weekend courtesy of Lionsgate, is a curious political retcon. After two films that, implicitly or explicitly, seem targeted at the stereotypical Fox News viewership, this third film offers a mostly conventional action-adventure movie with politics closer to the MSNBC demographics. The film offers not a story of Americans under attack from scary foreigners but of a nation in danger from rich white dudes who would prefer to keep up the status quo of perpetual war for the sake of their own defense contracts. Simply put, if London Has Fallen was season six of 24, then Angel Has Fallen is closer in spirit to season 2, when the (black) president had to face down a government that wanted to go to war even under false pretenses. Say what you will about Jack Bauer's cultural legacy, but 24 was doing ""the Iraq invasion is a bad/immoral idea"" stories in early 2003, right as the war was beginning, way before it was safe or cool to do so in mainstream entertainment. While this seem more spoiler-y than I'm accustomed to being in a pre-release review, much of this is revealed in the first act. Besides, once Danny Huston shows up in the opening scene, you know what to expect. The movie doesn't even treat his ""reveal"" as a baddie as any kind of plot twist. I'm sure Mr. Huston is a lovely human being in real life, but, as an onscreen actor, he is arguably the least trustworthy man in the history of Hollywood. In terms of plot, all you need to know is that Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) is on the verge of getting a major promotion, but he's hiding issues stemming from work-related injuries and has taken to popping pills and visiting doctors on the sly to avoid worrying his co-workers and his family. After a drone attack nearly kills the president (Morgan Freeman, giving a fine Morgan Freeman performance), Banning finds himself blamed for the attack and forced to pull a Dr. Richard Kimble in order to clear his name and protect his country. He also eventually runs into his estranged survivalist father (Nick Nolte), who offers some key aid while providing a counterexample for why a desk job may not be the worst thing in the world. Anyway, Angel Has Fallen strips away much of the Die Hard tropes from the first two installments, even as its politics and ""Who are the baddies and why are they being bad?"" plot comes straight out of Roland Emmerich's painfully underseen/underrated White House Down. Yes, just as London Has Fallen copied the general plot structure (the hero secret service agent rescues the president and the two of them avoid the bad guys and save the day) of the other 2013 ""Die Hard in the White House"" movie, Angel Has Fallen has now co-opted its politics. The core story, the hero being framed for an attack on the people he has sworn to protect and forced to go"
198,TJH_Doc8_Angelhasfallen,TJH_Doc8_Angelhasfallen,TJH,Action,Positive,Angel has fallen,"It's almost three years into the Donald Trump administration, and Morgan Freeman is still playing the president. That's not the usual way this goes. Usually, movies depicting the president choose an actor resembling the sitting president. Dick Crockett was a balding, football-loving president in ""The Pink Panther Strikes Again"" (1976), made during the Gerald Ford administration. Bill Pullman was a youngish, light-haired president, like Bill Clinton, in ""Independence Day."" Dennis Quaid was positively W.-like in ""American Dreamz"" (2006). And Jamie Foxx practically imitated Barack Obama in ""White House Down"" (2013). This tradition is so common that movies sent into production prior to an election sometimes try to anticipate the winner. Thus, ""Hunter Killer,"" released this past January but filmed in the summer of 2016, depicted the president (Caroline Goodall) as blond and female. Yet in the face of that tradition, ""Angel Has Fallen"" has chosen not to go with a Trump-like actor in the president role - as if Gary Busey couldn't do a New York accent! Instead they've elevated Freeman to the highest office. He played the speaker of the House in the previous movie in this franchise, ""London Has Fallen."" But why eschew Trump? One guess: Perhaps they thought a Trump-like actor wouldn't be sympathetic, or believable. Or perhaps they knew that just the idea of Trump is so contentious that no one in the audience would be able to think of anything else. Supporters would consider no portrayal good enough, and detractors would consider no portrayal bad enough. In any case, whoever made this decision did the right thing, because they have a good movie here, albeit one that feels grounded in an alternate-reality America. It's saying something when it's a toss-up trying to determine which world seems more screwed up, the one onscreen - with about a thousand drones attacking the president while he's out on a lake, fishing - or the one we live in. As the movie starts, our hero, Secret Service Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), is tired. He has been at it since ""Olympus Has Fallen"" in 2013, and he is suffering from migraines and insomnia. He's too old for this kind of thing. And then come those drones, filling the sky like an angry flock of birds, and raining down explosives on the president and his entire Secret Service detail. The only one not targeted is Banning, and that's because he's been set up by the conspirators to be the fall guy. For most of ""Angel Has Fallen,"" the president is in a coma, the vice president is running the government, and poor Mike is on the run, trying to find the would-be assassins before he is captured. He's basically an escaped Lee Harvey Oswald, except he really is a patsy. Eluding capture would seem impossible, but the filmmakers concoct a series of situations that, if not believable, are so entertaining that we're happy to accept them. Right up there in the far-fetched-but-fun department is Nick Nolte, who turns up as"
199,TJH_Doc9_Angelhasfallen,TJH_Doc9_Angelhasfallen,TJH,Action,Positive,Angel has fallen,"Gerard Butler's U.S. Secret Service Agent Mike Banning is in rough shape at the start of Angel Has Fallen. He's got a sore shoulder, a couple of compressed vertebrae, and a case of tinnitus that rivals Pete Townsend's. It's all led to an increasing dependence on painkillers that he keeps secret from his wife (Piper Perabo, taking over duties from Radha Mitchell) and his boss, the President of the United States (Morgan Freeman). But as weary as Banning might be, if you believe the Tomatometer scores of the previous two installments of the action saga we now call the ""Fallen Trilogy,"" he is still doing better than a film critic who has had to review all three. Many seem incredulous that these examples of what has been called ""terror exploitation"" are still alive and kicking-unlike, say, any Secret Service agent who has the misfortune to pull a shift with Mike Banning. But when you remove Angel Has Fallen from the context of the previous films and take into account Mike's battered state and that he spends much of the film wrongly accused of masterminding an assassination attempt on the president, what you have is a noir for our age of technological paranoia and all-encompassing militarism. Like the first film, Angel holds you in its tight and often illogical grip. At once, it numbs you with its onslaught of body-disintegrating explosions and kill shots while stoking your fears about military-industrial conspiracies and evil infiltrating the government at the highest level. It is a doom-invoking, cathartic and strangely satisfying head-trip that's also a bit ridiculous. Directed by one-time stuntman Ric Roman Waugh-also a co-writer on the script-Angel Has Fallen shows us a world where militarism and a militaristic stance has informed every aspect of both the natural order and the social compact. That apparent cloud of bats swarming over the lake where the president is fishing? It's actually a collection of tiny drones that can identify who you are before blowing you to smithereens, as it does to Banning's 15-man security crew. A stop at gas station turns into a run-in with truckers who have dubbed themselves a militia and tote military-style guns but have no clue how to use them. Even a respite at an off-the-grid West Virginia cabin that is home to Banning's estranged father Clay (played by a delightfully game Nick Nolte) reveals a structure with both state-of-the-art surveillance and a complicated warren of tunnels. It's also wired with enough explosives to topple a small village, implying a world where a woods-bound recluse could purchase that much destruction as easily as he could buy milk. When the explosives are detonated at the hands of the seemingly doddering Nolte, the audience laughed-an indication that it was meant to be one of the film's few jokes. This is a movie that speaks more eloquently in explosives than it does words. In the eye of it all is Butler, who is sturdy and generic; he's like a movie star you could pick"

You pull over at a rest area and, no, gross, you aren't going to poison your bowels with Burger King, so you crunch down on that non-chain grilled chicken caesar wrap and it's like, hey, these tomatoes actually taste fresh, this dressing isn't globbed on, and there's a smidgen of care in the sear of these chicken strips. These bright moments are nothing to dismiss in life, and it's my major takeaway from Angel Has Fallen, a movie I barely knew existed 24 hours before I ended up in its weirdly captivating thrall. I saw 2013's Olympus Has Fallen, not that I remember it too well, and I skipped the sequel London Has Fallen, but I swear you don't need to have seen either of them. Gerard Butler, looking more and more like Russell Crowe's baby brother, is Action Hero Man in the guise of a secret service agent. He's the best there is, like Rambo but pro-government. He and the President (Morgan Freeman) are pals. Standing next to the leader of the free world on a fishing boat is technically work, but he likes it. Why not? They are bros and they've been through two action movies together. But trouble is brewing. Thanks to one exploded grenade in his face too many, Butler (whose character's extremely regular name is Mike Banning, but may as well be Chest Steel or something) has headaches and can't sleep. His wife (Piper Perabo) wants him to pack it in and ""ride a desk"" but his old army buddy/bellicose defense contractor with his own private killsquad college (Danny Huston) knows he'll never give up the job. Indeed, the two men sit in Adirondack chairs one evening, mooning over the good ol' days like they are ex-ball players, not warriors-for-hire who machine gun helicopter pilots until they are enveloped in flames. One day, Mike Banning is out with the Pres on his vacay and, like those weird balloons from the British series The Prisoner, very smart drone-bats appear over a lake, eviscerating the entire secret service detail. ""Holy shit!"" exclaimed the man next to me, who got into the screening for free. The President comes very close to dying in a fire, but Mike Banning saves him. He doesn't save himself, though, because we see the murderbats' POV (computers!) and his name was on a white list. He was never a target. There's something fishy about this assassination. When we get to the hospital the President is in a coma and Mike Banning wakes up with more than just a headache. His DNA is all over the van that launched the drones, and there's a bank account with Russian millions in it, too. He's being set up! Who will clear Mike Banning's name? Mike Banning will,"
201,SJZ_Doc1_ItChapterTwo,SJZ_Doc1_ItChapterTwo,SJZ,Horror,Positive,It Chapter Two,"Back in 2017, IT shocked horror audiences by being, well, pretty bloody great. The kids were cute rather than annoying, Bill Skarsgard put a terrifying new spin on a character already made iconic by the legendary Tim Curry, and it somehow managed to be scary, funny, and sweet in equal measure. The flick also scared up over $700 million at the box office so a sequel was inevitable. In reality, however, director Andy Muschietti (who infamously took over from Cary Fukunaga, which was enough to put certain fans off the project entirely) always planned to split Stephen King's seminal doorstop novel into two parts. And that's what's immediately obvious about It Chapter Two; it feels simultaneously like a smooth transition back into Derry and a worthy closing chapter for this story. This isn't a sequel in the traditional sense, rather it's a part two worthy of actually being called that in the first place - this is the second half of the story, and it's essential. We start off back in Derry, where a gay couple is viciously bullied by the toothless locals until one of them falls victim to our old buddy Pennywise. The 27 years since the last movie have not been kind; his suit is tattered and torn, there are new wrinkles forming on his endless forehead, and he has less time to hang around in sewers waiting for kids to stroll past. This ruthless reintroduction to both the harshness of Derry and the horrifying, untold reach of Pennywise's powers expertly establishes Chapter Two's tone. Although the super-cute kids will pop up now and again (the digital de-aging of the puberty-ridden actors didn't bother me as much as others, though it did make their skin creepily Insta-smooth), somehow even cuter than before - it's still not okay to fancy them, just to be clear - this is a much more adult It. The Losers' Club, now scattered around the country far from the horrors of small-town Maine, is all grown up, seemingly successful, and completely miserable - so, typical adult life then. Mike, now played by a soulful and empathetic Isaiah Mustafa, was the only one who stuck around and, as a result, he cops on that Pennywise is back and rallies the others via a series of phone calls that vary between hilarious (Bill Hader, playing a grownup Richie, vomits upon realizing who's ringing him) and downright sad (Jessica Chastain, as adult Beverly, is now being abused by her husband, instead of her father). Our hero Bill (James McAvoy, working his way around the American vowels better than he did ye olde Englishe in this year's execrable X-Men: Dark Phoenix) is the requisite King transplant, who turns up to a movie set and sheepishly tells a clueless production assistant ""I'm...the writer"" before being schooled by a cameoing Peter Bogdanovich for his terrible, bleak endings. Chapter Two shows its weaknesses most in this initial setup, where certain elements read clunkier than perhaps intended, such as Bill reacting"
202,SJZ_Doc2_ItChapterTwo,SJZ_Doc2_ItChapterTwo,SJZ,Horror,Positive,It Chapter Two,"Twenty-seven years after their first encounter with the terrifying Pennywise, the Losers Club have grown up and moved away, until a devastating phone call brings them back. Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) is back. This time he's really, really angry. He has had time to stew on things as IT CHAPTER 2 picks up 27 years after the first film. While most of the kids from the Loser's Club have moved out of Derry, Maine, Mike (Isaiah Mustafa/Chosen Jacobs) has remained. Haunted by the events of the past, he keeps ever vigilant for IT's possible return. When mysterious disappearances begin occurring once again, Mike reaches out to his childhood friends to remind them of their promise to return to kill IT once and for all. I am happy to report that IT Chapter 2 is a worthy sequel to the first film, and in some ways even better. Bigger risks are taken, the violence is more unhinged and effective, scenes get more abstract and dreamlike, and it carries a surprising emotional weight. The film deftly jumps from present to past and back again thanks to a nimble script by Gary Dauberman and clear direction from Andy Muschietti. This necessitates employing the younger performers from the first film along with a new ensemble of expertly cast adult actors. The effect is consistency in character that adds a unique gravitas to the collective performances. We are first reintroduced to all of the Losers as they get the fateful call that pulls them back to their painful childhoods in Derry and the film begins. All but one of the Losers immediately hop onto planes and return home with the exception of Stanley (Andy Bean/Wyatt Oleff). Once back, the Losers meet for dinner at the Jade of the Orient. Each of the losers arrives and sizes one another up in their own way. Beverly (Jessica Chastain/Sophia Lillis), Bill (James McAvoy/Jaeden Martell) Richie (Bill Hader/Finn Wolfhard), Eddie (James Ransone /Jack Dylan Grazer), and Ben (Jay Ryan/Jeremy Ray Taylor) sit at a round table, reconnecting until a lingering feeling of dread takes hold again. As they all slowly recall the evil they faced 27 years before, Mike attempts to convince them that it is their obligation to stay, confront the evil, and defeat it for good. The initial response is to run, screaming into the night and never look back. After a bit of convincing, they all realize that the only way to fight fear is to confront it. Dauberman's script goes to great pains to include the rich mythos of IT as an ancient, cosmic creature that has tormented the area for hundreds of years without sacrificing narrative momentum. The film even goes so far as to touch on the local Native Americans tactics in facing off with the creature and how that could help the Losers. Saddled with their marching orders, each adult Loser heads off to seek a ""token"" to be used in a ritual that will destroy IT for good. As this plays out,"
203,SJZ_Doc3_ItChapterTwo,SJZ_Doc3_ItChapterTwo,SJZ,Horror,Positive,It Chapter Two,"It Chapter Two is beautifully cathartic and emotionally rewarding. Now, usually that's not a sentence I would write to associate with a horror film, but it's surprisingly accurate in summing up the adventure that director Andy Muschietti takes us on. Whether its Ari Aster's Hereditary or Jordan Peele's Get Out and Us, there's no denying there has been a notable shift within the horror genre, focussing more on the emotional substance and its social and psychological effects than the traditional jump scare motifs. To a certain extent, Muschietti's take on the Stephen King classic (with all of its richness and minus that controversial sex scene) has done well to align itself in that same company. Given how traumatic Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) can be with his deceptive smiles and evil manifestations, this is a therapeutic journey to conquer fears and defeat the clown. And trust me, as someone who hates that clown ever since Tim Curry donned the suit and make-up in the TV miniseries, its thematic exploration felt necessary. And that's where we find ourselves, 27 years later with the Losers Club reforming to keep their 'blood oath' promise they made as kids. The entire film is built like an epic blockbuster event that chucks in the kitchen sink equivalence of twists and turns. But like a lot of Stephen King adaptations, its subject matter can be 'out there', but beyond the surface layer of scares which It adopts, elevating from the creepy to the horrifyingly graphic (and the occasional Meta references thrown in as a tribute), its focussed exploration is that childhood loss of innocence. The coming of age vibes is strong as the plot transcends into adulthood with all of its negotiated difficulties and life struggles. But it's genuinely surprising how poignant and reflective It Chapter Two is. Working best as a back-to-back experience (which I recommend), that wave of unexpected emotion lifts the film. Drawing active parallels with Netflix's The Haunting of Hill House with its visual transitions, its switch between the grown-up adults and their young counterparts is instantaneous. It leaves a celebrated nostalgia on the journey they've faced and their growing companionship as friends which you want to revisit. But, you adore the set-up with their older selves, knowing they have to confront and reconcile with the generational trauma of their past. It's an emotional beat often taken for granted, but as much it takes its time to establish those points, you relish their reconnecting journey, proving once again that they are the heart and soul of this film. Rightfully, the film deserves high praise with its casting. Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Bill Hader, Isaiah Mustafa, Jay Ryan, Andy Bean and James Ransone comfortably match their young counterparts with ease, diminishing any hints of star power, but allows room for depth in their spot-on performances. McAvoy mimics Bill's panic stutter that gets worse as the film escalates. Chastain brings the confidence that Sophia Lillis had in the first film, but is always within touching distance"
204,SJZ_Doc4_ItChapterTwo,SJZ_Doc4_ItChapterTwo,SJZ,Horror,Positive,It Chapter Two,"Guess who's back, back again...IT Chapter One was both a box office and critical hit, quickly becoming the highest-grossing horror film of all time. Andy Muschietti's adaptation of Stephen King's beloved novel proved a winning combination of 80's nostalgia and scares (with heart), leading to the birth of a modern horror blockbuster, winning over this absolute wimp in the process! Two years later and Muschietti is back with a brand new, star studded cast in this ambitious and highly anticipated sequel, but does the second outing successfully recapture the magic of the original, whilst simultaneously wrapping the terrifying tale up? Twenty-seven years after the horrific events that occurred in the town of Derry and children begin to mysteriously disappear again, in often gruesome circumstances. Mike (Isaiah Mustafa), the only member of The Losers Club to stay in the town, instantly recognises the spate of juvenile murders, signifying his worst nightmare - the inevitable return of Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard). Armed with the knowledge of how to defeat the clown for good, he reunites the rest of the now grown-up Losers, who must overcome their greatest fears and band together to defeat the evil that reigns over the town. IT Chapter Two is a bigger, bolder and more chilling outing that delves much deeper into the horror aspects of the source material. The film features plenty of nightmare fuelled visions that will definitely stick with you long after the film ends, believe me! The horror sequences were truly gripping, successfully heightening each of your senses - I was genuinely on the edge of my seat for a lot of the third act, which showcased some truly brutal visuals. There were also a number of weird and wonderful Pennywise manifestation which wildly ranged in size and creepiness; some were truly unnerving whereas others (mainly a naked Mrs. Kersh) actually made me giggle, maybe out of nervousness! Along with the scares, Muschietti continues to flesh out King's key theme of facing your fear to overcome personal demons. ""It kills monster if you believe it does"" Beverly encouragingly tells Eddie in one touching scene, highlighting the fact that the Losers once again need each other to face Pennywise. There's also a defining sweet melancholy to this film, highlighting the loss of childhood innocence through cleverly interwoven flashbacks in important moments of the narrative. Tonally though, it's a bit of a strange combination of horror and mythology with comedy and heart, with this mismatch also reflecting in the pacing of the film. Yes Chapter Two clocks in at an impressive 2 hours and 50 minutes, and although it doesn't necessarily feel like too long a film, there was definitely a slow build up to the main action. Those that loved the brilliant chemistry of the original kids - fear not, the casting of the older Losers Club is absolutely perfect, scarily so at times! James Ransone wonderfully captures the neurotic mannerisms of Jack Dylan Grazer's Eddie, once again replicating that endearing banter with Bill Hader's Richie."
205,SJZ_Doc5_ItChapterTwo,SJZ_Doc5_ItChapterTwo,SJZ,Horror,Positive,It Chapter Two,"Calling the monster ""It"" suggests some BigBad that should not be named in polite company--molestation, suicide and depression, abandonment, abuse (domestic or otherwise)--and Andy Muschietti's It: Chapter Two (hereafter It 2) covers each of those bases, literally, along the way of what turns out to be a painfully sensitive metaphor for how the things that happen to us in childhood dig their talons into how we function as adults. Not unlike the pointedly named It Follows, It 2 is a horror film about our personal and collective loss of innocence and the many ways we unsuccessfully suppress our trauma: ""It"" always escapes the containers we put it into--an idea illustrated explicitly at one point in the film as a thing too big for the rituals we use to tame it magnifies in the Jungian sense and explodes in the Freudian, laying waste to our carefully-cultivated gardens. It's possible to outgrow a fear of clowns--a lot less likely that we'll ever outgrow the litany of disasters that fed the fear of clowns in the first place. My mom is dying. Dealing with it has unearthed all of these memories I'd hidden away, of our relationship and of my childhood. I'm not armed. Neither are the ""losers"" of It 2. Fans of the book or the first film will remember the Losers as a group of seven misfit kids who band together to fight an evil in their hometown of Derry, Maine, an ""It"" that sometimes manifests as a clown calling itself ""Pennywise"" but just as often manifests as the kids' worst fears. It harvests its repast, then sleeps for a couple of decades: the world's worst cicada. At the end of the original, the children make a blood pact to return to Derry should It ever resurface. It 2 is It resurfacing. Mike (Chosen Jacobs as a child, Isaiah Mustafa as an adult), the only one of the friends to have stayed behind in Derry, is tasked with calling each person asking them to honour their obligation. When they answer, it's the first they've thought of that fateful summer since moving away. They've covered it over in what Eliot would call a winter of ""forgetful snow""--but they all come back, save one, Stan (Wyatt Olef/Andy Bean), who kills himself in his bathtub rather than face the thing that ruined him in the past. A lot of us reach that same decision. For some of us, it wouldn't take as much to push us there. The Losers' reunion at a Chinese restaurant is marked by bonhomie and then the slow return of their memories and mannerisms. Bill (Jaeden Martell/James McAvoy) starts to stutter again; fat kid Ben, now the picture of health (Jeremy Ray Taylor/Jay Ryan), eats too much; sick kid Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer/James Ransome) finds he needs to get an inhaler at the pharmacy; Richie (Finn Wolfhard/Bill Hader) cuts up; Bev (Sophia Lillis/Jessica Chastain) gets tough. Only Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) remains unchanged. Depression is like that. It never changes either."
206,SJZ_Doc6_ItChapterTwo,SJZ_Doc6_ItChapterTwo,SJZ,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two,"The first instalment of ""It,"" Stephen King's scary clown epic, was about overcoming fears. Specifically, the shape-shifting Pennywise the Dancing Clown a.k.a. It (Bill Skarsgard), the manifestation of all the character's fears. The new film, inventively titled ""It: Chapter Two,"" is about resilience, about sticking your neck out for your friends. The new one is set in 2016, 27 years after the preteen Loser's Club battled Pennywise in his sewer lair and kept the town of Derry, Maine safe from the child gobbling monster. Now, the childhood friends have gone their separate ways. Loser's leader Bill (James McAvoy) is now a successful mystery novelist. Sexual abuse survivor Beverly (Jessica Chastain) went on to become a fashion designer, while Ben (Jay Ryan), the overweight, bullied kid is now an architect living in Nebraska and loud-mouth Richie (Bill Hader) is a comedian in Los Angeles. Other members fled town as well. Hypochondriac Eddie (James Ransone) is a risk analyst and Stanley (Andy Bean) is now an Atlanta-based accountant. Only Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) stayed in Derry. Traumatized by the events of his youth he battles a substance abuse problem but stays on top of Pennywise's existence by sleeping next to a police scanner. ""Something happens when you leave this town,"" says Mike. ""The farther away, the hazier it all gets. But me, I never left. I remember all of it."" When trouble in the form of a clown comes back to town Mike summons the others Losers to come back home to conquer their fears, bond together and do battle with their old foe. ""Did you miss me?"" taunts Pennywise. ""No one wants to play with me anymore."" At almost three hours ""It: Chapter Two"" is an overindulgent mish mash, part horror, a splash of comedy and heaping helping of pop psychology. Oh, and a clown. To say the movie takes its time is an understatement along the lines of suggesting Pennnywise floss more often. It almost feels like you're binging several episodes of a serialized version of the story without the benefit of being able to switch channels when the going gets repetitive. And it gets repetitive. We are endlessly reminded of the character's childhood traumas, told of Pennywise's evil and if someone said to me, ""We've got to stick together,"" as many times Bill says it here, I would make a run for it and never look back. The movie says it best when Ritchie exasperatedly says, ""We're caught up, OK!"" over an hour in, and yet the exposition and repetition continues. There are several striking nightmarish images and Hader provides some much-needed comic relief but it feels as though director Andy Muschietti and screenwriter Gary Dauberman regarded King's novel as some sort of sacred text and were unable to stray from the written word. One of the enjoyable things about King's novels is his world-building, his attention to detail and skill for weaving mythology into real(ish) world situations. The best adaptations of his work carefully parse these elements to boil"
207,SJZ_Doc7_ItChapterTwo,SJZ_Doc7_ItChapterTwo,SJZ,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two,"In my review of ""It"" in 2017, I clearly stated that I liked the setting in which the events were taking place both in terms of location and time. I also explained why I liked the characters, the plot and the message of the film so much. However, I recorded my reservations on the sequence of events and the classification of the film inside the world of horror. For It Chapter 2 I'm afraid I'm gonna have to move everything to the reservations box, maybe with the slight exception of horror and the unexpected utilisation of comedy. 27 years after the events of It chapter 1, the monster awakens. Pennywise the clown reappears and gets detected by Mike; The only member of the losers club who actually remained at Derry, and with the sole purpose of studying how to terminate Pennywise and alarm the others as soon as he appears. Mike contacts the rest of the gang and they do come back to honor their oath, but this time Pennywise is much stronger and more prepared for the challenge of the losers. Chapter 2 can only be described as too messy until it gets too organized and then goes back to the worst mess I can imagine. We start with an event and with characters that we never see again throughout the entire film. Then we spend a lot of time with a struggle of a decision, for which everybody, including the characters, knew the conclusion, and then finally the horror begins. Oh yeah, we only get to see the real horror in the second half. That's how long it took the film to tell us what we already knew. Not just from the trailer, but from the moment we heard there will be a second part for the film. What follows had every potential to be unexpected and shocking, but again the film takes a very wrong decision by presenting it in the most organized way possible. It's the same scenario being repeated over and over again which rendered it totally predictable yet, to my surprise, it remains the best sequence of the entire film. This sequence took us all the way to the ending, which proved that everything that came before it was actually pointless, and we start establishing rules that were never presented before to reach a conclusion that ironically went in total opposition to the actual message of the two parts. Events of Chapter 2 take place in 2016 and like we all know it takes us back to Derry. Only this time the location has no personality and neither do the year we're in. We're in 2016 and we see no real use of technology in any way. In the original novel by Stephen King chapter 2 starts in 1984, and the absence of advanced technology in its events make sense, but our film's decision to start the events in 1989 turned out to be useful for chapter 1 and totally pointless for chapter 2."
208,SJZ_Doc8_ItChapterTwo,SJZ_Doc8_ItChapterTwo,SJZ,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two,"There's a recurring joke in It Chapter Two surrounding the grown-up Bill (played by James McAvoy - Jaeden Martell plays him as a teen). After leaving Derry, he went on to become an author, eventually adapting his books into films. However, he's constantly teased about not knowing how to end his stories. Well, this movie, which completes the story arc started in 2017's It, has a similar problem.Andy Muschietti returns to direct the film, which takes place 27 years after the original. As we see in the first 45 minutes, each member of the self-proclaimed ""Losers Club"" have gone on to achieve relatively normal lives despite the trauma they experienced in their youth. As Mike (Isaiah Mustafa as an adult and Chosen Jacobs as a teen), who never left the town of Derry, Maine, tells them, the further you get from the town the more the memories fade away. But he remembers what happened to them - and it's happening again. The first part of the movie is dedicated to Mike getting the gang back together, which includes Bill, his love interest Beverly (Jessica Chastain and Sophia Lillis), fouled-mouth jokester Richie (Bill Hader and Finn Wolfhard), former fat kid (and now hot) Ben (Jay Ryan and Jeremy Ray Taylor), hypochondriac Eddie (James Ransone and Jack Dylan Grazer), and Andy Bean and Wyatt Oleff as Stanley. While it's all fun and games at first, Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) quickly starts up his old tricks to torment the gang as they try to figure out how to defeat him. Old memories are rehashed and wounds are reopened as each of the ""Losers"" face their pasts. Each of them gets their moment. However, the movie doesn't really explain why each of them needs one. Yes, they all have chips on their shoulder, but each character vignette feels more like a way of letting the starry cast each have their turn in the spotlight. It feels more like filler than an actual plot - which explains the unnecessarily bloated 169-minute runtime.Rather than adding onto and complementing the first movie, Chapter Two feels bogged down by it. Muschietti and screenwriter Gary Dauberman try to make the movie funnier, scarier, more intense, and more emotional. As a result, it's none of those things. I liked the first movie quite a bit. Though it isn't perfect, the plot is more focused and intentional, which makes each scene (and scare) more effective.Chapter Two returns to the playbook that made many of the set pieces in the first work and doubles down on each of those elements, which seems instinctive, but instead, it just means each scene is predictable. That coupled with the overreliance on CGI makes the movie completely devoid of horror. Because the middle section drags so much, the plot is stuffed into the first and last 45 minutes. However, there is so much plot - and so much exposition - that we never get a chance to reform the emotional bond with the characters that makes the"
209,SJZ_Doc9_ItChapterTwo,SJZ_Doc9_ItChapterTwo,SJZ,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two,"It is arguably one of the greatest horror movies of all-time and a fantastic adaptation of Stephen King's lengthy novel (a rarity in Hollywood). Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the bloated sequel which tries too hard to capture the magic of that first instalment while too often neglecting the adult version of the Losers' Club. That 80s charm is gone this time around, and what we're left with is a movie that feels far too bland to make the same sort of impact as the first. Nearly three hours in length, It: Chapter 2 doesn't fly by the same way Avengers: Endgame did earlier this year, and there's so much here that could and should have been cut, it's hard to figure out why the movie is that long anyway. Far too much time is devoted to the young Losers' Club thanks to a rehash of similar but slightly different sequences of them being terrorised by Pennywise during their childhood which we conveniently didn't see in the first movie and that they're only now just remembering. It's almost as if Warner Bros. didn't have any faith in the adult cast being able to capture the magic from the first chapter so the kids (most of whom look pretty bizarre thanks to the special effects used to de-age them) are given way too much screentime at the expense of the present day storyline. Major plot points (such as the return of Henry Bowers) are glossed over relatively quickly and have little impact, while way too much time is spent on a confusing mythology and silly MacGuffin rather than the genuine scares and inventive ideas which peppered It. Too much of the horror here feels like a rehash of what we've seen before, and it's simply not that scary as a result. There are some genuinely great sequences and jump scares here and there, but Pennywise pulls out too many of the same tricks and just doesn't seem to be anywhere near as threatening; he never comes across as demented or twisted as the last time we saw him, and Muschietti really needed to pull out the stops here in order to top his 2017 appearance. It's the performances which save the day here, though, and Bill Hader absolutely steals the show as the adult Richie. Despite the humour often feeling very out of place (and making Pennywise feel even less threatening that he already does), it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role and this performance promises to put the actor back on the map in a big way. James McAvoy (Bill) is also excellent, while Jessica Chastain (Beverly) is fine, but probably not as great as the fans who spent the past few years fan casting her in the role hoped. Between this and Dark Phoenix, 2019 really hasn't been her year. As for Bill Skarsgard, his Pennywise performance is as iconic as ever and it's just a shame he's mostly forced to repeat what's come before"
210,SJZ_Doc10_ItChapterTwo,SJZ_Doc10_ItChapterTwo,SJZ,Horror,Negative,It Chapter Two,"Sorry to pop your balloon, but ""It Chapter Two"" is a mess. The second chapter in the clown saga feels as long as Stephen Kings' 1,138 page novel (it's nearly 3 hours!), and twice as bleak. It's astounding that Andres Muschietti could have made such a downer from such a long beloved source of delight. Instead of a fantasy about the process of maturing, the new one fantasizes about box office numbers. The story is the same-the kids grow up to face Pennywise again, only to come face to face with their own self doubts; defeat your inner fears and you defeat IT. But what it's really about is throwing a bunch of effects at the screen to sell tickets. Gone are the days when the characters were most important. Instead of nature vs nurture, ""It's"" become nature vs torture. Still, this is sure to make a killing at the box office. Fans who are curious to see what's in store for the Losers Club will show out in droves. Expecting a certain brand of scares, millions went in to the first one hungry and left happy (like I-Hop's slogan). Now, we're 27 years into the future and the youngsters are all grown up. Everyone's moved out of the little town of Derry, but they haven't moved on. James McCavoy, an arguably more impressive shapeshifter than Pennywise, plays the Loser Clubs' leader, Bill. He's a big shot screenwriter who is continually told his endings suck-a playful dig at the criticism of King's novel. There's also Jessica Chastain's Beverly, the showroom wife of an abusive husband. Jay Ryan's Ben, the fat kid turned showstopper. James Ransone's Eddie, a risk analyst. Chosen Jacob's Mike, the chronicler of past events. And last but not least, a scene stealing Bill Hader as Richie; a comedian who still makes ""your mom"" jokes after all these years. All of these actors masterfully capture the mannerisms of the child actors before them. But, like the rest of the film, they don't bring anything new to the table. Walking into ""It Chapter Two"" is like walking into a cliche hall of mirrors. Everywhere you look is something you have seen before, and probably done better. That goes for the opening scene in which Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) bites into a mans' chest as if it were a slice of watermelon. Turning to the camera, he gives us a Heath Ledger smile, his lips drooling like a panting puppy, as a bouquet of balloons take to the sky. This means two things: 1) the gangs getting back together!; 2) Ronald McDonald on crack must be stopped! To say the gang gets back together implies more integrity to the writing than is actually at hand. With a killer clown on the loose, you would think that the Losers Club wouldn't waste time. If only. Instead, the preposterously prolonged run time gives us two hours to waste on watching the gang split up, and explore what really scares them. That means opening"
211,AKR_Doc1_Sinister,AKR_Doc1_Sinister,AKR,Horror,Positive,Sinister,"Someone finally figured out a way to make the concept of ""found footage"" interesting, and it's by incorporating it into the film's overall scope rather than employing it as the governing factor. Sinister is an intense horror film that starts out masquerading as something more mundane. It's hair-raising and gripping, although some of its narrative turns require a significant level of ""suspension of disbelief."" In true horror movie tradition, characters do things that are head-scratchingly dumb. Once you accept those logic-defying moments, the movie works with diabolical effectiveness. And, even though the ending is inescapable (and therefore predictable), that does little to diminish its effectiveness. Sinister opens with a disturbing scene: a Super-8 ""home movie"" that shows the hanging deaths of four people. As the narrative progresses, we learn that this is one of several amateur snuff films in existence. There's one of a family burning to death in a car, one of a multiple drowning, one where victims have their throats slit, and a particularly nasty one in which the murder weapon is a lawn mower. During the course of Sinister's running, we see all (or almost all) of these Super 8 movies; the rest of the film is presented using traditional, 3rd-person cinematography (non-shaky cam variety). One element that makes the ""found footage"" approach work uncommonly well in Sinister is that it doesn't hijack the style. There's no lingering question about why someone is always filming. Ethan Hawke, who has been spending time recently in independent productions, plays Ellison Oswalt, a true crime author in desperate need of a new bestseller. Along with his supportive wife, Tracy (Juliet Rylance), and his two children, Trevor (Michael Hall D'Addario) and Ashley (Clare Foley), he moves into the house where the hanging victims lived and begins researching the circumstances of their deaths. In the attic, he finds a box of Super-8 movies that seem innocuous until Ellison watches them. For about the first 30 minutes, Sinister unfolds more like a mystery/thriller than a horror excusrion as Ellison's investigation points toward the possible involvement of a serial killer. Then unexplained things begin to happen: loud noises in the attic, a film projector starting on its own, and a demonic face moving in a supposedly ""still"" photograph on a computer screen. Sinister features its share of effective ""boo!"" moments. The makeup for the mysterious figure is well-done. It's genuinely unsettling and doesn't feel like a re-harsh of any of the horror movie icons. Also, because it's shown only fleetingly, it never loses its power to disturb as a result of overexposure. Director Scott Derrickson (whose resume includes the first-person horror film The Exorcism of Emily Rose as well as the big-budget remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still) develops an atmosphere that emphasizes isolation and claustrophobia. Aside from a friendly local deputy (James Ransone), Ellison has no one beyond his immediate family to turn to for support. There's no generic best friend or brother. The suspense builds in tandem with a burgeoning"

The movie opens with four people standing with nooses around their necks and hoods over their heads. From above the frame, a power saw cuts off a tree limb. As it falls, its weight hangs the victims. Soon after Ellison Oswalt and wife Tracy (Ethan Hawke and Juliet Rylance) move into a spacious suburban house, we can see through the kitchen window that the hanging tree, with a distinctive split branch, is in the backyard. What kind of a psycho would move his family into this house? Even the unfriendly sheriff tells him it's in ""very poor taste."" But the house was priced to sell. Almost immediately Ellison discovers it was no bargain. In the attic, he finds a box labeled ""Home Movies,"" containing reels of Super-8 film and a projector to exhibit them. ""Sinister"" is an undeniably scary movie, with performances adding enough human interest to give depth to the basic building blocks of horror. Ethan Hawke plays an introverted, driven man who wrote a best-selling, true-crime book some years ago and is convinced a book about those ghastly hangings will be another success especially since one member of the doomed family is still missing. His wife shares the misgivings of her children about being uprooted from their former home and being moved to an isolated house in the woods. Her distress grows as Ellison locks himself in his office, and grows distant and distracted. Their children, Trevor and Ashley (Michael Hall D'Addario and Clare Foley), begin to have night terrors and episodes of sleepwalking. Although Tracy remains ignorant of the house's true history, the kids discover it soon enough through playground tauntings. Ashley, who has been given one wall of her room to paint on, begins to summon disturbing images. The film, directed by Scott Derrickson (""The Exorcism of Emily Rose""), focuses on Ellison, who spends much time scrutinizing the 8mm movies, which disturbingly show the murders of other families. He transfers them to his laptop, and his stop-action analysis uncovers almost hidden details. Some shots cause him to recoil in terror. He begins to hit the bottle. His wife grows hostile. Almost all of the action occurs at night. Wouldn't you know for part of the time the power is off in their neighborhood? (The outage doesn't seem to affect the porch lights.) Even when the power seems to be working, Ellison for no reason prefers to creep around the house and climb into the attic carrying a small flashlight, which serves only to make him a target to anything that might be waiting in the dark. I was strongly reminded of Ellen Burstyn creeping into her attic in ""The Exorcist,"" holding only a candle. All"
213,AKR_Doc3_Sinister,AKR_Doc3_Sinister,AKR,Horror,Positive,Sinister,"Ethan Hawke's Ellison Oswald may have the coolest name of a film character this year, but he's having a streak of professional bad luck. His first true crime book, 'Kentucky Blood,' was a best seller than accomplished what the police couldn't do in tracking down a murderer at large. That was years ago, however, and his follow up books haven't just been duds, they've led to wrongful actions that have put the public at risk. There's little love for him among police captains, particularly of the small town where he's just schlepped his family. If you've ever seen a horror movie, you should know what happens next. Don't ever move to a new house. That's one of the lessons of the goofy, yet effective, supernatural horror flick 'Sinister.' Hawke's Oswald on the trail of another unsolved mystery, a family that was drugged and hung from a tree, all except the little girl who was never found again. It's his one last chance before he has to resort to t-t-t-teaching, plus his wife swears if he goes nuts with the all nighters and paranoia and drinking she's picking up the kids and moving to her sister's. So the research begins. He's got files, he's got a cork board with yarn and...what's this? In the attic is a box with film reels and a projector. He's soon watching grainy 8mm footage of the family meeting their doom, as well as other families in different locations from different decades suffering a similar fate. They must be connected, but how? Closer inspection of the film (with the lights down low and the music anticipatory) shows a smudged image that, if you look at it just right just when you can't take the tension anymore will BOOM! be a really scary face that'll make your date grab your forearm like this was Thriller. Hawke's pursuit of the truth drives him to madness as it tears his family apart (yeah, he never bothered to tell his wife that they moved into the murder house) and soon this professional skeptic is worried he's brought an ancient Sumerian curse to his family. 'Sinister' has no shortage of dumb moments. Why oh why can't anyone just turn on the freakin' lights when they hear something to bump in the night? And why wouldn't this so-called investigator watch ALL of the spooky film strips immediately, and not space them out in a way that propels the screenplay? The reason, of course, is because that's what only half-intelligent horror movies do. But for simple surface entertainment 'Sinister' is effective. Did you get creeped out at 'Insidious?' Did you yelp at the jump scares, then laugh when your friends razzed you? Then this is one you need to check out. Props to the director, Scott Derrickson, working with what I imagine was a very low budget. Despite hardly ever leaving a handful of rooms, the movie doesn't feel cramped. Ethan Hawke is also quite effective in a very standard role. His natural"
214,AKR_Doc4_Sinister,AKR_Doc4_Sinister,AKR,Horror,Positive,Sinister,"A horror movie can be a fun, campy scare. It can be a deeply disturbing scare. But it's when you find that happy medium between the two that you end up with something that's absolutely horrifying in the best way possible. Something you're eager to think about well after the credits roll because it's fun that it gives you the creeps. Ellison (Ethan Hawke) is a true crime novelist who hit it big with a book called Kentucky Bloody, earning him a legion of fans and making him a household name. Trouble is, he hasn't had a hit since. Desperate to keep himself from being a one hit wonder, Ellison drags his wife (Juliet Rylance) and two kids around the country trying to find a grizzly crime to make the focus of his next book. Somewhat fed up after Ellison's last failed attempt his wife agrees to move to a neighborhood in Pennsylvania where a family was brutally murdered, having been hung from a tree in their own backyard. Little does she know, Ellison didn't just opt to move to a home in the area or even down the block; Ellison bought the house where the murders took place. Shortly after moving in, Ellison comes across a box in the attic containing five reels of film as well as a projector. To his horror and delight, he discovers that the films aren't just memories left behind by a previous owner, rather the killer's documentation of not only the infamous hangings, but four other brutal family murders, too. Ellison is sure he's hit the jackpot and that this will in fact lead to his next big book, and he's willing to do whatever it takes to ensure that that happens, even if it means putting himself and his family at risk. It's easy to give someone the creeps or make their heart skip a beat with a jump scare, but Sinister takes it one step further, making the situation feel horrifyingly real. The five family murders are downright disturbing in and of themselves, but then the found footage technique puts you in the killer's shoes, making them feel incredibly authentic and, in turn, especially terrifying. The film actually opens with the footage of the hanging, which plays out at a wonderful yet painstakingly slow pace, engraining the awful imagery in your mind and also giving you a sense of what you should be prepared for. And if that's not enough, then we get this concept of Bagul. There are a ton of creepy ghost and demon stories out there, but Bagul is one that'll undoubtedly haunt you well after Sinster's credits roll. The legend itself is quite off-putting and then the way he's slowly revealed on screen makes him feel ever-present and even more threatening. There are a handful of suggestive plot points that spoil what should have made for a big twist, but the mechanics of the plot are still impressive, writer-director Scott Derrickson weaving the reality and the mythology"
215,AKR_Doc5_Sinister,AKR_Doc5_Sinister,AKR,Horror,Positive,Sinister,"Law enforcement doesn't like Ellison Oswald (Hawke), who has made a career of exposing their mistakes on high-profile cases. But it's been more than a decade since he's had a hit book, and as the writer's realization that he may be a one-hit wonder settles in, his methods become more desperate. Sinister opens with an 8mm snuff film depicting a scene most adults would rather never see: A mom, a dad and two kids stand beneath a tree, tied by noose to a branch that snaps up, lifting them all into the air where they thrash to their deaths. With no suspects, the local police got nowhere in their attempt to explain the murders; nor were they able to find the family's third child, Stephanie (Victoria Leigh). Ellison aims to solve the mystery, allowing the film to operate in heavy-exposition mode for much of its running time, goosing the investigation every now and then with hints that he's getting help from whoever made that sinister homemovie. In contrast with previous cases, in which Ellison moved his family into a house down the street from past crimes, this time, he actually bought the victims' home, empty except for a single box in the attic that contains five old film canisters, each more nightmarish than the last. While his supportive wife (Juliet Rylance) and two kids uneasily adjust to their new life, Ellison cracks open the whisky and fires up the projector. As if the deaths captured on film aren't upsetting enough, other clues reveal themselves in his obsessive research details that suggest a supernatural force may be at play. Through it all, one message is clear: Ellison needs to get his family out of that house. In concept, Sinister offers yet another twist on the found-footage device so popular among horror pics these days, but instead of using that setup to throw production value out the window, Derrickson and co-writer C. Robert Cargill (an Ain't It Cool News reporter who pitched the helmer his concept) favor the classical chiller approach. Blending darkly atmospheric widescreen lensing by Chris Norr (who also shot Hawke's The Hottest State) with bump-in-the-night sound design from Dane A. Davis, the crew transforms the Oswald's new house into a claustrophobic, crazy-making space. Except within the gritty homemovies, which implicate both Ellison and the audience in their unflinching voyeurism, the camera hangs close to Hawke's increasingly agonized face, capturing Ellison's deteriorating state of mind with a relish that recalls The Shining. Though the film isn't the type to distract with in-jokes and references, the appearance of an ax in the final reel can't be accidental. Unlike Kubrick's classic, however, Sinister gives its writer-hero an enviably stable wife, one capable of politely reminding her legacy-obsessed husband that his kids should take precedence over his work. As the disturbances intensify, Ellison becomes convinced that some sort of figure can be seen lurking in each of the films, a menacing painted-face personage with white skin and black triangle eyes. He consults a"
216,AKR_Doc6_Sinister,AKR_Doc6_Sinister,AKR,Horror,Negative,Sinister,"More stupid than scary, Sinister can't even figure out who its real demon is. The bony finger of the skeletal script points to a bogeyman with the oh-so-clever nickname Mr. Boogie, who has a yen for mass murder and Super 8 home movies. I'd argue the bogeyman it should be is Mr. Google, whom I'll get to in a moment. Mr. Boogie (or Bagul, if you want to get formal) is the pesky demon terrorizing true-crime novelist Ellison Osborne (Ethan Hawke), who foolishly moved his family into a crime scene. It's the rural Pennsylvania home whose previous four occupants died by hanging on the backyard tree, a ghastly scene presented in the prologue. A fifth family member, a child, went missing and remains so. Ellison doesn't bother to reveal the house's horrific past to his wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance) and their two children Ashley (Clare Foley) and Trevor (Michael Hall D'Addario). He still doesn't open up when he discovers a cache of Super 8 movies in the attic, each of them revealing a family dying from fire, water or other catastrophe. He just keeps watching those movies, while also guzzling Scotch and making furtive attempts to pound out another best-seller to revive his career, which has been on the skids for a decade or more. It's a given that people do dumb things in horror movies, such as failing to switch on the lights when they enter a dark room. Ellison does all these things and more. A certain indulgence is required, but Sinister writer/director Scott Derrickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose) and co-writer C. Robert Cargill expect too much. Dumb becomes lazy way too often. How could Tracy possibly not know that she's living in a house o' horrors, especially since her kids have heard about it at school? Why doesn't Ellison flip when he discovers a scorpion and a poisonous snake in his attic? Why does he need glasses, but takes them off to peer into the darkness? Most important of all, why doesn't Ellison just use Google to research the links between the killings at his house and similar ones across the U.S.? He knows to use computers and the Internet, but he seems determined to do things the hard way such as getting a dopey deputy sheriff (James Ransone) and dull college professor (Vincent D'Onofrio) to search for clues that a few clicks of the keyboard would have yielded. Call it the curse of the digital age. Sinister is a low-budget horror film trying for old-school shocks. But the production can't afford a pre-Internet setting, so instead you have a protagonist haunted by the spectre of evil Mr. Google, who fiendishly teases his victims by clouding minds and hoarding answers. Hawke isn't to blame for Sinister's many failings. With his perpetual guilty eyes and drawn features, he's good at playing a haunted figure. He'd have made a great Hitchcock character. So would Fred Thompson, whose brief appearances as a scolding sheriff provides a rare instance where"
217,AKR_Doc7_Sinister,AKR_Doc7_Sinister,AKR,Horror,Negative,Sinister,"A crime writer's quest for fame leads him into a world of demonic possession and home snuff movies in Sinister, a mixed bag of old-school and contemporary horror tricks that occasionally raises a hair prickle of intrigue. Along with obvious debts to such seventies milestones as The Shining and The Exorcist, Sinister also employs the current vogue for ""found footage"" shocks in such films as the Paranormal series (which shares producer Jason Blum). Though unoriginal, the film by Scott Derrickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose) is effective in a narrow range; it's mechancially relentless in delivering grisly images, like pies on a conveyer belt, straight to the viewer's eyeballs. Ethan Hawke, wearing writerly big glasses, a goatee and a cardigan, plays Ellison Oswalt, a true-crime journalist whose only bestseller, Kentucky Blood, came out a decade ago. He's determined to get another hit book by writing about the unsolved case of a family that was ritually hanged from a tree in their backyard. Unbeknownst to his wife, Tracy (Juliet Rylance), Ellison has moved her, along with their adolescent son and daughter, into the very house where the crimes took place. Though the regal Rylance, a British stage actress, participates in a couple of squabbles about Ellison's domestic shortcomings, her presence barely registers here - less than the ominous corridors of their suburban home, or even Christopher Young's aggressive score. This is a movie that's mostly about Ellison, watching and becoming increasingly implicated in what he sees. While exploring the attic on the first day, Ellison comes across a box with Super 8mm film reels and a projector. The titles on the cans are domestically innocuous (BBQ, Sleepy Time and, oh yes, Hanging Out). That night, while knocking back a bottle of whisky, Ellison watches the movies in his new study and realizes he's seeing atrocities taking place. Consistent with the complicity/guilt mechanism of this kind of film, Ellison can't stop watching. The home movies are obviously important evidence, but after starting to call the police, Ellison decides instead to save the material for his book. While studying the films further, he begins to see a white-faced, long-haired figure, who looks like a member of Kiss, appearing in the background of some of the frames. On the advice of a bumbling deputy sheriff (The Wire's James Ransone), Ellison calls up the local demonology expert, played by Vincent D'Onofrio, who, in a consultation via Skype, tells Ellison this looks like the work of an ancient Babylonian ""eater of children"" who steals their souls by exposing them to certain images. As an explanation of the movie classification system, this is novel (""Children under 12 may be stolen by demons""), but it's a lazy exit strategy for the plot. (The introduction of a Babylonian demon in a horror movie is roughly equivalent to the ""Then I woke up and discovered it was a dream"" ending in elementary-school fiction.) For about half its running time, Sinister maintains some ambiguity about whether the evil is in Ellison's"
218,AKR_Doc8_Sinister,AKR_Doc8_Sinister,AKR,Horror,Negative,Sinister,"Much has been made of the first five minutes of Sinister (* * stars out of four, rated R, out nationwide Friday), and rightfully so. They're some of the best horror scenes of the year. Unfortunately, that's the highlight for this surprisingly by-the-book haunted house story. Despite having an actual actor in Ethan Hawke and a co-screenwriter (Robert Cargill) from Ain't It Cool News, a site known for dismantling pedestrian movies, Sinister abides by the three rules of Hollywood Horror: Never turn on a light, never tell the cops (even if you are one), and investigate bumps in the night by yourself, preferably with a baseball bat or butcher knife. It adds up to a sizable whiff on a softball of a premise: A true-crime writer (Hawke) discovers a cache of 8mm films suggesting serial killings dating back decades. Director Scott Derrickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose) manages some nice chills through the movie's ""found footage,"" the hottest craze in horror since torture porn. Blurry, grainy and revealing little gore, the scenes of past slayings demonstrate how tension done right is a lot more terrifying than graphic violence. But Sinister does little with the footage besides grind it into a bland hybrid of The Ring and Paranormal Activity, though Sinister relies more on ""gotcha"" moments than storytelling. Hawke plays Ellison Oswalt, a true crime novelist desperate to repeat the success of his best seller a decade ago. Sporting an elbow-patched cardigan and thick glasses, Hawke is fine if cliched as an egomaniacal author so starved for fame he moves his unwitting family into the home of a family hanging -- the movie's opening scene. Ellison is barely unpacked before he finds a box of Super 8 spools and a projector. With brandy in hand, he watches reel after reel of the deaths, a series of creepy and effective murders that got fanboys in a lather after the film debuted at the SXSW film festival earlier this year. The buzz is a puzzler, particularly since Sinister's hero makes agonizingly dumb decisions and the movie draws so heavily from The Ring, the 2002 chiller about a demon that possesses anyone who sees it on videotape. Sinister's villain is more tech-savvy and even Mac-compatible (Apple tie-ins are everywhere). Some of the film's biggest jumps come from the demon haunting Ellison through his computer screen. So why is he called Mr. Boogie, one of the film's myriad boilerplate touches? For every genre convention Sinister sidesteps, it follows with a formulaic turn. Ellison finds evidence of serial killings with a satanic edge, but tells just one cop, whom he swears to secrecy. Ghosts rattle, kids scream and the house has a snake and scorpion problem. Yet Ellison doesn't warn his children that reptiles roam the attic. Or even call an exterminator. None of that would propel Sinister to its inexorable finale, a showdown between Ellison and an ancient spirit that not only finds fresh ways to murder clans, but gives his reality clips clever titles"
219,AKR_Doc9_Sinister,AKR_Doc9_Sinister,AKR,Horror,Negative,Sinister,"Scott Derrickson's much-heralded horror film Sinister is unlikely to leave you sleepless. At least it didn't me, and I'm a total wimp. The movie is full of feints, shocks and scenes of particularly perverse violence, but nothing about it is fresh enough to haunt you in the night. It's predictable. Its underlying theme about the corrupting power of images passed like deadly chain letters is effective, but not as much as it was back when the Japanese film Ringu (The Ring) introduced it. That's partly because the theme has been amplified so extremely; instead of a spooky girl climbing out of the television, Derrickson shows us home movies that are essentially snuff films. Lots of them. Filmed images begetting more violence would seem a way to subvert the horror genre, except they're presented almost as pornography. There is no lesson learned here. Not unless you count the one the jerk played by Ethan Hawke gets. He's the ideal emotionally expendable protagonist, true crime writer Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke), a guy with a whiff of Joe McGinniss about him. Ellison moves his whole family, wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance) and young son and daughter into a house where Very Bad things happened a family of four was killed in a ritual act so that he'll have an easier time researching his next book. He's so arrogant and self-centered he doesn't consider how it might affect them, and that's before more Very Bad things start happening. He's not even partly apologetic when Tracy, a week into living there, finds out they're living in a house that was the site of a notorious multiple homicide. Well, it didn't exactly happen in the house. It was in the backyard, Ellison defensively declares to Tracy. Right there in that tree yonder with the broken limb, where Mom, Dad and two kids were hung in a neat little row. (Tracy allowed Ellison to pick a house in this new town, sight unseen. Such passivity hello Zillow.com and her ability to sleep through epic occult-related happenings are among the movie's weaker points. But Rylance looks cute in a tank top, which is what she's there for.) Trouble begins up in the attic on the first evening, but Ellison stays confident he can get to the heart of the mystery, which he believes is manmade rather than supernatural. It's been 10 years since his last #1 bestseller, Kentucky Blood, and he needs this book. This could be my In Cold Blood, he says. His stubborn refusal to drop the case plays into one of our baser instincts, the desire to feel superior to a person who dares to feel superior to us. Which in turn makes it easier to see the person twist in the proverbial wind of horror. Hawke's on-target performance only enhances the fun; he stops short of the full weasel but no one is going to weep over the fate of Ellison Oswalt if things don't end well. As Naomi Watts did with the American remake"
220,AKR_Doc10_Sinister,AKR_Doc10_Sinister,AKR,Horror,Negative,Sinister,"Desperate for another New York Times bestseller after his mega-successful, police-incriminating Kentucky Blood, and in search of morbid inspiration, true-crime novelist Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke, his trademark highfalutin', neurotic superego on full display) moves his wife and two children into a ranch house where a gruesome family hanging recently took place. Suitably clothed in a Bennington College T-shirt and elbow-patched sweater, with glasses dangling around his neck, Ellison, the royalties from his one bit hit waning along with his family's patience, finds it apt to keep the truth of their new, bargain-priced home a secret only alluding to the fact that the murders occurred in the same town. A barrage of past and present exposition floods the film's first act, and amid a conversation regarding the very recent murders that Ellison is researching, Ellison's wife, Tracy (stage actress Juliet Rylance), shouts, I don't want to hear why we're here again from anybody, and it's hard to disagree. After the unpacking of boxes, as well as blatant familial and professional baggage, Ellison wanders up to the attic and discovers a single metal crate containing Super 8 reels and a projector. Locked in his office, Ellison fires up the machine and allows the fascinatingly gruesome films to wash over him, both excited by the secret evidence for his nascent novel and disturbed by the imagery (in the process, downing tumblers of whiskey). These films are worthy of obsession as director Scott Derrickson employs within them the now-typical language of jump cuts and static soundscapes to genuinely chilling effect. But Sinister, which often feeds off clever ways to trail the viewers' eye to a startling moment of sudden dread, is unable to take advantage of its adept use of found footage in relation to the anemic moral dilemma Derrickson tries to derive depth from or from the haunted house-style booby traps Ellison occasionally experiences. Even the family dynamic is boilerplate horror: The wife is capital-L loyal, the son is prone to somnambulistic night terrors, and the daughter is a precocious Picasso. With Ellison's decision to keep the videos from the authorities, despite multiple bumps in the night as a consequence of his film-viewing, Derrickson attempts to capture a flimsy Capote-esque quandary of a writer putting himself and others in danger in order to claim fame (at one point, Ellison even exclaims that the story he's following could be his In Cold Blood). Taking a cue from the Wally Pfister Academy of Gloomy Cinematography, Sinister is a film about shadows: the resonance of past tragedies, the reflection on a may-be-bygone career, even the way Ellison never flips on a light switch when anxiously following the strange noises in his house at night. Ellison's fascination with and thorough usage and manipulation of celluloid to solve a crime recalls Antonioni's Blowup and De Palma's Blow Out, but Derrickson is unable to conjure an aura that isn't as transparent and weightless as a ghost. The film apprehends the significance of indelible imagery, and yet leads to a"

I like to go with the flow - watch what I want, ignore what doesn't interest me, and that's it. But if there is one thing I genuinely miss, it's the period where decently budgeted, high concept creature-features could be made and given wide theatrical releases. And they were mainstream! Every once in a while one may slip through the cracks (Alexandre Aja's Crawl and the 47 Meters Down films being recent examples) but for the most part this type of theatrical experience is dead. David Twohy's Pitch Black just recently celebrated its 22nd birthday this year, and I think it's time to celebrate the unlikely franchise-starter for being a damn good sci-fi/horror film that first introduced the cult favorite anti-hero, Riddick. By the time Pitch Black dropped David Twohy had already been in the game for quite some time. His first Hollywood writing credit is for Critters 2: The Main Course and from there he went on to write the cult classic Warlock and has credits for everything ranging from The Fugitive to G.I. Jane to Waterworld. Pitch Black was his third time in the director's chair after helming Timescape and The Arrival. Working from an initial script given over for him to tinker with, Twohy rewrote the film to amp it up into its own beast. There is a distinctive hard-edge, no-nonsense quality to Pitch Black that makes it very appealing. There is a dose of John Carpenter-esque cynicism to the story and characters here that feel right at home alongside films like Escape from New York and The Thing. A transport vessel cruising the backwaters of the space lanes is struck by a rogue asteroid, causing it to crash on a desolate planet scorching under perpetual daylight. The ship was transporting dozens of individuals in cryosleep - everything from holy men on a pilgrimage to one hell of a dangerous convict by the name of Richard B. Riddick - Vin Diesel's breakout, and in my opinion, best role. In their struggle to figure out a way off the planet, the survivors soon find out that they arrived just in time for the planet's nightfall 22 years in the making-and with the darkness comes the monsters. Their only hope of getting off the planet relies on the killer they all fear. Riddick can see in the dark. Can a monster save them from other monsters? High concept premises like this almost always hinge on the characters, and Twohy manages to craft a handful of them that refreshingly break the mold they initially seem to occupy. Our lead, Fry (Radha Mitchell) is hiding a secret from the rest of the survivors - that she almost jettisoned them into space to save her own ass. The cop transporting Riddick, Johns (Cole Hauser) turns out not to be a cop at all, but a mercenary with a drug addiction"
222,CHL_Doc2_PitchBlack,CHL_Doc2_PitchBlack,CHL,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pitch Black,"When Pitch Black first hit theaters, I immediately dismissed it as another comer to try and take on Ripley's xenomorphs. A bunch of trapped, dirty characters stumbling around in a darkness filled with vaguely defined reptilian/insectoid creatures, running low on ammo and dying one by one? Yeah, it's been done before. But J, that loveable curmudgeon that he is, has so openly espoused his love of Richard B Riddick (his review of Chronicles of Riddick was surprisingly upbeat) that I eventually had to cave and see what my good buddy had seen that was so intriguing. I have to admit, I really back him up on this one. Pitch Black is a pretty damn good creature flick for a few simple reasons. First and foremost, they don't overdo the creatures. 45 minutes into the flick, the audience still hasn't gotten much (if any) idea of what the threat is, or that it even exists. Our clearest view of the monsters usually comes from the point of view of Riddick himself, in his weird ""shine job"" vision. But it doesn't drag or feel deprived, it's just paced really, really well. By the time random characters start getting torn into hors d'oeuvres (here's a hint, three of them don't speak any English... hmmm, do ya think they might be among the first to go?) the audience is still too busy dealing with Reason Two that Pitch Black is any good: Riddick. It was with a tinge of regret that I finally rented my first Vin Diesel movie (I'd successfully gone five years since his breakthrough without watching even one, with the debatable exception of The Iron Giant). But give the man his due, Diesel makes Riddick a damn cool antihero. In the opening shots on board the passenger ship, Riddick's blindfold, bit, and chains make him look almost as alien as the bugs down on the planet. He's intimidating, deadpan funny, and generally badass. The first half of the movie is spent not in fear of the aliens, but in fear of Riddick. He's a palpable, believable threat. Sure, his turn to help the rest of the crew escape starts to feel a bit illogical, but I can ignore this in the face of some fun bughunting. I just liked the fact that we had a character who couldn't be predicted... he'll save a character in one shot, but be ready to leave the deadly planet (and the other survivors) behind him in another. Relying a little too much on his mental instability as a character trait? Maybe, but it was still fun. The flick was good. It's not deep, it's not overly philosophical, but it comes to do a job, and it does it nearly as well as Aliens did so many years before it. With a decent cast of characters (hey, look, it's the chick from Farscape playing, um, the chick from Farscape...) and a sense of style that's good enough to forgive all the little logical silly bits, I"
223,CHL_Doc3_PitchBlack,CHL_Doc3_PitchBlack,CHL,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pitch Black,"It's Vin Diesel week! Suddenly, this largely unknown actor, whose only significant credits were a part in Saving Private Ryan and some voice work in The Iron Giant (as the title character), is a hot commodity with significant roles in two films opening the same day. Diesel fans are strongly advised to see both Boiler Room and Pitch Black, as they show different aspects of the actor's range. In Boiler Room, he's a regular guy working a regular job. In Pitch Black, he goes into full Arnold Schwarzenegger mode, flexing his muscles, grunting, and uttering the occasional one liner. It's not an especially challenging part, but Diesel handles it with aplomb. Pitch Black can be viewed as a slick, stylish version of the kind of outer space creature feature that is typified best by the Alien movies. At its best (which is quite often), Pitch Black is an entertaining effort. On the down side, there are times when various largely anonymous characters wander around in the dark and do incredibly stupid things while being stalked by vicious alien creatures. As they get picked off one-by-one, the only question is who's going to be next. The last time writer/director David Twohy wandered into the science fiction arena, the result was the surprisingly intelligent and involving The Arrival, about an alien infestation on Earth. For most of Pitch Black, Twohy has brought the same level of thoughtfulness to this screenplay. The initial half-hour, which details the crash-landing of a spaceship on a barren desert planet, is particularly good. Once the first alien makes its appearance, things become routine from a storyline perspective, but the level of suspense escalates. To fill in the dead spots between alien attacks, we are treated to a series of recycled interpersonal conflicts. And, for those who are bothered by such things, the film's so-called ""science"" employs a few key violations of the laws of physics. The movie begins with the crash, a violent concussion that leaves most of the crew and passengers dead. Among the handful of survivors are Fry (Radha Mitchell), the pilot; Johns (Cole Hauser), a police officer; Riddick (Diesel), a convicted murderer who is being transported in chains; and Inam, a holy man (Keith David). The planet is an apparently lifeless wasteland - a desertscape where three suns assure that there is no night and possibly no water. Shortly after the rough landing, Riddick escapes, but, while the survivors are looking for him, they too are being hunted - by a species of alien that shuns the daylight but is lethal in the dark. Soon, with the realization that the world is about to be plunged into blackness by an inconvenient total eclipse, everyone must learn to trust Riddick, who can see in the dark, if they are to survive. Meanwhile, it's unclear whether Riddick's primary goal is self-preservation or redemption. The acting is solid, if largely unremarkable. Most of the principals have fallen effortlessly into the stereotyped roles of quirky characters who are"
224,CHL_Doc4_PitchBlack,CHL_Doc4_PitchBlack,CHL,Sci-Fi,Positive,Pitch Black,"Pitch Black is a sci-fi/horror flick about a merchant vessel that unexpectedly crash lands on an uninhabited planet. It's something of a combination of Alien, Hitchcock's The Birds, and the classic Isaac Asimov short story and novel, Nightfall. The Nightfall stuff is what interests me the most. The planet they're trapped on has three suns and at first appears to feature permanent daylight. The survivors slowly discover, as a group of long dead settlers did before them, that night falls once every 22 years -- and of course, tonight's the night. There are huge flying hammerhead shark-bats living underground that emerge as soon as it gets dark and eat any living thing they can find. They can rip people apart in seconds. The survivors are really and truly screwed. I didn't know much about Pitch Black when I first saw it on cable (probably around 2001) and had never heard of Vin Diesel, so I actually didn't know during that first viewing that Riddick was the central character. I do remember thinking early in the movie that they should stop focusing on Fry and Johns and give us more screen time with that fascinating villain with the deep voice, mirror eyes and amazing biceps, and of course, they did. Sometimes I think we should all be able to come to movies this way, with no foreknowledge or preconceptions, because by the end of it, I had a serious soft spot for Diesel. His strong performance and impressive physicality dominate this movie. He managed to pull off terrifying, witty, smart, heroic, amused and even sexy. (Maybe the sexy part was because of the numerous early shots of him chained with his arms extended. And wow.) I also liked the progression of Radha Mitchell's character Carolyn Fry, who becomes the ship's captain right before the crash and immediately starts making the wrong decisions. As the movie progresses, Fry slowly internalizes what it means to be a captain, to have responsibility for the lives of others, and she shows Riddick the meaning of heroism. Mitchell gives a good performance; she and Diesel are the standouts. To highlight the redemption plot, we have Keith David as Imam, a holy man on his way to Mecca, who points out the obvious religious significance of the actions that the characters take. Cole Hauser also does a good job as Johns, and Rhiana Griffith is fun as Jack, a teenage stowaway who begins to idolize and emulate Riddick. The cast also includes Farscape's Claudia Black, whom I wish had gotten more to do. She could have rocked the part of Fry. Oh, well. Along with Diesel's impressive star turn as Riddick, a big part of what makes Pitch Black so good is the visuals. The first half of the movie is dominated by the different shades of light thrown by the three suns: everything, including the characters, are tinted either yellow, blue or orange. As shadows fall and the suns move to eclipse, the way the characters"

The survivors include one crew member, a Muslim pilgrim and his family, an eccentric traveler, a couple of other passengers (i.e. alien food), a cop, and a prisoner named Riddick. All have their own dark secrets and hidden pasts. The survivors soon discover an abandoned geologic research station nearby. All of the scientists are gone, and we quickly find out why. Bizarre, bat-like nocturnal creatures live under the ground in the dark. They seem to be very hungry, too, and the scientists were their last meal. Take a creature from Aliens, mix it with a bat, a panther, and a hammerhead shark and you have these critters. There are also smaller, faster flying versions, too. The survivors realize they must stick together if they will make it off the planet, however most all of them are selfish in their own way. The motto of the group seems to be 'Let's stick together, because when the monsters come I only have to run faster than you to get away!' Can they make it out alive? They must transport some power cells to a small spacecraft at the outpost in order to get off the planet. But (and there's always a 'but') a rare eclipse of the three suns takes place and the planet becomes dark. The creatures then come out in force and the race to get away is on. Only light keeps the creatures at bay, but how long will that last? THE GOOD: THIS IS THE BEST SCIENCE FICTION FILM OF THE NEW MILLENNIUM!!!!!!! (Well, actually the millennium is only one and a half months old, and it technically doesn't start till January 2001, but I wanted to see if I could get quoted like Harry Knowles in Pitch Black ads. :) ) Truthfully, I enjoyed this film. I wanted a good popcorn flick with cool effects and a lot of action, and that's what I got. The plot is not particularly deep, but for what it sets out to do, it does well. The cast was well chosen. Vin Diesel was excellent as the prisoner Riddick. He's tough, he's mean, and he's definitely no good guy, but you begin to like him nevertheless. Diesel played the part very well and I'd definitely like to see him play this character again. I think he'd be great in other action flicks. The rest of the cast did good jobs as well. The special effects weren't ground breaking caliber, but they were still good. The ship crash had some excellent moments and there is one particular scene where the creatures take flight at the beginning of the eclipse that is memorable. A really beautiful shot as clouds of the creatures swarm in the sky with the eclipse as a background. To make the planet a little more otherworldly, colored filters were used to"

On the other hand, my brain, being the juicy piece of meat it is, helps me overcome the fallopian tube challenge by actually allowing me to decipher between genius action/sci-fi/etc. flicks (Blade Runner, Alien) and absolute bullocks (Starship Troopers, Wing Commander). Pitch Black falls squarely in between those two extremes. It had really cool special effects that were put to good use (them flying flesh eaters sure were scary lookin'), it looked good (was captured on film interestingly) and had a good basic story structure to build from. However, it could have been really amazing but for some reason just couldn't come up with the goods. I can picture the pitch meeting for this movie (where the writers go to the production companies and try to sell the script) and I understand why a producer would green light this story. There's this futuristic space vehicle transporting cargo, people and, oh yeah, a psychopath and the bounty hunter assigned to bring him back where he came from. On the way home there's an accident, the ship is forced to crash land and this strange mix of folks have to figure a way off a planet that seems at least manageable at first. Then things turn into a flesh ripping nightmare once they figure out they're basically dinner for the planet's underground dwelling inhabitants. The only thing that will keep them alive is their wits, their creative use of light sources on a totally dark planet and their teamwork even if one of them is a depraved maniac. I'm down with that. It's Tremors meets Cube meets C.H.U.D. meets Silence of the Lambs. Plus it's got Vin Diesel and Cole Hauser in it and they're both smokin' in their own ways, so there's some eye candy to enjoy along with the guts and the screaming and the hey, hey, hey. Only problem is that it seems somewhere between the pitch meeting and the final edit of this film, a whole bunch of annoying crap got thrown in that makes no sense and there were golden opportunities to have some really cool and interesting things happen in the group's attempts at survival that just never worked out. Another disappointment was that, although Vin Diesel LOOKED like a total bad ass and TALKED like a total bad ass and apparently has some past history of ACTING like a total bad ass, if it weren't for the fact that he could see in the dark (how CONVENIENT!) and lift heavy things while at the same time looking sexy in a dangerous kind of way, he wasn't much of a character and didn't really do a whole lot. Then there's the fact that the eclipse that happens every 22 years on this planet, the one that sets off the carnage and the mayhem,"

Remember the creepy atmosphere, the horrifying aliens, the desolate surroundings, and the terrifying conclusions? If Pitch Black can and should be compared to anything, it should be the first two Alien movies, since they use very similar formulas. The Alien movies are tough to beat, but even coming halfway close to those classics would give Pitch Black a worthy recommendation... Pitch Black includes a group of unrecognizable actors (except maybe Vin Diesel, who has been in a few big films), which can be a plus if done right (Screamers is an example of a low budget sci-fi thriller that packs quite a punch). The movie boasts some aggressive direction as well, although at times the coloring seems a little too aggressive. But most of all, the movie deals with a group of stranded humans on a planet that has only one indigenous species - terrible creatures that only come out at night. But since there is no nighttime, they should be all right, except for the fact that the planet is about to go through a full solar eclipse. For a low budgeted movie, Pitch Black looks pretty good. It has some impressive computer graphics and visually impressive scenes, whether referring to the last glimpse of light or the graveyard of skeletons that they find fairly quickly. The director uses some really cool angles and movements, and while some were disturbed by the sheer two-color scheme early on in the movie, I found it quite original. But Pitch Black promises to be scary, suspenseful, and a worthy science fiction film. Does it live up to its promise? No. It's not that Pitch Black doesn't have some scenes that could make you jump (some people were jumping quite frequently - I wasn't), or that it has some exciting moments, but the movie overall never draws me into the atmosphere. First off, it might be because non of the characters are very likeable. Radha Mitchell, the apparent star of the film (competing with Diesel), tries to kill all her passengers to save herself in the first three minutes of the film. Vin Diesel, though the hero of the film, is also an escaped psychopath (but I did like him). There is also a nerdy British guy who likes wine, and a group of Middle East religious folks who seem really out of place in this sci-fi film. And there is this one kid that is really annoying. Second, there isn't anything memorable about the film. The eclipse sets in just as they are prepping to take the power cells to a ship they find, so, of course, the plot of the movie is that they need to get from Point A to Point B without being eaten. Along the way, they do stupid little things to get themselves killed. Furthermore, the movie does not take advantage of the fact that the movie is pitch black. The film hints at the fact several times that there are aliens all around,"
228,CHL_Doc8_PitchBlack,CHL_Doc8_PitchBlack,CHL,Sci-Fi,Negative,Pitch Black,"Pitch Black has a great premise: it's an SF story in which our heroes have good reason to be afraid of the dark. Visually, it's impressive. We have different kinds of darkness, vision and light on this planet, with three different-coloured suns. One comes out, everything's blue. Another comes out, everything's yellow. It's a relief when they get back to the ship and we can see normally again. Some of this might make you thump your television (""come on, you're faulty; they wouldn't make their film look this crap deliberately!"") but it's certainly different. I can't think of any film so brave and experimental in this way. At times it's like a return to the black-and-white era, except that it's blue-and-white. I was a little disappointed here. Visually it looks like a colour film from which the red and green have been leached, making no attempt to do anything with monochrome. Watch a great black-and-white movie and you'll see cinematography which doesn't come naturally to colour. This film went monochrome purely for story reasons rather than artistic ones, which I thought was a shame. Ah well. However the big disappointment is the script. It feels like a short story, with the bare minimum of characterisation and plot required to eke out ninety minutes. The characters are largely differentiated by their accents (American, English, South African, Australian, African, etc.), with little effort expended on creating people we care about. When they start dying, one doesn't give a toss beyond the basic human instinct of ""yikes, death!"". Not good enough. The sole interesting person is the sort-of captain (Radha Mitchell), who's not only good-looking and rather sweet, but gets to make some tough decisions. I liked the way that the end of the film harked back to the beginning... until they underlined it explicitly with a tinted flashback, at which point I rolled my eyes. Still, she's a good character. But of course there's Vin Diesel. The video box boasts that he was in The Fast and the Furious, which is a bad sign for two reasons: (1) personally I wouldn't be too proud of being associated with The Fast and the Furious, and (2) real stars don't need memory-jogs like that. Vin Diesel (weird name!) actually isn't bad. He's got a body that's probably spent more time in the gym than it has in sleep. He has reasonable screen presence, though he wears daft little sunglasses even in the dark. However the character he's playing made me cringe - an armed and dangerous convict, being transported in high security until he escapes! Gosh, I've never seen that hoary old chestnut before! Then the film gives him almost nothing to do for thirty minutes as it tries painfully hard to make him look cool. Eventually he becomes relatively interesting (being the top-billed star part, it was a gimme that he'd get plenty to do) but boy, those first thirty minutes were a millstone around the character's neck. If overmuscled ""I'm-so-scary"" action heroes"

The movie was produced by and starred Vin Diesel as the title character and was written and directed by David Twohy who previously wrote and directed the previous two movies Pitch Black(2000) and The Chronicles of Riddick (2004). The movie is set about nine years after the events of Pitch Black and opens with an alien type of vulture and Riddick (Vin Diesel) speaking about yet again being left for dead, as the vulture examines its seemingly dead prey a hand grasps its neck and slowly strangles it. We soon see a heavily injured Riddick with a broken leg that he set's himself and then finds shelter amongst some old ruins where he can rest. We then get a flash back of Riddick not settling into his life as the lord marshal of the necromonger fleet after the events of The Chronicles of Riddick since he has little interest in believing their faith and thus receives numerous assassination attempts on his life. Straight away we have Riddick set up in Isolation without crowds and others around him and he feels his time as lord marshal has made him incredibly soft and that he ""Lost a step"" so he has to go about going back to the animal that earned him the galaxy's highest bounty. This movie falls more in line with Pitch Black more than Chronicles since we have a deserted planet with very dangerous wildlife, namely those mud demon's, which live in water and have scorpion like tails and pounce on their prey unaware of the poisonous jaws under the water, and of course Merc's and one especially who holds a grudge against Riddick from a previous movie. The movie doesn't really serve as anything really new fans haven't already seen and kind of goes back to the roots of what made these series of movies really good and we end up with a good old fashioned pick-off thriller with Riddick picking off the mercenaries one by one and the local wildlife helping him do so, same as Pitch Black. The older fans, including myself, who have watched Pitch Black would be more inclined to prefer this movie over Chronicles since we get a more animatistic and survivor Riddick, while younger fans and ones who haven't seen the first movie wouldn't really understand the whole reason of why he is isolating himself and what the deal is with his home planet of Furya. Overall the movie wasn't that impressive , I mean sure it had its moments like seeing hunter Riddick again and some nostalgic mentions from the previous two movies in the series but it wasn't something we haven't already seen which wasn't necessarily a bad thing but I'm sure people would have been excited if their had been more about Furya.

Among the survivors is a violent prisoner, Riddick, on his way to another space prison. Add an odd assortment of other survivors, including the ship's navigator, Fry, and Riddick's captor, the bounty hunter Johns, and you have the makings of a creepy and well-told fable that has much to say about the human condition. The washed-out cinematography makes you feel like you're on the triple sun-blasted planet, and you get thirsty just watching the movie. The rag-tag band soon discovers an abandoned mining colony. It's workers apparently left in a hurry-except their escape craft is still there, primed to fly but short a few power cells. Mystery and intrigue lurk, as do nasty, bat-like creatures living in the dark caverns nearby. Three suns means no night. No night means no monsters. No monsters mean safety for all. Right? Wrong. Fry puts two and two together to figure out that they are only hours away from a total solar eclipse, which will plunge the entire planet into darkness. And because all the equipment at the mining colony is solar-powered, they will not have enough light to fend off the beasts of the dark. Throw in the uncertainty of how the condemned prisoner will behave and some really scary chase scenes and you have the makings of a grand sci-fi thriller. Fry, the navigator, has the option on several occasions to abandon her fellow survivors to save her own life, but each time she chooses to put herself in danger to rescue others. The survivors, with one exception, band together in the face of adversity. A key, sympathetically portrayed character is Imam, a Muslim cleric who, with several acolytes, is on the way to a planet called New Mecca when the ship crashes. There are many scenes of Imam praying to Allah and assuring fellow survivors that Allah is still looking out for their welfare. When things look bleakest Imam and Riddick engage in a conversation about how a merciful deity could allow his followers to be put in such a predicament. ""Where is your god?"" Riddick ridicules. ""Why do you pray? It's pointless."" Imam asks Riddick why he does not believe. Riddick replies, ""Oh, I do believe in God, and I absolutely hate him."" Taken out of its Islamic context, a positive lesson can be extracted when Riddick's contempt for and mockery of God are rebuked; when all seems lost, a providential ""accident"" provides the final means of escape. Imam turns to Riddick and says, ""There, Mr. Riddick, is my god."" (An interesting statement considering that Islamic followers do not generally believe in a providential god who intervenes in human affairs.) A female character shows a lot of cleavage as she crawls through a cave opening. A young woman's menstruating becomes a plot point. There is some gore as one victim after another is nabbed by the night creatures, but it's not excessive. Riddick engages in several violent fights with"

But Us, the new mesmerizing mindbender from writer-director-producer Jordan Peele, also carries the weight of expectation. Get Out, Peele's smashing debut from 2017, was a brilliantly caustic satire of race division in America that won Peele an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay (he's the first African-American to triumph in that category) and became a phenom with critics and audiences. How can Peele top that? Short answer: he can't and doesn't. In interviews, Peele insists that Us is a straight-up horror show. Not really. Leave it to Peele to blaze a trail by putting a black family smack in the middle of a commercial thriller-diller. That's more than a novelty, it's a quiet revolution. And Peele's hints at the larger conspiracies of race, class and social violence festering inside the American dream resonate darkly. Ding Peele all you want for taking on more than he can comfortably handle, but this 40-year-old from New York who started as one half of the sketch-comedy team of Key & Peele is now shaping up as a world-class filmmaker. Flaws and all, Us has the power to haunt your waking dreams. You won't be able to stop talking about it.Critics, in mortal fear of the spoiler police, need to shut the fuck up. Or at least tread carefully as Peele introduces the Wilson family of sunny California. Mom Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o), dad Gabe (Winston Duke) and their two kids - Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex) - are on vacation in Santa Cruz. Gabe has an unspoken competition with his friends the Tylers (Elisabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker), a white couple with twin daughters given to conspicuous consumption. Everyone is up for a fun time, especially dad (the excellent Duke - looking much like Peele - gets laughs in the unlikeliest places). But Adelaide is not feeling it. In a chilling prologue, set in 1986, we see Adelaide as a child getting majorly freaked out by a trip to a beachside funhouse containing a hall of mirrors. Now the grown Adelaide is back on the same beach where she was traumatized as a child, and she's taking her own children along. You can cut the foreboding with a knife - or a pair of gold scissors. Scissors figure prominently when the Wilsons are confronted in their driveway by unexpected visitors. Since the scene is included in the film's trailer, I'm not giving away anything to note that these home invaders - clad in red - are exact doubles of the four Wilsons. And the scissors these zombie-like doppelgangers carry are meant to slit throats. ""What the hell are you?"" asks Gabe. The answer is croaked out by Adelaide's evil twin (the only double who speaks) in a voice that induces shudders: ""We're Americans."" The political implications of that genuinely creepy setup are tantalizing, as are the film's allusions to Hands Across America - the 1986 event in which a human chain of millions was"
232,OIM_Doc2_Us,OIM_Doc2_Us,OIM,Horror,Negative,Us,"Let's get this out of the way from the start. I didn't love Us. In a world where Jordan Peele is being hailed as the new master of horror - equal parts Alfred Hitchcock and Wes Craven - that almost feels like blasphemy, but my reasoning is pretty simple. Us isn't the movie we were promised. All that marketing was clearly enough to send fans of Get Out back to movie theaters last weekend in droves, but based on the initial audience response, I'm clearly not the only one. So let's break down a few numbers. Us defied box office expectations to earn $70 million in its opening weekend (nearly twice what the industry predicted), and its Rotten Tomatoes critics score is an impressive 94 percent. However, the movie's audience score is a measly 71 percent, veering dangerously close to ""Rotten"" territory. CinemaScore (a market research company that surveys moviegoers on opening weekends) gave Us a B-rating, which translates to somewhere between ""meh"" and ""bad,"" according to the company's rating system. So what accounts for this disconnect between excitement over Us and the fan reaction after people actually saw it? It may all come down to the marketing, which brilliantly promoted the film as ""a new nightmare from the mind of Academy Award winner Jordan Peele, writer/director of Get Out."" You see, Us wasn't promoted as a must-see film; it was sold as the newest, hottest movie from an increasingly important director. Another big issue with Us and its audience reception may stem from the fact that the trailer promised a very different movie than the one we actually got. Without veering into spoiler territory, early clips promised a horrific home invasion thriller, but as the actual movie plays out, it expands into science fiction territory to rationalize the doppelgangers that antagonize our heroes. To be fair, this seems to be Peele's thing (Get Out takes a similar turn), but this time the twist feels less natural and never really lands. Prepping audiences for the movie's final act with a more accurate trailer could have cushioned that blow. The movie's big twist is entertaining in a pulpy Black Mirror sort of way, but it's also full of plot holes to the point where thinking about the ending causes the entire story to unravel. At one point near the end of Us, a woman sitting behind me in the theater turned to her friend and loudly said, ""This is terrible."" It was hard for me to argue otherwise - even if Peele's story still packs plenty of decent scares and some great comedic moments. As for all of those glowing movie reviews, it can be tough to say why some movies resonate with critics but not fans (or vice versa). In some cases, it's a cult classic that never clicks with the press, while in others, it's just angry white dudes ""review bombing"" a movie for its diverse cast. In this case, the answer seems clear: Movie critics really want Jordan"
233,OIM_Doc3_Us,OIM_Doc3_Us,OIM,Horror,Negative,Us,"Once you get over the disappointment that Jordan Peele's second feature, Us, isn't as trim or impish in its satire as his marvelous debut, Get Out, you can settle back and salute what it is: the most inspiring kind of miss. It's what you want an artist of Peele's sensibility and stature to attempt - to broaden his canvas, deepen his psychological insight, and add new cinematic tools to his kit. However clunky and repetitive, Us continues to demonstrate Peele's understanding that great horror requires metaphors that are insanely great, that might have come to him in dreams of falling into a ""sunken place"" or, in this film, into a parallel subterranean world denuded of all material pleasures. Imagine Alice's White Rabbit down and out and eaten away by deprivation. Imagine that it's a white lab rabbit. Imagine a fusion of Lewis Carroll, George Orwell, and James Baldwin - plus arterial spray. So much here to love. Peele's opening is up there with the nightmare classics. After titles that assert there are thousands of miles of tunnels under the U.S., many of which ""have no known purpose at all,"" we're in a beachside Santa Cruz amusement park in 1986, where a little girl wanders away while her father is distracted by a game of Whac-a-Mole. (What better metaphor for macho futility?) Gothic convention compels the girl to enter a fun house on the beach with a sign reading vision quest: find yourself. In the hall of mirrors, she nervously whistles ""Itsy Bitsy Spider"" - and then hears someone whistling it back. What appears to be her mirror image is actually ... well, that's the question. The credit sequence that follows is diabolically brilliant: The camera rests on a white rabbit, then slowly pulls back to reveal a cage and then a vast wall of cages, each with its own leporine specimen. Michael Abels's blend of The Omen-like Latin chants and polyphonic Afro-rhythms is so infectious you don't even realize that by tapping your feet you're helping to conjure the devil. It possesses you, this music. The first scenes lose the pulse, though, and the film never really recovers. In the present, the reasonably prosperous Wilson family goes to Santa Cruz for a vacation, its arrival broken by flashbacks to '86 and the aftermath of the little girl's trip to the fun house, when she's mute, apparently in shock. The connection is Adelaide Wilson, who was once that little girl and is now a jittery mom played by Lupita Nyong'o. Adelaide is nervous about going back to the beach, which is easy to understand - but then why is she there in the first place? Peele's writing is blah and perfunctory, especially when Adelaide's husband, Gabe (Winston Duke), shows up with a powerboat he bought in a vain attempt to keep up with the Tylers (Elisabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker) and their much fancier house and athletic blonde daughters. The Wilson kids, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex), are"

That phrase, delivered in a deathless, deadpan drawl, echoes through the twists and turns of a movie whose very title slyly evokes the common abbreviation for United States. Having taken a scalpel to the covert racism of gliberal America in Get Out, writer-director Jordan Peele turns his gaze inward for this rip-roaring follow-up, which is fearsomely entertaining, consistently thought-provoking and occasionally bloody scary. A Twilight Zone mashup of Dostoevsky's The Double and Jack Finney's The Body Snatchers, spiced up once again by a wit reminiscent of vintage Ira Levin, it's a modern fable that locates our anxieties about outsiders in a guilty fear of ourselves. The result plays like a mirror-image riposte to the French-Romanian home-invasion horror Ils (Them), suggesting that, contrary to Sartre, hell is not other people; it is us. ""There are thousands of miles of tunnels beneath the continental US,"" declares the film's ominous opening statement. ""Many have no known purpose at all."" This sets the unsettling scene for a 1986 prologue in which a young girl in a Thriller T-shirt wanders away from her parents at a Santa Cruz beach fairground. Entering the Vision Quest hall of mirrors, the child sees something terrifying and traumatising - or is it just her own reflection? Thirtysomething years later, the adult Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong'o) returns to that same beach with her family: goofy husband Gabe (Winston Duke); argumentative teen daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph); and anxious son Jason (Evan Alex), who hides his face behind a monster mask. Haunted by her childhood, Adelaide has ""a hard time just talking"", particularly in the company of the Tylers, the dysfunctional white family whom Gabe envies but the rest of his brood merely tolerate. ""I don't feel like myself,"" Adelaide insists, pleading to leave the summer home that is bringing back so many memories. But when a shadowy family arrive on the Wilsons' doorstep, it soon becomes clear that they can run, but they can't hide from themselves. There are enjoyable arguments to be had regarding what Us is really ""about"". Is it a classic return-of-the-repressed tale in the manner of Jekyll and Hyde (everyone has a shadow, a dark side) or a broader parable about affluent society's parasitical relationship with a hidden underclass, like Wes Craven's underrated The People Under the Stairs? Crucially, Peele allows his audience to play it both ways - to decide for themselves what's so scary about these subterranean visions and the spectres they bring forth. Slipping nimbly between the registers of domestic sitcom and sociopolitical shocker, Us takes time to establish its family dynamics before throwing the Wilsons (and us, the audience) to the wolves. It's time well spent, ensuring a deep emotional investment in the characters that keeps us tethered to them even as the narrative descends into madness. Throughout, the attention to small details gives the bigger picture clout - the bickering dinner-table conversations that concisely establish each character's strengths and weakness; the throwaway comments that cleverly set up a late-in-the-day"

Although they cry out to me, I will not listen to them."" - Jeremiah 11:11. In Rodney Ascher's documentary ""Room 237,"" four theorists attempt to explain the hidden messages in Stanley Kubrick's movie ""The Shining."" The ideas about what the movie is about range from the possible to the downright bizarre. One theory fixates on the possibility that ""The Shining"" was Kubrick's way of confessing he faked the landing on the moon footage, and another obsesses over the details of the hedge maze. The other two see evidence that the 1980 film indirectly references either the genocide of Native Americans or the Holocaust. Like ""The Shining,"" there are a number of different ways to interpret Jordan Peele's excellent new horror movie, ""Us."" Every image seems to be a clue for what's about to happen or a stand-in for something outside the main story of a family in danger. Peele's film, which he directed, wrote and produced, will likely reward audiences on multiple viewings, each visit revealing a new secret, showing you something you missed before in a new light. ""Us"" begins back in 1986 with a young girl and her parents wandering through the Santa Cruz boardwalk at night. She separates from them to walk out on the empty beach, watching a foreboding flock of thunderclouds roll in. Her eyes find an attraction just off the main pier, and she walks into what looks like an abandoned hall of mirrors, discovering something deeply terrifying-her doppelganger. The movie shifts to the present day, with Janelle Monae on the radio as the Wilson family is heading towards their vacation home. The little girl has now grown up to be a woman, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o), nervous about returning to that spot on the Santa Cruz beach. Her husband, Gabe (Winston Duke), thinks her reaction is overblown, but he tries to make her feel at ease so they can take their kids Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex) to the beach and meet up with old friends, the Tylers (Elisabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker) and their twin daughters. After one small scare and a few strange coincidences on the beach, the family returns home for a quiet night in, only to have their peace broken by a most unlikely set of trespassers lined up across their driveway: doppelgangers of their family. Part of the appeal of ""Us"" is how you interpret what all of this information and images mean. No doubt the movie will give audiences plenty to mull over long after the credits. In the film, the Jeremiah 11:11 Bible verse appears twice before pivotal moments, and there are plenty of other Biblical references to dig into, including an analogy to heaven and hell. Perhaps Jason's ""Jaws"" shirt is a reference to the rocket sweater the little boy wears in ""The Shining"" or it could be a warning about the film's oceanside dangers. In"

With the ambitious home-invasion horror chiller Us, Peele goes even deeper into the conflicted territory of class and race and privilege; he also ponders the traits that make us most human. But this time, he's got so many ideas he can barely corral them, let alone connect them. He overthinks himself into a corner, and we're stuck there with him. Lupita Nyong'o stars as Adelaide, who has overcome a traumatic childhood experience and now has a family of her own, including husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and two kids: graceful, well-adjusted Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and the slightly more awkward Jason (Evan Alex), who wears a wolfman mask pushed up on his head as a kind of security blanket. We meet the comfortably middle-class Wilson family as they're heading off on vacation to Santa Cruz, the site of Adelaide's childhood ordeal. On their first night away, they look out and see a family of four, mute and stony echoes of themselves, standing in the driveway. From there, Peele unspools a story of ""shadow"" people, long forced to live underground but now streaming to the Earth's surface to claim, violently, what they feel is rightfully theirs. The effectiveness of Us may depend on how little you know about it going in, so the spoiler-averse may wish to stop reading here. But it's impossible to address any of the movie's larger ideas without giving away key plot points: Before long, that shadow family has infiltrated the house, and now that we can get a good look, we see that each of them is a not-quite-right replica of a Wilson, dressed in a red jumpsuit and wielding a pair of menacing-looking shears. At one point a terrified Adelaide asks the other mother, a twin of herself but with vacant, crazy eyes and a demented smile, ""What are you people?"" ""We are Americans,"" the lookalike responds, in a whispery growl. That's a bright, neon-lit Author's Message if ever there was one, though the idea of using a group of sunlight-deprived semi-zombies as a metaphorical element in a parable about class complacency isn't necessarily a bad one. Are you and your family doing great? Do you live in a nice place, drive an expensive car, and have plenty of food for everyone to eat? Be grateful for it. But be aware that there are others who, through no fault of their own, don't live at the same comfort level-or are, in fact, barely surviving. (The Wilsons also have close friends, Josh and Kitty, played by Tim Heidecker and Elisabeth Moss, who have more money and nicer stuff than they do, a source of irritation for Gabe in particular, and another of the movie's threads about class consciousness in America.) But Peele doesn't always lay out his"
237,OIM_Doc7_Us,OIM_Doc7_Us,OIM,Horror,Positive,Us,"The success of Jordan Peele's 2017 film, ""Get Out,"" bought him time, he said, in a recent interview with Le Monde-for his new film, ""Us,"" he had twice as many shoot days. The expanded time frame allowed him to produce a work of expanded ambition: ""Us"" bounces back and forth between 1986 and the present day, and its action, compared to ""Get Out,"" has a vast range-geographical, dramatic, and intellectual. The movie's imaginative spectrum is enormous, four-dimensionally so: it delves deep into a literal underground world that lends the hallucinatory concept of the ""sunken place"" from ""Get Out"" a physical embodiment. And it captures the transformative, radical power of a political conscience, of an idea long held in secret, as it ripens and develops over decades' worth of time. ""Us"" is nothing short of a colossal achievement. Structured like a home-invasion drama, ""Us"" is a horror film-though saying so is like offering a reminder that ""The Godfather"" is a gangster film or that ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is science fiction. Genre is irrelevant to the merits of a film, whether its conventions are followed or defied; what matters is that Peele cites the tropes and precedents of horror in order to deeply root his film in the terrain of pop culture-and then to pull up those roots. ""Us"" is a film that places itself within pop culture for diagnostic-and even self-diagnostic-purposes; its subject is, in large measure, cultural consciousness and its counterpart, the cultural unconscious. The crucial element of horror is political and moral-the realities that metaphorical fantasies evoke. Peele reaches deep into the symbolic DNA of pop culture to discover a hidden, implicit history that he brings to the fore, at a moment of growing recognition that the deeds of the past still rage with silent and devastating force in the present time. After a title card notes the presence of a vast hidden network of tunnels (as for abandoned railways and mines) beneath American soil, the action begins with a bit of pop archeology: a shot of an old-fashioned tube TV set, on which a commercial is playing for ""Hands Across America,"" a 1986 philanthropic fund-raising event that involved an effort to create a human chain from coast to coast. (The announcer's voice-over says, ""Six million people will tether themselves together to fight hunger in America."") At that time, a young girl named Adelaide (though her name isn't heard until much later in the film, when she's an adult) is visiting a Santa Cruz beach with her squabbling parents. The child (Madison Curry) wanders off, enters a beachside haunted-house attraction, and, there, walking through a hall of mirrors reminiscent of the one in Orson Welles's ""The Lady from Shanghai,"" sees not her reflection but her physical double. After the incident, her parents find her traumatized, but just what happened isn't clear to them. In the present day, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) is married to Gabe Wilson (Winston Duke), and they have two children, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph), a teen-ager,"
238,OIM_Doc8_Us,OIM_Doc8_Us,OIM,Horror,Positive,Us,"Jordan Peele's Us, its title signals, is not a movie from which we as viewers can be detached. It demands from the start that we recognize an uncomfortable fact: Out in the audience, we're part of the story. And it's a movie about doubles and doppelgangers, so of course the title is pulling double allegorical duty. Peele is a walking pop culture encyclopedia, especially horror and science fiction (he's hosting and producing CBS's Twilight Zone reboot, which premieres on April 1). So there's no way he named his Get Out follow-up without self-conscious reference to Them!, the 1954 sci-fi film in which a nest of giant irradiated ants threatens Americans from tunnels beneath New Mexico, a recompense (a voiceover at the end tells us) for the hubris of the atomic age. The title also obviously signals that this movie is about us - first-person plural, audience and filmmakers alike - but with some additional specificity: US = United States. As one of the characters rasps once the film cranks into gear, ""We are Americans."" Us is a movie about America. Rife with symbols and encroaching apocalyptic dread, Us is a big, ambitious fable about how a society develops willful amnesia, then tears itself to pieces. Like last year's Hereditary and the upcoming The Lodge, it's horror cosplaying as family drama. But unlike those movies, Us's target isn't intimate; it's a whole nation that doesn't want to remember the less savory parts of history. It also works best if you don't try to pick it apart too much and stitch together a coherent mythology. Us is likely to frustrate people who crave plot points that can be coherently explained and mapped explicitly, directly onto the real world. In this way, it feels less expertly crafted than Get Out, though also more ripe for rewatching, considering from new angles; your mileage may vary. And what people see reflected in the film may say less about the film than it does about themselves. (It's no accident that some posters for the film feature inkblot imagery to clearly mimic a Rorschach test.) But no matter who's watching, the movie is richly entertaining and unnerving. Us is more intuitive than explicatory, more visceral than diagrammatic; it's horrific in a way that hangs onto your gut when it's all over.Us turns a family trip to the beach into nightmare. Humans seem to find copies of themselves terrifying. Traditionally, seeing your doppelganger means death is nigh; in some cultures and times, twins have been considered so unlucky that one in a pair is killed after birth. So it's quite frightening when, at the beginning of the film, young Adelaide (Madison Curry) - a child visiting a boardwalk amusement park on the Santa Cruz beach with her bickering parents in 1986 - wanders away into a funhouse and, in the hall of mirrors, is confronted by her own self. Not a reflection of herself. A copy of herself. In the present day, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) is on vacation"
239,OIM_Doc9_Us,OIM_Doc9_Us,OIM,Horror,Negative,Us,"Watching the new film Us, Jordan Peele's hotly anticipated follow-up to his Oscar-winning smash hit Get Out, got me thinking about Magnolia-Paul Thomas Anderson's hotly anticipated follow-up to his defining second film, Boogie Nights-which will have its 20th anniversary this year. Like Magnolia, Us arrives blessed with a bigger budget and laden with the hope that the director, in all his newfound freedom to explore and express the landscape of his mind, will deliver the next great gospel. What results from all that expectation, one founded on a still-molten legacy, is a mad riot of ideas and motifs, a messy gush of a movie. As Magnolia did two decades ago, Us does now. Only, Magnolia made engaging, legible enough art out of its abundance. Us, on the other hand, is a frustrating movie, oddly inert despite all its thrashing. It's a jumble of fascinating threads that Peele fails to weave together. It's what you might call a junk-drawer movie, a collage of bits and bobs that have cluttered Peele's brilliant mind for long enough that he thought he might try to synthesize them all into one movie. But the ball of rubber bands doesn't really speak to the bottle-opener thingy; the eyeglass screwdriver doesn't have much to do with the Ethernet cable. Each item has its own value, sure, but they don't form a whole equal to the sum of the parts. Us is about a lot of things-or, rather, indicates toward a lot of things, without really being fully about any of them. It concerns a family-mom Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o), dad Gabe (Nyong'o's Black Panther co-star Winston Duke), daughter Zora (the remarkably expressive Shahadi Wright Joseph), and son Jason (Evan Alex)-on vacation together. They drive a nice car, and the family home they're staying in, near the coast of California, is well-appointed. They seem happy, prosperous. But just beneath the surface is an unease. Adelaide is wary of the whole trip; as a child, she had a mysterious experience at a beachside amusement park, a lingering trauma that sets the early notes of dread in Us. That ominous scene, a prologue taking place in 1986, is really well staged. Peele is an inventive visual filmmaker, tilting his actors' heads and bodies at curious angles (he does this throughout, to sometimes breathtaking effect), and imbuing his pictures with a kind of saturated glare. This opening sequence, when young Adelaide (Madison Curry) goes wandering alone into the beginnings of a nightmare, suggests that Us is headed somewhere focused and gripping, a fable of innocence lost and a dark world uncorked. The movie starts with such promise. But as Peele gradually lays out the mechanics and components of Us, that early jolt dissipates. Us is, I think, among other things, a vague statement on inequity and class struggle, framed as a sort of unconscious Eloi vs. Morlocks system of oppression that breaks into terrible rebellion. That's certainly a worthy allegory to tackle in this age of economic and social atomization. But Peele"
240,OIM_Doc10_Us,OIM_Doc10_Us,OIM,Horror,Negative,Us,"Has Jordan Peele done it again? A better question might be, why would he need to? Peele's 2017 debut Get Out was the kind of film that comes along once in a generation-a horror movie with galvanic timing, an expertly turned entertainment that seemed to explain our country to us at a moment when we needed explanations. Racial politics, class tensions, the ""sunken place""-Get Out set Peele up as not just a talented filmmaker, but as something of an American oracle. His new film Us, which opens tomorrow, seems intended to upend those expectations. It has been shrouded in mystery, but it delighted audiences with a ghoulish trailer and at SXSW last month when it premiered. It's easy to see why: Us is propulsive, studded with nightmarish imagery, well acted, visceral, and violent, gripping from end to end. It is also confounding. Get Out had clarity and impeccable control. Us careens wildly, raising question after question, answering precious few of them. But is it scary? Yes. A family of four arrives at their summer home in Santa Cruz, California. The father, Gabe Wilson (played by Winston Duke), is an amiable doof; Adelaide, the mother (played by Lupita Nyong'o, who owns this film), is edgy, haunted by memories of something that happened to her at a local funhouse as a girl. At the beach their son, Jason, wanders off and encounters a vagrant standing near that same funhouse, his fingers dripping with blood. The sequence is classic first-act horror, shrouded in dread. That night a family of doppelgangers arrives in the driveway, holding hands, standing motionless in a spill of streetlight. It is an indelible image, and a hinge point in the film (light spoilers to come). These menacing doubles, carrying shears, moving twitchily, the son's face covered in a grotesque white mask, are. . .demons? Manifestations of the Wilsons's id? Runaways from some mental institution (they wear jumpsuits and sandals)? All of the above? They speak in grunts and groans, except for Adelaide's double, who croaks out words. They leer, and they kill-but not the Wilsons, who manage one improbable escape after another. Other denizens of Santa Cruz are not so lucky, including the Wilsons's friends, another family of four (Elisabeth Moss and Tim Heidecker are the parents), who are dispatched in sprays of blood. Can the doppelgangers be killed? Apparently, though one survives a drowning and another a golf club to the head. And why do some, not all, mirror the behavior of their opposites? What do they want? Are they everywhere? Or only in Santa Cruz? At some point I wrote in my notes, Will any of this be explained? A queasiness had set in, that unease of suspecting that you are not in the steadiest of hands. I wondered if Peele had sacrificed logic for effect. Us is about us. (One of the doubles says, ""We are Americans."") And about tunnels, bunnies, ballet, and hiding in plain sight. It's a funhouse of conflicting narratives-an enigma, chaotic throughout."

Let's not confuse Dong with Vinny, however, who would literally cry if the breeze hit him the wrong way. Dong would really only cry when we teased him and we soon found, as little shit kids love to do, the easiest way to push the poor lad to tears. ""Dong, the gypsies are coming,"" we would chant. ""The gypsies are coming to take to you away."" Even though we had no idea what a gypsy was or why they were purported to steal children, such provocation turned Dong into a blubbering mess. Once he even threw at chair when someone pushed him too hard. I hope to hell that poor Dong does not see Drag Me to Hell, Sam Raimi's return to the splatter flick genre that made him famous after years making mainstream blockbusters such as Spider-Man. See, Drag Me to Hell features one very pissed off Gypsy woman who, like all Gypsies must do in horror films, curses poor Alison Lohman's Christine after she refuses to grant her an extension on her housing loan. More a comedy-horror in the vein of Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness rather than a film created to inspire fear in the hearts of intrepid viewers, Drag Me to Hell allows Raimi the opportunity to return to his old tricks of Three Stooges-type body humor and a chance to play with beasties that spew goo and like to scream in distorted voices. See, poor Christine isn't all bad. A momentary lapse of better judgment and the desire to wrest a promotion away from a brown-nosing, shitbag colleague (Reggie Lee) informs her decision to foreclose on the Gypsy's house. Call it the wrong place at the wrong time, but this choice gets Christine a one-way curse to hell when her despondent client sics an angry demon on her ass. Unfortunately, Lohman does not possess the natural charisma Bruce Campbell brought to the Evil Dead series and her ersatz charm is not enough to carry the picture. Supporting players like boyfriend Clay (Mac-guy Justin Long) and spiritual guru Rham (Dileep Rao) have neither the acting chops nor the script to be anything more than incidental characters. So the entire production rests on the shoulders of Lohman and her battle against an invisible goat-demon named the Lamia. Raimi will never be a great filmmaker, but Drag Me to Hell is more a series of squirm-inducing scenes than a cohesive film. Sure, there are plenty of gross-out scenes (including a classic battle between Christine and the Gypsy in a moving car), but rather than amount to a film that really chills the bones, Raimi mixes ""gotcha!"" moments with scenes so over the top, there is nothing to do but laugh. Drag Me to Hell will never be more than a minor work in Raimi's oeuvre, mainly because it's really nothing new for him. After the"
242,RPT_Doc2_dragmetohell,RPT_Doc2_dragmetohell,RPT,Horror,Positive,Drag me to hell,"It was 2009, and some people were starting to forget a few things about Sam Raimi. He'd made his name in the horror genre with the Evil Dead movies, but he also branched out to other genres in the 90s, with the western The Quick and the Dead, the crime thriller A Simple Plan, and the romantic drama For Love of the Game. In the early 2000s, Raimi thrilled nerds once again (well, mostly) with the Spider-Man movies, which gave audiences a profitable, family-friendly superhero far before the Marvel Cinematic Universe rose to prominence. But if audiences forgot this was the same director who brought us some of cinema's most hilariously disgusting horror, Raimi reminded us with the movie Drag Me to Hell, a delicious slice of wicked B-movie fun. The tagline for the movie pulled no punches. The poster tells us, ""Christine Brown has a good job, a great boyfriend, and a bright future. But in three days, she's going to hell."" In other words, this could potentially be any of us who made a bad decision and got far more than they bargained for. 2009 was probably the only time Drag Me to Hell could've ended the way it did, with (spoiler!) protagonist Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) literally dragged to hell. True, Christine may be a loan officer (which is right up there with IRS workers in terms of most despised on-screen professions), but it's easy for us to see ourselves in her struggles, making her both sympathetic and easy to root for. There's a slot for a cushy position at work, and she's competing against a backstabbing colleague for it. Christine also has to deal with underappreciation and sexism, with her boss asking her to grab him a sandwich on her lunch break. It's eventually revealed that Christine worked her way up from a harsh rural childhood with an alcoholic mother, and her loving boyfriend Clay (Justin Long) is being pressured to date someone with a higher social and financial status. So when Christine is told that the right person for the promotion is the one who can make ""tough decisions,"" it's deeply understandable why she chose to deny the elderly Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) a third extension on her mortgage, even after Mrs. Ganush begs on her knees. The problem is, she turns out to be a gypsy, and places a terrible curse on Christine, summoning an evil demon called the Lamia, which torments its victim over the course of three days, then literally drags them to hell. The effects become apparent immediately, quickly escalating from mysterious voices to outright violence. Be warned: Drag Me to Hell is a scary movie that's actually scary, and there's no doubt that Christine's torment is real. This is a shadowy, evil, force sends Christine horrifying, disgusting dreams that involve flies, vomiting, and worms. The Lamia is also physically violent, punching Christine in the face and throwing her through the air. It also seems to know when it would be"

Now comes the latest entry, ""Up,"" a delightful and touching experience that isn't just one of the best films from the studio - it's the best film to date in 2009. ""Up"" tells the story of Carl Fredricksen, a 78-year-old who sets his sights on his lifelong dream - a trip to Paradise Falls in South America - by tying thousands of balloons to his house and floating to his destination. Shortly after liftoff, Carl discovers he has an unwanted traveling companion - a young Wilderness Explorer named Russell (Jordan Nagai). When a storm veers Carl and Russell slightly off course, the duo begin to walk toward their intended destination - hoping to get the house to Paradise Falls before the balloons run out of helium. There is plenty to like about ""Up"" - from its gorgeous look to a surprisingly touching story. The opening 10 minutes are some of the best, and most emotional, sequences of any film in recent memory, but are just the beginning of a movie that manages to interject some laugh-out-loud funny moments with a rather tender back story that tugs at the heart strings. Asner is very good as Carl, while Christopher Plummer does a nice job as Charles Muntz - Carl's childhood idol who has remained in exile in his quest to find an exotic animal in the South American rain forest. (Muntz's pack of talking dogs provides some of the biggest laughs in the movie). There isn't a wasted moment in ""Up"" - making it that rare film that transcends its genre and creates an experience that can be enjoyed by moviegoers of all ages. Also in theaters For audiences looking for a slightly darker film there's ""Drag Me to Hell"" (B) - Sam Raimi's absurdly entertaining return to his horror roots. Despite its PG-13 rating, this is a movie that horror fans will love - full of dark humor, gross out moments and even a few scares. ""Hell"" follows Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), a loan officer looking to get a big promotion. To impress her bosses, she shows she is capable of making the ""tough decisions"" - evicting an elderly woman (Lorna Raver) from her home despite the woman's pleas for compassion. Unfortunately for Christine, the decision proves to be a potentially fatal one when the lady attacks her in the bank's parking lot and puts a supernatural curse on her. Raimi, the man behind the ""Evil Dead"" movies, has always had a twisted eye when it comes to horror. Thankfully, he brings that approach to this project - creating a film that features as many laughs as it does scary moments. The cast is fine, including Lohman and Justin Long as Christine's fiance, but this is a film that clearly gets its lift from Raimi. The co-writer/director spares no expense to entertain his audience, with no possible plot thread too taboo"
244,RPT_Doc4_dragmetohell,RPT_Doc4_dragmetohell,RPT,Horror,Positive,Drag me to hell,"For much of his career, Sam Raimi was a cult director best known for his madcap horror trilogy of Evil Dead films. Then, amazingly, the filmmaker whose highest grossing movie of his career didn't even top $40 million at the domestic box office was given the reins to the iconic Marvel character Spider-Man. There was a demand for comic book movies at the time but Raimi's Spider-Man was such a smash hit that it brought superhero cinema into a full-fledged pop culture phenomenon. After a successful trilogy that pulled in well over a billion dollars in the North America alone, Raimi moved on from the web-slinger. His first movie after the greatest successes of his career would be Drag Me to Hell, a movie Raimi co-wrote with his brother Ivan and would see the director returning to his horror roots. Nine years after its release, Drag Me to Hell lands on Blu-ray with a new special edition from the dedicated horror nuts at Scream Factory, an edition that honors this often overlooked example of purely distilled Sam Raimi cinema. The plot for Drag Me to Hell is straightforward and to the point. Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is piecing her life together living in Los Angeles. She works as a loan officer at a bank with her eyes set on a promotion to assistant manager. Christine is dating a young doctor Clay (Justin Long). Things are on the upswing for the somewhat shy young woman. That is until Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver) enters the bank one day seeking an extension on her home loan. At that moment Christine is presented with a choice to make. Eager for that promotion, Christine decides to try and impress her boss and reject Mrs. Ganush's extension. That evening, as Christine walks out to her car, she's attacked by a belligerent Ganush and the scuffle ends with the old gypsy placing a curse on Christine. The evil spirit of the Lamia will haunt her for three days until it finally burst through this earthly plane and will drag Christine to Hell where she'll be tortured through eternity. Sam Raimi brings such an efficiency to the horror of Drag Me to Hell, knowing exactly where he's taking his characters and easily guiding the story along to horrific moment after horrific moment. Since the film is dealing with a deadly supernatural entity, Sam and Ivan Raimi allow the character of the spiritualist Rham Jas (Dileep Rao) to serve as the main channel of expository dialogue. There's this perfect balance between not over-explaining the events of the film while still pulling the audience into this twisted world of demons from Hell. More importantly, Sam Raimi knows what you want out of a movie entitled Drag Me to Hell and, dammit, he's going to give it to you. The horror filmmaking of Sam Raimi is very much like a rollercoaster ride. First there's a jolt to get your attention. Then the terror twists and turns with escalating dread and ease"
245,RPT_Doc5_dragmetohell,RPT_Doc5_dragmetohell,RPT,Horror,Positive,Drag me to hell,"If you were to tell a horror fan in the '80s or '90s that Sam Raimi would go on to make one of the most expensive films of all time (2007's Spider-Man 3, for the record - its final cost was just under $300m), they probably wouldn't believe you. Likewise, if you were to tell them that at a certain point in time (now) that the only film he had directed in nearly a decade was a mega-budget Wizard of Oz sequel, they'd be even more incredulous; hell, I've witnessed it myself and I still have trouble believing that one. But this time traveler with fairly useless information could calm that horror fan by telling them that, in 2009, right between those two blank check, family-friendly productions, he would at long last return to the horror genre to make a relatively low budget spiritual successor to Evil Dead 2 titled Drag Me To Hell. Even better, that film would prove his long time away from such fare didn't leave him too rusty to live up to the expectations one might have for such an event. Like fellow surprise blockbuster-maker Peter Jackson, Raimi got his start making cheap movies with his friends, letting his talent speak for itself instead of hiding it behind big stars and all the 3D visuals $200m+ budgets can provide. It was this ""See what he can do with nothing - now imagine what he can do with lots and lots of money!"" thinking that led him to the studio system in the '90s, where his output was generally well-liked but rarely successful at the box office (oddly, his biggest grosser before Spider-Man was For Love of the Game, a costly dud that almost no one would recognize as one of his films without reading the credits). Despite his financially iffy track record, he secured the lucrative Spider-Man gig and gave Sony its biggest hit ever, followed by two very successful sequels, and after doing those films more or less back to back he could presumably walk into any studio in town and get something greenlit because the marketing could rest on ""From the director of the Spider-Man trilogy"" on the trailers and posters. So what did he do? He made Drag Me To Hell, which embraced his passion for both slapstick and gooey liquids in equal measure - a rare horror comedy that seems determined to split that bill evenly. Yes, this can lead to the occasional less-than-graceful shift in tone, but Raimi's glee from behind the camera practically becomes visible onscreen, keeping it from ever being an issue. Or at least it does for me; I knew a few folks who don't like the film and I feel sad for them, as they are denying themselves pure cinematic joy from a guy who was clearly relishing being back on a small production again, without a dozen producers telling him what to do (*cough* Venom *cough*) and the pressure of living up to two of the"

But he and his sibling go to considerable cliched length to elicit fellow-feeling for ill-fated lead character Christine Brown. Right at the beginning of the film, they show the lean, perky Brown (played by a very game Alison Lohman) passing by a window display of yummy pastries on her way to work. She looks at it longingly, then walks by. Angling for a promotion at her soulless bank job, she denies a loan extension for a decidedly sinister-looking gypsy woman who delivers her hell-condemning curse in a ridiculously slam-bang underground parking lot confrontation.

Sure, it's fun that Raimi took a break from counting his Spider-Man loot to bang out a quickie slasher strongly reminiscent of his Evil Dead beginnings. But couldn't Drag Me to Hell, which Raimi co-wrote with his bro Ivan, have been just a little bit more imaginative? Apart from the evocative title, which is a great nod to '50s drive-in fare, the film is as predictable as a meal beneath the golden arches. Demonic possession unleashed by strange incantation? Check. Buckets of gore and various flavours of vomit? Check. 1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88 gratuitously used as prop? Check. Plot written on back of postcard? Check and double check. In many ways it's Evil Dead 4, which may explain the critical huzzahs from Cannes to California, with a gender flip for minor variety. This time, the dead-dodging protagonist is a woman, rather than the hapless hero played so memorably and hilariously by Raimi regular Bruce Campbell. Pity that the woman is Alison Lohman, a woeful actress who seems to have been chosen solely for her resemblance to Spider-Man's Kirsten Dunst (Raimi is one freaky cat). As much as I enjoy the thought of Lohman being dragged to hell - I hold her responsible for the failure of Atom Egoyan's Where the Truth Lies - she's as exciting to watch as a sack of hammers. Her character Christine is just too dumb and innocent to warrant the supernatural abuse dealt out to her after she unwittingly runs afoul of a vengeful gypsy crone named Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver). Eager to prove to her grasping bank boss (David Paymer) that she has the cojones to dodge bad loans, Christine's bad timing has her turning down a mortgage extension for Mrs. Ganush when the old hag comes begging. For acting like a bureaucrat rather than a saint, Christine's punishment is to spend the next 90 minutes attempting to dodge the curse of the Lamia, a body-snatching entity from hell that holds big-time grudges and won't take ""no"" for an answer. Not even the blood sacrifice suggested by a street-corner swami (Dileep Rao) appeases the grabby ghouls. (Note to cat lovers: be ready to gaze downward into popcorn bag.) One might argue Christine is already facing perpetual damnation by agreeing to marry her drippy boyfriend Clay (Justin Long), who takes forever to figure things out. Having Lohman and Long co-starring in the same movie is like being banished to the cinema circle of Dante's Inferno. Part of the problem with Drag Me to Hell is that it's not 1981 anymore, the year The Evil Dead rebooted the horror genre. Special effects have gotten a whole lot less special in the intervening decades. Raimi used to have to use ingenuity to get his lo-fi shocks; now he just has to flip a computer switch. But my biggest beef with Drag"

Perhaps, then, it shouldn't be routinely dismissed as just another tale of demons and ghosts that has been emasculated with the goal of appealing to pimple-faced teenagers who haven't figured out how to sneak into legitimate R-rated features. Raimi, despite having become sidetracked by a certain web-slinging superhero in recent years, has legitimate horror credentials. Not only is his Evil Dead trilogy considered a horror milestone, but he's the only director to have gotten Katie Holmes to doff her top. That alone has to count for something although, had The Gift been rated PG-13, Katie's assets would have remained concealed. So has Raimi achieved the Holy Grail? Has he made a horror film that chills and thrills yet is mild enough to allow admittance to comers of all ages? Sadly, no. But wait... all is not lost. Although Drag Me to Hell mostly fails as horror, it achieves sporadic success as a comedy. The conundrum lies in locating the line of demarcation between intentional and unintentional humor. With Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness, Raimi demonstrated that he enjoys spiking his blood and gore with satire, wit, and the Three Stooges. Some of that is in evidence here. Unfortunately, there are also times when the direction and acting are so ham-fisted that intended scares provoke chortles instead of gasps. Even if one shifts mindset and looks at Drag Me to Hell as pure satire, its effectiveness is middling. It feels bloated and overlong and the occasional bursts of laughter don't warrant a 100-minute investment of time. Loan officer Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is vying with a co-worker for the vacant position of assistant manager. She needs the promotion not only to secure her future but to impress the parents of her boyfriend, Clay (Justin Long), who think she's not good enough for their son. The bank manager, Mr. Jacks (David Paymer), delights in playing Christine against her rival and watching the sparks fly. One day, a crone with the improbable name of Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) comes to the bank asking for relief from a mortgage she can't pay. She's behind on her payments and is about to lose her house. Mr. Jacks leaves the resolution of the matter to Christine and she decides to take the hard-line to demonstrate her toughness. Mrs. Ganush does not react well to this. A verbal confrontation leads to a physical alteration which culminates in the old woman leveling a curse at Christine's jacket button. Soon thereafter, Christine begins having disturbing visitations by things that go bump in the night, and she solicits the aid of a mystic (Dileep Rao) to rid her of the curse and its associated devil who, after three days of haunting her, will claim her soul and drag her bodily to hell. Before that, she has a conversation with a talking goat and a life-and-death struggle with a psychotic handkerchief. If one wants"

At the very least, it should inspire a banquet of dread or offer a canape of anxiety. After Drag Me to Hell you won't mind walking home alone. You might even welcome a dark, deserted alley. It could help alleviate the anger of knowing you've been had. This is surprising, since Drag Me to Hell is the creation of writer-director Sam Raimi, whose body of work has been dedicated to turning more than one viewer's hair white with the Evil Dead and Spider-Man franchises. The only thing he's likely to turn a viewer to this time is the door marked exit. For God only knows what reason, it begins with a prelude staged in 1969 in Pasadena. A kid steals a necklace from a gypsy wagon and takes refuge in one of those old houses that look like W. C. Fields lived there. The doors slam open; people fall to their deaths; the floor opens and sucks the little thief into a cauldron of flames; and the house goes back to looking like a silent-film set. Forty years later, a pretty loan officer in a California bank named Christine Brown (Alison Lohman, sometimes unfairly confused with Lindsay Lohan) refuses to extend a delinquent loan to an ancient hag with one eye and a mouth full of black incisors who has an epileptic fit in the middle of the bank and puts a curse on the young career girl. The nightmare begins. The crone attacks her in the underground parking garage, wrecks her car and rips a button from her coat. Soon she hears the same voices the little boy heard back in 1969. A bug crawls into her nose in the middle of the night. The next day at work she spews blood all over the bank. Her boyfriend (Justin Long) pooh-poohs the whole thing, until she bakes a harvest cake to impress his snobby parents and a human eye pops out of the batter with the kind of ensuing dinner-table chaos that guarantees a short engagement with no need for the bridal registry at Bloomingdale's. Seeking the help of a loopy carnival medium, Christine finds herself up to her pierced ears in corpse vomit, animal sacrifice, violent seances and open graves. Nothing stops the curse. The road to deliverance leads to the same old house in Pasadena containing the doorway to hell, but the movie doesn't end there. There's still a preposterous finale in a grotesque cemetery that tickles the funny bone more than it assaults the nervous system. Sound effects play an important part in the superficial mechanics (pots and pans rattle, glass shatters, powerful forces knock people to the floor), and to Mr. Raimi's credit, there is no happy ending. Still, the first rule in spook films is ""If you want to hold the audience's attention, make them believe the horror could really happen""-a rule Drag Me to Hell ignores at its"
250,RPT_Doc10_dragmetohell,RPT_Doc10_dragmetohell,RPT,Horror,Negative,Drag me to hell,"The title ""Drag Me to Hell"" offers both literal and ironic inklings to those associated with the movie's payoff, including the audience. A young woman aspiring for big professional opportunities at a bank makes a grievous error with a mysterious woman who arrives at her desk pleading for help, resulting in a horrific curse that anchors the crosshairs of torment onto her soul for a resulting 100 minutes of loud and foreboding celluloid. Her house thumps with the thundering sounds of something monstrous, and then a shadowy form tosses her around like a torn rag doll. She is attacked in her office garage. Animals hiss and growl as she walks by. She is assailed by visions of a malevolent being who makes clear his purpose of pulling her into an afterlife of endless torture and suffering. And then the movie demands the panic-stricken victim to sacrifice a kitten in a vain attempt to ward off the evil presence... and in that moment, a deplorable line is crossed. For the remaining running time, no more is it our concern as to whether she is going to emerge from the experience in tact or unscathed; the real hell eluded to by said title now becomes the movie theater, where moviegoers go from being surprised and thrilled to completely appalled by some contemptible plot decisions. After a certain point, the movie becomes our own cinematic damnation from which there is no escape. The movie is the brain child of Sam Raimi, who was made famous in this genre early on with the ""Evil Dead"" series, and then departed the trenches of B-movie horror comedy in favor of loftier Hollywood ambitions. The results were eclectic but effective, yielding the marvelous ""A Simple Plan,"" a taut thriller called ""The Gift,"" and the box office triumph of the first three ""Spider Man"" movies. Somehow, after those achievements, Raimi's mind convinced itself that revisiting the past was a wise decision, perhaps strengthened by the noting that more money for a film budget was as his disposal, and the support of a major studio would give him certain freedoms with this approach that were not allotted to him so many years prior. Sometimes, they say, the past is better left there. The movie stars Alison Lohman as Christine Brown, the would-be heroin of the story, who is basically a collection of insecurities masquerading around under the veneer of opportunistic intentions. She is a financial consultant at a bank, vying for an assistant manager position and doing nearly anything possible to try and impress her indecisive boss, who is also considering a potentially more qualified candidate for the job. Those lofty ambitions are realized when an old and grotesque woman (Lorna Raver) comes to her desk, begging for a third extension on her house's mortgage. Christine feigns sympathy, but denies the claim and leaves her at the mercy of a foreclosure. The old woman begins causing a public scene by getting on her knees, to which Christine calls security"
251,NKP_Doc1_Fresh,NKP_Doc1_Fresh,NKP,Horror,Negative,Fresh,"For a story about the horrors of being a woman and navigating the dating industrial complex, Fresh falls some way short of its title's promise. The creepiest moments in Mimi Cave's thriller Fresh are rooted in the familiar. These moments are creepier not in spite of their everyday banality, but because of it. Daisy Edgar-Jones plays a young woman navigating the dystopia that is modern dating. Like any young woman, she has become used to the idea that the onus is on her to stay on guard. Walking alone in a dark alleyway, she keeps her car key in a ready-to-jab position when she thinks she is being followed. A guy on a dating app responds to her comment on his cute cat pic with an unsolicited dick pic. The panic is writ large on her face when she can't get any bars on her phone. If women are terrified of walking home alone at night or losing cell phone reception, it is due to the sinister forces that lurk in the darkness. The forces don't get more sinister than in Cave's debut feature, which stirs up a batch of stew from the leftovers of American Psycho and You and calls it Fresh. Marinating the film is a touch of her own creative sadism. The gristle is its conceit of how women are commodified. As the film marches on, some succumb to the commodification, one joins in, and the rest figure out a way to overcome it - and survive. Online dating isn't working out for Noa (Edgar-Jones). Just when she is about to resign herself to a life of quiet solitude, she runs into handsome plastic surgeon Steve (Sebastian Stan) at the supermarket. They flirt over cotton-candy grapes, he makes some excuse to get her number, they bond over dead parents on the first date, and soon he is whisking her off on a getaway. If there is a red flag, it's that he has no social media presence and can't be found on Google. Noa's best friend Mollie (Jonica T Gibbs) voices some concern, but Noa writes it off as Steve favouring the old-fashioned ways just as much as he does his Old Fashioneds. After a half-an-hour or so is when the opening credits pop up to reveal what we're watching is in fact a horror movie. The romance, like many of the beloved entries of the genre, was to wear down the woman's defences till she gave in. Steve was playing a long con - and not for the first time, as Noa soon realises. A whole network of rich, powerful men (let's call them the patriarchy) depend on him to cater to their very particular appetite. To go into any more detail will only ruin the movie. Despite the swerves, there is little doubt over how the story will pan out, or the ostensible catharsis of its inevitable conclusion. When he calmly reveals Noa of her fate and loses his temper over her reaction, we witness"
252,NKP_Doc2_Fresh,NKP_Doc2_Fresh,NKP,Horror,Negative,Fresh,"Noa, lead character of the new film Fresh, has a problem. The single urban woman (Daisy Edgar-Jones) is understandably bored with her social life. Her current boyfriend is only interested in two conversational topics: his diet and a running critique of Noa's choice of wardrobe. Ugh. On top of that, whenever she ventures forth alone after dark from her tastefully decorated loft, Noa is-again, understandably-fearful of every approaching shape. Her best friend Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs) is worried about Noa's situation as well, especially after her friend's complaint that ""I always end up alone."" And so, when Noa gets approached in the supermarket produce section by a decent-looking, fairly articulate guy who, as he explains, is a doctor, we're not terribly surprised that suddenly she starts wearing that ""windfall jackpot"" expression on her face. Steve-the-new-guy (Sebastian Stan) talks the talk; he specializes in ""reconstructive surgery,"" walks the walk and lives in expensive surroundings-shot in Vancouver, B.C. What's more, Steve informs Noa that, ""I don't eat animals."" First-date sex is an easy step from there. We pause in our basic-synopsis due-diligence to note that neither Noa nor Steve sports the usual glib trappings of ostentatiously well-educated, upscale urbanity. That is, neither of them would automatically qualify as a Noah Baumbach character. Nor especially as, say, a Lisa Cholodenko creation, nor anyone from the Sofia Coppola or the Paul Thomas Anderson Licorice Pizza playbook. As Noa puts it: ""I hate, like, dating."" No media-savvy or literary traits here. The concept of irony is a vague stranger to the conversation. We do notice some squirm-worthy things about Steve that Noa seems to overlook. His lack of backstory, no wi-fi in his lavish home and-here's the kicker-he does not have an Instagram account. What kind of person is that? He generally seems wary of giving away too much info about himself. Uh-oh. Also, there are things Noa couldn't possibly see, things that appear to us onscreen: lots of close-ups of chewing mouths, in fact too many close-ups of body parts in general. Watch out, Noa. At this point, about halfway through former music-video-maker Mimi Cave's debut as a feature-film director-screenplay by girls-gone-wild specialist Lauryn Kahn (Ibiza)-we're finally starting to get down to the nut-formula of confused-consumer Noa's predicament. Warning: Those who want to be surprised by an obvious plot development should stop reading immediately. Mad doctor/sicko ""gourmet"" lures, imprisons and then butchers young women, in order to sell their meat to fellow rich-sicko clients, for high prices. We don't often think of Searchlight or Disney in terms of cheapo horror-as for the Sundance Film Festival, no surprise, they'll always take a chance. In Fresh the filmmakers don't appear especially interested in showing any character traits beyond the obvious with Noa and Steve. Only people who are dating talk like this to each other. She's conveniently shallow and passive; he's a garden-variety loathsome date-rape-type cheater unafraid to act out his horrible fantasies and turn a profit on them. Apart from a few brief scenes in"
253,NKP_Doc3_Fresh,NKP_Doc3_Fresh,NKP,Horror,Negative,Fresh,"The central idea of Fresh is either a blunt metaphor that gets in the way of the movie's actual point or the foundation of a sincere, creepy thriller that oversteps its significance. Either way, the movie comes across as a mishmash of tones, approaches, and purposes. It starts with relative innocence, as we watch Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) try to look for a good-or, at least, not-entirely-terrible-man in the world of online dating. Her most recent date is with a self-absorbed guy (played by Brett Dier) who's late for their dinner outing, isn't interested in a thing she has to say, displays more than a hint of racism while talking to the server, and, even though he made certain Noa knew they'd be splitting the bill, takes all of the leftovers for himself. The final notes of the evening have him suggesting they go out again, her saying they don't seem too compatible, and him responding with increasingly aggressive insults. Yes, this is how things have been going for Noa, and there's an amusing but unpleasant honesty to how screenwriter Lauryn Kahn sums up the despair, harassment, and quiet fear of the modern-day dating scene for women in these introductory scenes. While Noa can receive some constant sympathy and support from her best friend Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs), the young woman does want a romantic relationship. Enter Steve (Sebastian Stan). They meet at a grocery store, and he's charming but awkward, handsome but funny, and assertive but with a seemingly genuine sense of embarrassment about asking for her phone number. Noa is intrigued, and then, she can't stop thinking about him. When he texts her to ask her out for drinks, Noa accepts. There's barely a hint of what's to come in the scenes of grounded, whirlwind romance that follow. The two talk with some humor, self-awareness, and sincerity about their pasts and current lives, and Steve seems to be, not only a not-entirely-terrible guy, but also a good and kind and thoughtful one, who also happens to make good money as a reconstructive surgeon. Noa falls quickly and hard, and while Mollie's suspicions about someone who seems this too-good-to-be-true definitely strike us as a bit of foreshadowing, Noa doesn't seem to care. She and Steve are going to take a trip together, although the destination is a surprise and, whoops, they'll have leave the next day after a stay at his house, which happens to be in the middle of the woods without any cellphone service. There it is. All of that is simply a prologue-and a seemingly unessential one, given how far removed any sense of normalcy is from the proceeding material-for what's to come. To detail what follows the major twist of the plot and the story's intentions might undermine the surprise, but then again, it becomes clear that Kahn and director Mimi Cave are mostly out to continually shock us. It all begins as a straightforward abduction thriller, in which Noa is imprisoned and must find a"
254,NKP_Doc4_Fresh,NKP_Doc4_Fresh,NKP,Horror,Negative,Fresh,"Fresh plays out like director Mimi Cave (primarily known for shorts and music videos, making her feature-length debut) and screenwriter Lauryn Kahn (also experienced with shorts, although with a feature-length script already to her name) are ready to burn down the entire enterprise of online dating. To be fair, given stranger than fiction documentaries like The Tinder Swindler readily available on Netflix and no doubt a plethora of negative personal experiences to pull from, there's also nothing wrong with taking that system down a peg, especially when it comes to the swaths of undesirable men outnumbering women on the various social applications. That part is well-intentioned. However, Fresh gets so far stuck up its ass that a final punchline zinger comes across like victim shaming. It seems to be saying that this abusive situation would have never developed had the heroine decided to go on another date with an unmannered, offputting douche. One could also go a step further and take it as saying straight hopeful romantic women clinging onto the prospect of finding something sincere and wonderful and meaningful should give up because heterosexual dating is only a bunch of Chads, which is the gross date character's name because that's how unsubtle the jokes are here. More to the point, fuck that; I have my own unflattering stories of using online dating services, but I've also gotten to know some incredible people there I still regularly talk to. Let's meet the movie halfway; my personal feelings offset whatever the filmmakers are serving up. Fresh is amateurishly written, filled with convenient writing, plot inconsistencies, illogical character motivations, and most offensively, considering this is first and foremost a social commentary horror movie, rarely elicits dread. This is explored through cannibalism (there is also no point beating around the bush, considering the advertising is heavily selling Fresh this way). Daisy Edgar-Jones' Noa takes a break from online dating to pursue a grocery aisle meet-cute with awkwardly charming and handsome plastic surgeon Steve (Sebastian Stan). So maybe the regressive message is also not to take a chance on attractive people? Anyway, Fresh does take its time building a believable connection between these two while using Noa's desire for romance as a crutch for letting her guard down and making some unwise decisions that her friend Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs, saddled with a disappointing nothing role of a cautiously supportive Black friend that attempts to save the day when shit goes south) advises against. Nevertheless, for the most part, the honeymoon phase between Noa and Steve is used smartly, crescendoing with a black comedy title card drop signifying the end of act one and the descent into sadistic danger. There is no denying that Steve has some twisted motives. That also doesn't mean Fresh follows through on any of it, evoking tension or terror. If anything, the proceedings become borderline comical and absurd; the flesh is removed (and in some cases, limbs), but characters remain largely functional and alert. At one point, a character"
255,NKP_Doc5_Fresh,NKP_Doc5_Fresh,NKP,Horror,Negative,Fresh,"Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) is a single woman trying to make it out there in a world where dating apps lead to uncomfortable dinners with gross, openly sexist man-children. Imagine her surprise when she has a grocery store meet-cute with the 'just awkward enough to be charming but not so awkward he's off-putting' Steve (Sebastian Stan). As you might guess, the two quickly hit it off, and soon enough Steve's whisking Noa away on a weekend vacation - but first they have to spend the night at Steve's place, which it turns out is deep, deep, deep in the woods, isolated from civilization and without any cell service. Looks like Noa's in some trouble. Cue the opening credits.The fact that the opening titles don't drop until thirty minutes into Mimi Cave's gender politics thriller FRESH is unfortunately the most inventive thing on the menu for this reductive, skin-deep examination of subject matter that deserves far more dimensionality than what Lauryn Kahn's script has to offer. From the opening act, the film reeks of well past their expiration date cliches regarding toxic men in our modern dating culture and the ways they commodify women to be conquests rather than people. The trouble is that FRESH doesn't treat any of its characters as more than commodities either. As Steve's eventual trapping and torture of Noa ensues, one begs to wonder how much more investment the audience may have in this leading lady if we were given any sense of who she actually was beyond ""woman in peril"". FRESH skipped that part, though, choosing instead to simply pin this as a generic Bad Man vs. Good Woman showdown without any attempt at nuance or opening up any (ahem) fresh conversation on topics that are ripe for far deeper examination than what we get here. FRESH is all frills, no substance, taking its central metaphor of ""men see women as meat, right?"" and playing it to the rafters (over and over again...), but there simply isn't anything else there beyond this mere surface observation that has been mined for more fruitful gains plenty of times by smarter films that put in more effort than this. Cave and Kahn's approach is reminiscent to Promising Young Woman in the way that it doesn't feel like it's really contributing much to the conversation, despite it playing itself as if it's saying something revelatory or particularly incisive. Perhaps that wouldn't be quite so damning if the characters were given any dimensionality to them, but they aren't. An overlong two hours spent with these two characters, and the even worse handled periphery characters, and there's still nothing known about any of them beyond being cogs in this film's machine. They could have been anyone, especially the female characters. More time given to the first act, or more thoughtful observations on the characters in this section at the very least, would have gone a long way.

256,NKP_Doc6_Fresh,NKP_Doc6_Fresh,NKP,Horror,Positive,Fresh,"The opening credits of Fresh don't arrive until the 33-minute mark. That's appropriate because the first half-hour feels like a short film in its own right. It tells the story of a woman and man meeting, falling for each other, and prepping to take their first getaway as a couple. Thirty-three minutes in is precisely when the story shifts, shedding the romantic-comedy vibe it starts off with and clueing us in that something sinister is about to happen. Subversion of this sort is pervasive in the movie. In fact, it's the most admirable of many admirable qualities. I'm not going to tell you anything that happens after the extended intro. Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) is a perpetually unlucky-in-love single woman. We first meet her on a blind date from hell, where the guy turns into a misogynist prick as soon as she refuses to kiss him goodnight. Soon after, she has an encounter with plastic surgeon Steve (Sebastian Stan) in a grocery store. They flirt, she gives him her number, they hook up, etc. Noa's best friend Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs) thinks Steve sounds suspicious. He's got no Instagram account, after all! Noa nevertheless agrees to go on a weekend trip with her new boyfriend. First, though, they have to swing by his place, a large home out in the middle of nowhere. What happens next is shocking, gross, and very, very bad for Noa. The twist may be off-putting for some viewers, but don't bail. Fresh is one of the most smartly-written horror films of the last decade, and what happens - while intentionally repellant - is handled with a flair for astute psychological details. You can already surmise that Steve is not a good guy. What he does and why he does it prove to be more substantive than we often see in horror, speaking to the idea of one's soul being susceptible to the corrupting influence of ego. Noa, meanwhile, quickly comes to realize that she can't merely jump out a window. To escape, she'll need to read Steve like a book, figuring out a non-sexual way to seduce him and, consequently, make him vulnerable. Doing that forces her to go to uncomfortable places. Lauryn Kahn's superb screenplay gets those ideas across intelligently, mixing them with thrilling twists you don't anticipate. As well written as it is, Fresh requires pitch-perfect performances to fully succeed, and it's got them. Daisy Edgar-Jones exquisitely conveys how Noa sheds her timidity in the situation, channeling her fear into a desire to outsmart Steve at all costs. The actress never once overplays it, allowing us to develop a sincere rooting interest in what happens to the character. Sebastian Stan matches her beat-for-beat with a very different kind of role. He makes Steve unhinged, yet in a way that feels credible. Instead of a generic villain, the movie gives us one with more than a semblance of humanity - a fact that serves to make him even scarier.

257,NKP_Doc7_Fresh,NKP_Doc7_Fresh,NKP,Horror,Positive,Fresh,"Mimi Cave's debut feature Fresh sits in a tricky sort of niche where part of its appeal is the unexpected direction its story takes, but where discussion of that direction will inevitably give away some of its secrets. Even by mentioning this shift the damage has partly been done, since readers will now be aware that the film is not quite what it originally purports to be. It is the price we all have to pay, I suppose, since I think it would be irresponsible to let people start the film confidently expecting a romantic comedy and suddenly finding themselves watching a deeply queasy horror film instead. If I have spoiled things for you, I apologise, but trust that if you finish reading at the end of the next sentence I have spoiled far less that Fresh's own promotion and advertising has. It's a great little film, and you should endeavour to give it a shot. Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) is sick of the dating scene: the awkward dinners, swiping left and right on dating apps, and particularly the unsolicited 'dick pics'. A chance encounter in a supermarket introduces her to Steve (Sebastian Stan), a charismatic doctor that seems just the antidote to her dating blues. The first half hour of Fresh really does feel like an energised and knowing reset of the romantic comedy. It boasts a tremendous female perspective on male behaviour - both in person and online - and very effectively showcases the challenges women face on a seemingly daily basis. It spikes the stereotypes, and allows a fresh sort of cheerful cynicism to keep it light but relevant. There is a warmth to the characters that makes it a very easy watch. Then it starts to instinctively feel wrong, and untrustworthy. Alarm bells sound in the mind as mixed behaviours build a growing sense of paranoia. By the time it is obvious that Noa is in trouble it is too late to escape, and Fresh slides into an entirely new vibe. Fresh is stylishly produced, with a rich aesthetic that deliberately straddles the line between luxurious and nauseating. This sickly-sweet environment plays host to two excellent lead performances from Edgar-Jones and Stan. They embrace the film's often absurd developments, and go a long way in convincing the audience to accept a fairly unlikely situation. There is strong supporting work here too: chiefly from Dayo Okeniyi as the amusing bartender Paul and particularly Jonica T. Gibbs as Noa's enterprising best friend Millie. It isn't perfect. For one thing the third act rather feels like Cave and screenwriter Lauryn Kahn gave up on juggling all of the narrative balls and simply threw them in the air and ran away. This is particularly true when it comes to the character of Ann (Charlotte Le Bon), whose role in the narrative is set up with intrigue but abandoned in a panic. The film's overarching themes also feel very slightly underdeveloped. Then there is the problem of violence: the jump between genres"
258,NKP_Doc8_Fresh,NKP_Doc8_Fresh,NKP,Horror,Positive,Fresh,"There will likely never be a time when romance and relationships aren't explored in cinema, and the 2022 edition of the Sundance Film Festival is certainly demonstrative of this idea. While the following two films are vastly different form one another, both are astute studies of how we view relationships in the 21st century. Mimi Cave's Fresh is set to shake up the world when it gets its eventual release into the mainstream, whereas Joachim Trier's The Worst Person in the World has already taken the world by storm during its very illustrious 2021 festival run. Both films are demanding of one's attention. Dating in 2022 can be a scary thing, and with Fresh, Mimi Cave has crafted a creatively charged thrill ride that is equal parts romantic and horrifying. As a directorial debut, Cave makes an astounding entrance with articulate poise and confidence in her creative choices. The film tells a gripping story that has just the right inflections of humour, while never flinching away from taking aggressive swings that are blissfully imaginative. Daisy Edgar-Jones and Sebastian Stan deliver performances that are on par with the film's inherent intensity, resulting in one of the most engrossing narratives at the festival this year. Like many of her contemporaries, Noa (Edgar-Jones) spends her days swiping through matches on dating apps, only to find herself strung into one charmless date after another. During this stretch of unceremonious matches, she meets Steve (Stan), who woes her after a seemingly random encounter in a supermarket. Thinking that she has met the right guy, in the traditional manner, Noa convinces herself that things are going great with this mysterious and charismatic being. That is, until things aren't so great anymore. Fresh also boasts a strong supporting cast that includes Andrea Bang, Jojo T. Gibbs, Dayo Okeniyi and Charlotte Le Bon. And with a film like this, the less one knows, the better. But let's just say that this is far from your typical modern day dating story. And with a rather intriguing premise, Cave sets the tone perfectly in creating an ambiance that is capable of being extremely flexible. Bouncing between moments of comedic jabs to stretches of terrifying tension, Fresh adapts like water, taking on the right form in the most fluid of motions. And no matter where the narrative ends up going, there's a sense of romance that always seems to linger in the background. This sense of romance isn't necessarily reflective of a loving relationship, but still rings true of the sensual force shared between two people. And that force, as we all know, isn't always a positive one. In fact, the film makes an impactful statement on how women are often treated as commodities by men, and demonstrates this with superb instinctual creativity. Cave might be going for an extreme take here, but through her assured stylistic choices, a thoughtful worldview is presented in an overly affecting way. Her use of framing, Alex Somers' searing score and Pawel Pogorzelski's sharp, yet"

After a chance encounter with Steve (Sebastian Stan), an attractive man at the grocery store, Noa decides to do the unthinkable and gives her number to a man she's just met in the wild. The two form an instant connection and Noa continues her impulsive streak and joins Steve for a weekend away. It's at this point that things go awry, and also when the title credits roll in (almost 30 minutes into the film!) That FRESH is Cave's first feature film is extraordinary. She's incredibly bold in her camera work and styling, clearly influenced by the '70s and '80s. Cave uses the camera in a number of ways, but perhaps the most interesting is when it captures the POV of a character. She uses her lens to take the audience along for the ride. Stan, in particular, is a stand out in FRESH. Incredibly charming and deliciously cheeky, he's a delectable delight as Steve- albeit a bit sinister. Likewise, Edgar-Jones makes Noa incredibly relatable, especially given how familiar her character's journey is to anyone who has ever attempted to find a partner through an app. It's hard to talk about the film without giving the game away. It's an engrossing story that's surprises but doesn't rely on its shock value alone. There are moments of dark humour and genuinely gripping moments too. As a horror/thriller it works well, and as a dark comedy, it works well too. What has stayed with me most about FRESH is how real it felt. Not the circumstances Noa finds herself in with Steve, of course. But that feeling of utter helplessness, that sinking feeling in your stomach when you know something's wrong, and the anticipation that something bad is about to happen. To some this may be commentary on gender politics, but to me, it's a director simply re-creating a scenario most women have thought of at one point or another: what if he kidnaps or hurts me? There's a reason we text each other details of our dates (name, picture, location of date, etc.) beforehand and send reassuring messages when we've arrived home safely. The root causes of this kind of behaviour are complicated, but in those moments we're not thinking about that. We do those things to keep us safe. And while it may seem ludicrous to think we might get kidnapped or hurt, it does happens every day. Cave takes all of these fears, safety precautions, and paranoias and imagines a heightened scenario - a scenario of what if all our worst fears about online dating came true. FRESH is an enjoyably dark romp with some great performances. But there is one glaring issue that needs to be addressed: the Black best friend, Mollie (Jojo T. Gibbs). It's 2022"
260,NKP_Doc10_Fresh,NKP_Doc10_Fresh,NKP,Horror,Positive,Fresh,"Fresh is a nearly two-hour movie that doesn't let you in on its secret for almost a quarter of that time. It starts all quirky and nice with a young woman named Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) navigating the world of modern dating. She's on all the apps, meets guys who are real assholes, some of them send her unsolicited dick pics, it's not looking good. Then, just out at a store, she meets Steve (Sebastian Stan). Steve is funny, kind, and smart, and after a few dates he invites her to go on a trip. There are some red flags, but how bad could he really be? ""Worse than you can even imagine"" is the answer to that question. And that's when Fresh gets really, really, really fucked up. In delaying the truth of Fresh, director Mimi Cave does her best to put the audience in Noa's shoes. She wants us to trust Steve. We want to trust Steve. We're all team Noa. If Noa and Steve work out, it's a proof that storybook romance is still possible in this dark, messed up world. All of which makes the film's horrific reveal that much more shocking and impactful when it comes. It's such a big shift, in fact, that if you aren't prepared for it, it might be too much for you. I won't spoil it, though you'd probably guess if you had three chances. Let's just say that Fresh is not a romance. It's a full on horror film and a gory one at that. It shares more in common with Eli Roth's Hostel than almost any other film we can think of, though there are elements of Get Out, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and The Silence of the Lambs throughout. But the script by Lauryn Kahn uses all of those tropes to their advantage, playing with expectations and building anticipation. Some of it pays off as you'd expect, many things do not, but all of it adds up to scare us into believing this shocking story of a woman's worst dating nightmare could be true. At times it can be a little over the top, but Fresh is a film that is always pushing for maximum reaction, and it never compromises. Much of that is because of the performances by Edgar-Jones and Stan. Stan we all know. He's Bucky Barnes. The Winter Soldier. But that stoic mystery he brings to Marvel goes out the door in Fresh, revealing a psychopathic glee that's both disarming and delightfully disgusting. Edgar-Jones, a relative newcomer, makes Noa into the girl anyone would love to be friends with. Loyal, strong, clever, all things that we see Steve falling for and which, ultimately, might be her way out of a very horrible situation. Together, the two of them have electric chemistry that tiptoes between disturbing and delightful, adding tension and intrigue to every encounter. Led by those two strong performances, a very tight script by Kahn, and Cave's dynamic direction, Fresh is horror done"
261,AVA_Doc1_MinorityReport,AVA_Doc1_MinorityReport,AVA,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority Report,"Minority Report, Steven Spielberg's enjoyable new thriller set in Washington, D.C., in 2054-full of more alluring gadgets than you can shake a stick at-performs its own bubble dance, for good and ill. Derived from a Philip K. Dick story that's more about action than nuanced commentary, it doesn't have a vision that incorporates a poetics but functions as a grand entertainment; part of its central plan is to always give you more to look at than you can possibly take in. Some of my colleagues have been calling it a thinking person's action movie, but the drive of its narrative and the heft of its visuals don't give you much time to think-basically you're reduced to gawking and following.Minority Report does offer a few issues to ponder, and given the mindlessness of most summer action specials, it's something of an intellectual feast, even if it's all hors d'oeuvres. Yet alongside last summer's A.I., which had the benefit of Stanley Kubrick's intellect, Minority Report has mainly the illusion of thought. (To Spielberg's credit, both as a filmmaker and as a thinker, he noted recently that when he saw the kind of hostile reviews A.I. was getting, he realized he must have done something right-because all of Kubrick's own pictures since 2001: A Space Odyssey got the same sort of critical response.) At the very least, Minority Report is crammed with details that are not so much ideas as the seeds (or sometimes the pits) of ideas. Like me, Spielberg grew up on Mad when it was still a comic book, and the hallmark of its 50s pictorial style, which he was already emulating two decades ago in 1941, is to stuff wisecracks into the edges of the frames; here he does the same thing with modules of future-think furnished by a team of experts he and his staff organized. Yet some of these modules work less as ideas than as mechanisms designed to shove us forward; the (minority report) itself, which figured significantly in the Dick story, functions here mainly as one more red herring. Sustained thought is discouraged here by the characters, situations, and premises-however serviceable they are in other respects. Let's start with the last of these: the notion of a (precrime) police bureau that predicts future murders in order to abort them. The most alluring thing about this notion is said to be the way it anticipates today's headlines-the post-September 11 strategy whereby we give up some of our freedom and privacy in exchange for an assurance that future disasters will be averted. Since no such assurance can be given honestly, the value of losing some of our freedom and privacy remains to be demonstrated (at least to the American public, if not to those who've contrived to take these things away from us). The pitch behind such an exchange is actually a simplistic formula designed to give only the impression of thought. This isn't to say that Minority Report espouses having a special bureau to predict crimes"
262,AVA_Doc2_MinorityReport,AVA_Doc2_MinorityReport,AVA,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority Report,"Steven Spielberg's Minority Report realizes the full potential of author Philip K. Dick's science-fiction worldview, a perspective filled with dangerous technology, feverish paranoia, and metaphysical philosophies. Spielberg's complicated, wonderfully stylized approach uses Dick's 1956 short story of the same name as a launching pad. While it captures the author's vision of an imperfect future and the perilous reality that dwells under the alluring surface of futurism, the picture also stands as Spielberg's most extraordinary exhibit of pure filmmaking. Minority Report augments and expands on the source material, concentrating Dick's obsessions about the potential dangers of technology and the author's ongoing existential battle between free will and determinism, especially in regard to the manipulation of time, such as time travel or precognition. Over more than forty novels and several short story collections, Dick's work permeates a sense of fascination and suspicion toward the future. The fascinating prospect of new technologies, exploration of new frontiers, and humanity's evolutionary progression of extra-sensory perceptions consume his output. And yet, he always investigates their inevitable downfalls. His stories feature characters hindered by supposed advancements, thrown into the central conflict by a set of circumstances put into motion by unsound developments. In that tradition, Spielberg's film is a nonstop chase, at once a thriller of epic escapist and intellectual bravado. It amalgamates Hitchcockian suspense, elements of film noir, and Dick's vision of the future, three of the most distinctive and inventive of all storytelling styles, into a single source, resulting in a masterful triumph from a masterful filmmaker. Set in the near-future, Minority Report introduces the concept of Precrime, Washington D.C.'s exploration into a revolutionary form of law enforcement. Founded by Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow) and headed by Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise), Precrime utilizes the (gifts) of the Precogs, three clairvoyants who have given up their freedom to support the cause of detecting crimes before they occur. The Precogs' foreseen visions are analyzed by the Precrime unit and verified by a council of judges; a positive mark is identified, and suddenly officers race to prevent a crime from taking place. Impending perpetrators are caught and then booked before ever committing an offense. When the film opens, there hasn't been a murder in the District of Columbia for six years; the existence of Precrime alone virtually eliminates the consideration of murder, so only crimes of passion remain. Though dedicated to the ideology of Precrime, Anderton's personal life is in shambles. Long ago, his young son disappeared at a public pool; now a divorce, he whiffs neural drugs to escape the guilt and painful memories of his former life. On the job, however, he remains professional and composed. In the opening scenes, Justice Department representative Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) enters the Precrime offices to audit the program for national expansion and meets Anderton, who jealously protects the system he helped build. Witwer's insistence that a human component will ultimately threaten the countrywide growth of Precrime quickly proves true after the Precogs predict that Anderton will commit"
263,AVA_Doc3_MinorityReport,AVA_Doc3_MinorityReport,AVA,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority Report,"This film marks the first collaboration between Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise. The film has audiences asking some important questions. What if we knew what was going to happen in the future? After you ask yourself the question, what if the person knowing this found out he was going to kill someone? This is the gist of the film, which is based on the Philip K. Dick short story. Another thing here is that the audience must be able to buy into the science early on in the film. This is key to being able to just sit back and enjoy the ride. If you're watching the film for the first time in 2020, the science is very believable. It's amazing how much of the science is catching up right in front of us. There's something to be said about the eye-dentification. Social media platforms already know our faces. Companies target us online because of internet cookies. One could look at author Philip K. Dick as a prophet in the world of science-fiction. In case you didn't know, Dick is also the man behind Blade Runner. One of the film's main themes is free will vs. determinism. The film handles this so beautifully. If we know our future, could we possibly do something to change it? The Department of PreCrime, at least in what we see on screen, is mostly focusing on preventing murders. This is where the three pre-cognitives are the main focus. Two twin males and one female share a common trait. They see the future and the visions appear on a giant screen. Together, they're able to see the future. They have no interaction with the outside world. The department's agents work to arrest people on the basis of the visions. PreCrime Captain John Anderton (Tom Cruise) has turned to drugs since his son, Sean, disappeared. Anderton is also separated from his wife, Lara (Kathryn Morris). Anderton just happens to have the unfortunate luck of being in the pre-cogs vision when DOJ agent Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is visiting the agency. Talk about bad luck! Anderton now goes on the run and PreCrime creator Dr. Iris Hineman (Lois Smith) tells him that Agatha (Samantha Morton) sometimes has a different vision. Dr. Hineman refers to this as a (minority report.) There's a lot of mystery in the film surrounding the death of Ann Lively (Jessica Harper). She just happens to be Agatha's mother. The further we get into the film, Anderton learns that he's being framed. Meanwhile, Witwer starts studying the available footage and starts to believe the same. Anybody in the right mind would do what he does next. But what Witwer doesn't know is that the director and founder of PreCrime, Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow), is covering up the murder. Goodbye Witwer! In many aspects, Minority Report falls under the usual sci-fi playground. But more than this, the action thriller also ventures into film noir territory. We can also see this in the film's color"
264,AVA_Doc4_MinorityReport,AVA_Doc4_MinorityReport,AVA,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority Report,"In the year 2054, at the Department of Precrime in Washington, D.C., Case 1108 is assigned to Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise). It's a murder charge in which the deed has yet to be committed. Due to the discovery of the Precogs, three humans with the special ability to predict unlawful activities approximately four days in advance of their occurrences, the crime rate has dropped by over 90% in the area. Anderton specializes in (red ball) situations (designated by an elaborate computer system synced to the Precogs brains that spits out colored wooden orbs), such as 1108, which are crimes of passion - since there's no premeditation, these murders can only be seen a few hours or minutes prior to the event. This new scheme is the ultimate invasion of privacy - and it's on the verge of sweeping the nation. Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is sent from the Attorney General of the United States to determine if there are any flaws in the system before the program spreads to other districts. Since humans run it, there will be inevitable glitches. The first problem occurs when John digs around the archives looking for a specific murder case in which the killer was apprehended but never identified. Each case is supposed to have three previsions, one from each Precog - the most powerful auger being the catatonic Agatha (Samantha Morton). But several of Agatha's files are missing. The following day, the divine trio have another visual prophecy - one in which Anderton himself is the murderer. In the future, automated eye scan devices identify everyone so that movements across the city cannot occur without government knowledge. It's a scarily authoritarian arrangement designed to demonstrate the oppression and faults of a Big Brother world. And it's just a piece of a rather impressive conceptualization of the dictatorial, slave-to-technology years to come, mixed with darker, noirish elements of grime and shadows (like an updated (Blade Runner) setting). Other visual accessories and indications of scientific advancements include an innovative, computerized workspace (in which files float across translucent screens - an idea frequently spoofed and copied), high-speed cars that move up and down skyscrapers, three-dimensional memory files, and rickety jetpacks. Additionally, Paul Verhoeven-styled, commercial-like news updates and invasive media is blasted through enormous monitors stationed throughout the city. As an action picture more predominantly than a thinking man's piece, the stunts and chases are nicely choreographed, further embellished with fitting music by John Williams. It's a light-hearted type of violent adventure along the lines of a futuristic Indiana Jones (or any of Schwarzenegger's sci-fi works), with cleverer escapes and showdowns, and subtle humor fused into the combat. The level of fantasy frequently rivals the severer science-fiction elements, radiating Spielberg's brand of lively storytelling. The blue-and-black, muted, desaturated cinematography sharply aids the tone of (Minority Report,) which, for a Philip K. Dick adaptation, possesses quite the focus on thrills and destruction over satire and criticism. And indeed, while the story is superbly complex, twisting and turning"
265,AVA_Doc5_MinorityReport,AVA_Doc5_MinorityReport,AVA,Sci-Fi,Positive,Minority Report,"Steven Spielberg's 2002 treatment of author Philip K. Dick's dystopian short story is a visually arresting murder mystery as prophetic about the obliteration of personal privacy as the story's (precog) characters are at predicting murders before they occur. For the film's neo-noir look Spielberg employed a bleach bypass process to create a washed-out monochromatic appearance. The method has since been repeatedly copied as a kneejerk visual style for many other film genres. The year is 2054 in Washington D.C., where murder has been eliminated for the past six years thanks to a Justice Department program called ""PreCrime."" Think Patriot Act. In a high-security government facility, three carefully guarded psychic humans - called precogs - prophesize murders from their semi-conscious states. Agatha (Samantha Morton) is the female precog endowed with the strongest sense of foresight. Floating in a saline pool, the trio's brains are wired to computers, thus allowing the PreCrime unit - lead by Captain Jon Anderton (Tom Cruise) - to apprehend murderers seconds before they commit their would-be crime. Since the film's release, of course, the American government has initiated preemptive wars, arrests of terror ""plotters"" who never got past the talking stage of their future crimes, and drone strikes that make a (PreCrime)-styled approach to domestic law enforcement seem prescient. Anderton joined the program after the disappearance of his young son tore apart his marriage. His emotional Achilles' heel serves as an ideal tool for the powers that be to set him up as a poster-boy killer in order to obfuscate other illicit secrets. In a trope recognizable to fans of sci-fi movies like ""Logan's Run,"" precog-based evidence that Anderton will kill a victim within 36 hours sends him on the run from the same team of enforcement agents he once led. The (minority report) of the film's title refers to conflicting intelligence among the precogs regarding their hive-mind premonitions. If there is such a conflict in the precog's report on Anderton, it resides inside Agatha's mind. In order to infiltrate his former workplace and retrieve the potentially vindicating information from Agatha, Anderton undergoes a gruesome eye-transplant procedure performed by a doctor he formerly helped imprison. U.S. District Attorney detective Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is also hot on Anderton's trail, as part of an investigation into potential flaws in the PreCrime program. Spielberg borrows elements from films as diverse as (The Big Sleep) to (Don't Look Now) to (The Man Who Fell to Earth) to articulate his vision. The movie's combination of old and new influences energizes its believable futuristic elements. Targeted advertising follows citizens wherever they go - addressing them by name at each point of contact. A highly conceptual (maglev) system allows computer-controlled cars to travel vertically as well as horizontally. 3D holographic - anticipating today's Apple-created ""pinch screens"" - recordings of Anderton's son and ex-wife allow him to revisit his past during a melancholic episode that resists the film's otherwise noir aspects. Such thoughtfully designed features contribute to the film's success as a pioneering achievement"
266,AVA_Doc6_MinorityReport,AVA_Doc6_MinorityReport,AVA,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority Report,"In Minority Report, a futuristic thriller set in 2054, murder has been eliminated in Washington DC thanks to a division of law enforcement known as Precrime. Tapping into the minds of the Pre-Cogs, a trio of psychics who can foresee the future, Precrime is able to track down and arrest would-be killers before they actually commit their lethal deeds. The system appears to be flawless. But when police chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise), the head of this controversial department, is himself accused of the future murder of a man he hasn't even met, he sets out to prove his innocence, all the while hunted by his fellow officers. Based on a 1956 short story by renowned science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, Minority Report is typical of director Steven Spielberg in how it deftly melds flashy entertainment with critical issues. The movie is made up of three major ingredients: the thrilling action of an innocent man running from the law; the cautionary tale of how good intentions can go astray when not tempered by wisdom (specifically, infringing on people's civil liberties in the name of protecting them); and the old debate of human free will versus pre-ordained destiny. Unfortunately, the movie's philosophical elements take a backseat to John's mundane escape from authorities. Clearly, I understand that the relentless manhunt is more important than a bunch of metaphysical mumbo jumbo to most people. But without the pre-determined fate aspect, Minority Report is really nothing more than your standard crime drama, complete with cliches ranging from the generic framing of an innocent man to the corruption in the ranks of the police. I'm not asking for a stuffy dissertation that bores audiences like the sterile Solaris--just a comfortable balance that gives a little more substantial acknowledgement to the concept of being able to control one's own future. As it is, the film only briefly engages the notion of pre-determination intelligently when John debates Precrime issues with Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell), an agent from the Justice Department who has been ordered to find flaws in the system. John's argument of an absolute future is just about the most interesting and thought-provoking moment of the whole movie, although the scene quickly gives way to nonsense that stretches even the boundaries of science fiction (a claim that the Pre-Cogs can only foresee homicides because ""there's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another"" puts an arbitrary importance on human lives). Credibility is further shot when the story dissolves into trite cheerleading that all but says, ""You can do it! You control your destiny! Go, John!"" Cruise's frequent failure to convey emotion makes his character of John Anderton less than interesting. We see none of his conviction in the ideas of justice, none of his sense of betrayal when the system turns on him, and none of his paranoia in a suddenly hostile world. In an attempt to elicit sympathy and establish John's dedication"
267,AVA_Doc7_MinorityReport,AVA_Doc7_MinorityReport,AVA,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority Report,"I saw someone praising Minority Report on social media, and was reminded how much I hate it. So I thought I'd re-up this piece from my old blog. It's 11 years old, but still accurate. After watching Minority Report last night, I was surprised to discover that most critics do not consider it to be an utter and complete piece of crap. Roger Ebert, in particular, had an absolutely gushing review, in which he praised the film for being (a thriller and a human story, a movie of ideas that's also a whodunit.) Ebert is by all accounts a lovely human being, but every time I read something by him, I am reminded that he does not have the critical sense that God gave a roach. Even an insect that frolics in filth would be hard pressed to find any enjoyment in such a shiny, treacly, turkey of a film. Spielberg as director has found perhaps the perfect outlet for his glibness in this tale of precognitive saviors. The film grinds frictionlessly along, a remorselessly predictable blueprint for itself. Flawed hero, tragic backstory, clever chase scene, cleverer chase scene, cleverest chase scene, false antagonist, twist, real antagonist, reconciliation with perfectly domestic yet also spunky wife. Like the precogs, we can see it all coming and all going too; painful echoes of sentiment past sliding down our brainstems as we float weightlessly in an infinite vat of sentimental horseshit. The emotional core of the film is (you could predict it) the tragic backstory I mentioned. John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is a efficient no-nonsense police guy in the precrime unit, snooping out murders before they happen. Beneath his gruff exterior and Hollywood good looks, though, lurks a sadness; his 5-year old disappeared from a public pool. Anderton's marriage collapsed, and now he takes drugs (ooooh...dark) and watches 3-D home movies of his son and wife. His heart is tugged while watching them and our heart is tugged while watching him; it's a testament to the power of film and to (complex human feelings), in Ebert's words. Said complex human feelings being: hey, losing a kid - that really sucks. If that happens to you, you've got to be deep, right? That is the extent of the film's character development; Anderton has no other discernible personality traits; nor does his wife. The film's stupid, by-the-numbers plot, it's utterly facile and familiar characters, are all supposed to be redeemed by dropping a murdered five-year old onto them from a great height. Before I had a kid myself, I found this sort of mindless, self-serving manipulation unpleasant. Now that I have a child of my own, who is actually a person rather than a trope, I find it even more detestable. At the end of the film, Anderton indignantly yells at his stupid standard-issue corrupt boss for manipulating his love for his child. Rarely have I seen a moment of such utterly clueless hypocrisy. The whole film is nothing but a giant machine designed to"

Set in the year 2054 in Washington, D.C., Tom Cruise stars as John Anderton, who, having lost his son, now does his best to prevent murders before they happen as Chief of the elite Pre-Crime Division of the Justice Department. Assisting him are three genetically altered precognitives known as (Pre-Cogs) who are attached to machines that record their visions of murders which are (set) to occur anywhere from a few minutes to four days into the future. With each vision, two wooden balls roll out of the machine attachment, each one bearing the name of the killer and victim. As a result of this (perfect) system, Washington, D.C. is now murder free. (Let's face it, given our life and times, Dick should have set this scenario in 3054 to have any plausibility.) Believing the Pre-Cogs infallible, Anderton advocates nationalizing the Pre-Crime system, that is until the Justice Department questions the methods and techniques utilized by the Division and Anderton himself becomes the subject of a Pre-Cog vision seeing him committing a murder. Suddenly questioning the accuracy of the system (since he of course knows he's innocent and will continue to be innocent), Anderton goes on the run, stealing a female Pre-Cog named Agatha, setting us up for what now becomes a routine futuristic chase movie. Directed by Steven Spielberg, (Minority Report) reeks of the darker tone and color desaturation found in Spielberg's last futuristic foray, (A.I.), a technique that works well in this type of film and once again is executed beautifully by long time Spielberg cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. Hand in hand with Kaminski's artistic flair, are some dazzling special effects action sequences, including a chase on a vertical highway that is so impressive, you have to see it to believe it. (Warning - those with severe motion sickness may want to cover their eyes at this part.) Not to be outdone, many scenes which one would believe are special effects, are in fact, the result of elaborately and elegantly choreographed camera maneuvers which are expertly executed and utilized for maximum dramatic effect. Cruise performs admirably as Anderton, using physicality and controlled raw emotion to their best advantage as he manipulates not only his pursuers, but the audience as well. An excellent counterpoint to Cruise's energetic yet psychologically tormented Anderton is Samantha's Moore portrayal of Pre-Cog Agatha - tacit, ethereal and seemingly helpless. Max von Sydow, no stranger to the futuristic and fantastic ((Dune), (Judge Dredd) and (The Exorcist)) steps in as Anderton's superior, Bureau Director Burgess, exhibiting an almost fatherly pride in his protege Anderton while relative newcomer, Colin Farrell is perfectly cast as the bureaucratic FBI investigator Danny Witwer who"

It's not pretty. There are two Steven Spielbergs. One is the cinematic historian who instructs, informs and shapes a universal consciousness that makes us aware of our stake in the human race in masterpieces like Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan . The other is a 12-year-old comic-book collector weaned on sci-fi and stuck in the twilight zone of his own nursery, who turns out polished but moronic time-wasters about dinosaurs, space ships, Indiana Jones and Peter Pan. Quel doppelganger . I always have a hard time believing the same man capable of both greatness ( The Color Purple ) and trash ( Jurassic Park ). Occasionally, a film like E.T. or Raiders of the Lost Ark emerges to meld the technical proficiency of the craftsman with the passion of the storyteller. Bloody, violent, cold and preposterous, Minority Report is not one of them. Despite an astronomical budget and a gallimaufry of twists and turns enhanced by special effects, Minority Report has a boring, one-dimensional story line you could write on one page of Big Chief tablet paper with a No. 2 lead pencil. Derived from a story by sci-fi spinmaster Philip K. Dick (the man responsible for Blade Runner ), it's set in Washington, D.C., in 2054. Crime has been wiped out thanks to an experimental Pre-Crime Unit called a (priori,) developed by wacko scientist Max von Sydow, that can predict murders before they happen. Tom Cruise plays Detective John Anderton, the futuristic cop in charge of preventing homicides with the aid of three psychic visionaries called (Pre-Cogs) who float around in a liquid wading pool wired, drugged and having nightmares. Waving his arms like Leonard Bernstein in the orchestra pit, Anderton can download images of clues, suspects and crime scenes, then lead his futuristic crimebusters to the killers before they pull the trigger. With beady eyes, flexed jaw and a buzz cut, he's a man whose life is already so haunted by the abduction and murder of his only son that he looks and acts creepier than the Pre-Cogs. The world has apparently survived John Ashcroft, because the Justice Department thinks the Pre-Crime Unit is too controversial a concept to go national. In a subplot that goes nowhere, Irish hunk Colin Farrell is wasted as the dull F.B.I. investigator from the Attorney General's office who covets Anderton's job. The lulling narrative drones on until the tables turn and Anderton is named by the Pre-Cogs as the next murderer. From here, the movie turns from a whodunit into a who'll-do-it as the flawed hero (he's hooked on drugs) has 36 hours to solve his own case and clear his name by breaking into the Pre-Crime lab and downloading the info from the Pre-Cog who predicted it-and Mr. Spielberg sweats it all out, stretching the film's playing time to two hours plus.

270,AVA_Doc10_MinorityReport,AVA_Doc10_MinorityReport,AVA,Sci-Fi,Negative,Minority Report,"Based on the short story by Philip K. Dick, ""Minority Report"" marks the second futuristic, science-fiction epic Steven Spielberg has made in as many years (after what I believe to be his greatest achievement, ""A.I.: Artificial Intelligence""). For Spielberg, undeniably one of the most influential and visionary filmmakers of his time, the film almost seems tailor-made for his marvelous visual sense and stunning talent for storytelling. For all of its sweeping technical flourishes and seamless visual effects, however, ""Minority Report"" is as shallow and characteristically vacant as ""A.I."" was emotionally resonating and creatively groundbreaking. In other words, though it pains me to conclude, Steven Spielberg's latest opus is one of the weakest films he has made, to date. Set in a surprisingly realistic vision of what Washington, D.C. might look like in 2054, John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the top detective on the police force's relatively new Pre-Crime Unit. Through three pre-cog oracles whose minds hold the key to the future, the Pre-Crime Force, headed by Director Burgess (Max Von Sydow), is able to stop predestined murders before they occur. The alleged success of the program has cut down on major crimes in D.C. by ninety percent. When the latest murder suspect name comes up, Anderton is dismayed to learn that it is his own. Without never having met the victim before, Anderton is convinced that someone-possibly federal agent Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell), who is after his job-is trying to ruthlessly set him up. With the police suddenly after him, Anderton has no choice but to go on the run. Breaking into the Pre-Crime building, he kidnaps the most talented of the three pre-cogs, Agatha (Samantha Morton), convinced that what she knows about his future is the key to clearing his name and saving his life. The general premise of ""Minority Report"" is a novel one, fascinating in the way the world has developed enough in fifty years that the police force has begun acting, more or less, as God to citizens. The moral implications of such a debate-whether a person's future is predestined or capable of change-are thought-provoking, to be sure, but get lost in a screenplay (credited to Scott Frank and Jon Cohen) more interested in action set-pieces, and a film that chooses style over any form of hard-edged substance. While several of the action scenes are astonishingly executed, including a death-defying jump across cars hovering in the air, and a search for John by electronic spiders sent to check the retinas of an apartment complex's tenants, what surrounds them is a thoroughly unsatisfying emptiness posing as a study of serious-minded issues. Whatever deep-rooted involvement one might have grown to have in John Anderton's dire predicament proves sterile in a sea of blank faces posing as characters. Precious little is ever learned about John, except that he blames himself for his son's kidnapping six years ago, is separated from his wife (Kathryn Morris), and has a secret drug problem, and even fewer reasons are given for why we"
271,LVV_Doc1_Oblivion,LVV_Doc1_Oblivion,LVV,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion,"In the opening sequence ofOblivion, the voice of Tom Cruise (playing the film's protagonist, Commander Jack Harper) creeps onto the soundtrack and painstakingly explains the precise details of the film's backstory. The year is 2077. The Earth is all but abandoned. An alien population known as Scavengers (Scavs for short) invaded the moon, which in turn nearly destroyed the earth. Most humans have moved to a space station. Drones and technicians like Harper roam the earth, and so on and son on. A metric ton of exposition is slammed into that opening sequence, but here's what's peculiar: at the beginning of the second act, after Jack discovers a hibernating astronaut (Olga Kurylekno) and saves her, he sits her down and gives her the whole spiel again. Why? Is this a safeguard in case people showed up late? Do they think we didn't get it the first time? I have a theory. As Cruise was explaining the whole movie again, my mind started to wander. (It had nothing better to do.) I found myself re-imagining the film, up to that point,withoutthe Tom Cruise Explains It All voice-over - merely images of a ravished earth, followed by the jargon-heavy first act, establishing his work and daily routine. And guess what: in that one tiny alteration, the movie I made in my head was far superior to the one I was watching. Had we not been provided with that painfully labored exposition, had we been trusted to figure that info out for ourselves, or let it reveal itself organically (like when, say, he had to explain it to the astronaut),Oblivioncould have been... well, it still wouldn't have been a great movie. But it would have been a far more interesting one. And I found myself wondering if co-writer/director Joseph Kosinski had put that voice-over in originally, or if it was the result of prodding by the suits, a laBlade Runner. But that's the trouble with mainstream science fiction filmmaking these days: there's no expectation that an audience is capable of putting things together or waiting for a payoff, and there certainly aren't many filmmakers or executives willing to take the risk. The problem, it seems, is the desire of those who greenlight movies to lump science fiction in with action, and it's easy to guess why:Star Wars. Before 1977, there were occasional crossovers, but for the most part, science fiction was a genre purely unto itself, concerned with alien invasions and post-apocalyptic scenarios and subtextual parallels. After Lucas mashed up spaceships and swashbucklers, sci-fi was never the same. This is not to say that there haven't been great sci-fi/action movies: the originalStar Warstrilogy, of course, and the first twoTerminators, andAliens, and the firstMatrix. But those films worked, to some extent, in spite of themselves - because the fundamental purposes of great science fiction and great action are so diametrically opposed. Great science fiction is brainy and smart, fueled by Big Concepts and Grand Ideas. Most action films (and there are exceptions) are about"

But when that whatever arrives (and even before it does) the movie works as an experience that glorifies the megaplex ideal. I watched it in a very good IMAX theater in suburban Philadelphia that, like all IMAX theaters, had a guardrail sitting at the bottom of the screen. It seemed to be there expressly to prevent you from entering one of Tom Cruise's pores. Fully overwhelmed in IMAX might be the only way to watch this movie. It's been shot with a crispness that elevates the heart rate. Projected at that scale, you want to leave your seat and explore this postnuclear Earth, to walk the film's sands and marvel at the manner in which the geological table has been so fantastically upended that Manhattan erodes beneath dunes and decays at the base of canyons. (The year is 2073.) Oblivionoscillates between sites that are way up high and locations that are way down low, between the astral dark of outer space and the flashlit dankness of long-abandoned caves. Even at IMAX scale it remains thrillingly impossible to detect whether the orb-like drones that accompany Jack Harper, the wistful repairman Cruise plays, have true tactility or whether they're just projections from a hard drive. The drones perform surveillance, they're armed to the teeth, and their resemblance to eyeballs is a clever formal manifestation of their function, which is to hunt and exterminate aliens for an ominous entity called the Tet, whose twangy operations commander, Sally, is played by a scratchy video uplink of Melissa Leo. The orbs have a rapport with Jack that gives you thatBlade Runnerreplicant feeling about him. They break; he fixes them. When Jack and, by extension, the orbs happen upon a tiny survivalist civilization of human rebels - they're the (aliens,) and they're called Scavs - the orbs descend and instigate a fantastic firefight. Tremendous care has gone into making you believe that the orbs are whizzing around, flying into beams, and machine-gunning everyone. No matter its actual provenance, this ruined and depopulated Earth often feels breathtakingly real. But there's too much time to realize that whatOblivioncares about most is how good it looks. The director and cowriter Joseph Kosinski is a trained architect and visual-effects designer who wrote the graphic novel that became this movie. His expertise is in vastness and scale. He knows how to fill the camera frame and can orchestrate chaos and elaborate movement so that your ability to follow it is simple and your nervous system's response to its intensity is involuntary. His meticulousness is as painstaking as it was inTron: Legacy, another grand optical illusion that kept confusing commercial vanity with philosophical wonder. There he made light something you want to lick and wear and put inside you.Oblivionis something you want to be inside of. Upon entry, you'd have plenty of room to notice how hollow it is. Kosinski devotes the first hour"

The mix of derivative writing and brilliant production design really put me in a quandary with the film. On one hand, it was a visual masterpiece. On the other hand, it was a sad disappointment. To make matters worse, I was quite impressed with Joseph Kosinski's previous film (Tron: Legacy.) I grew up with (Tron,) and seeing his slick, modern update to the story counted as one of my favorite moments in the theaters in 2010. Sure, I knew it has severe pacing and story problems, but it was just so damn cool to watch. I was hoping for at least the same thing with (Oblivion.) I suppose I did get it to some degree. The look of the film is fantastic, and on the IMAX screen, it really works. The visual effects are mind-blowing and so realistic you will likely forget they are, in fact, generated in a computer. Similarly, the action sequences (when they actually get around to happening) are thrilling and exciting, if not sometimes apparent re-shoots of moments from (Tron: Legacy.) (If you don't believe me on that point, compare the canyon chase in this movie to the light-jet chase in (Tron: Legacy.)) Though, what (Oblivion) reminds me of is a second novel from an author who made a sudden splash with his or her first. Instead of delivering something new, the writer digs an old unpublished work from his or her writing trunk and takes the opportunity to get it out there for the readers. The problem is that while the author (or in this case, filmmaker) is in love with the piece, it features less refined and more amateurish content. In essence, there's a reason why this movie wasn't made before (Tron: Legacy) put Kosinski on the map... or grid. The story, and the characters, and the pacing is where (Oblivion) breaks down. It's not the cast, and it's not the design of the film. It's all that other (stuff) that makes a movie a movie, and unlike (Tron: Legacy,) no amount of slick production design and eye-popping visual effects will change that. That story is one that I've seen in many different pieces of science fiction literature and movies over the years. Tom Cruise stars as Jack, a custodian of sorts on Earth 60 years after a war made the planet uninhabitable. With his memory wiped, he and his partner/lover monitor and provide maintenance to drones that protect giant processors that are supposedly cleaning up the surface for the eventual return of the human race. However, when entities on the surface known as (scavs) (short for scavengers) bring down an ancient spacecraft, Jack starts to uncover startling secrets about himself and his mission. I could list the dozen or so movies that (Oblivion) mimics, but to do so would offer some pretty hefty spoilers. Suffice to say that there is very little original thought"
274,LVV_Doc4_Oblivion,LVV_Doc4_Oblivion,LVV,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion,"Squirming through the Tom Cruise sci-fi vehicleOblivion, I flashed back toNotting Hill, in which Julia Roberts plays a superstar visiting London to promote some deadly outer-space epic with white-on-white sets and a sleep-inducing hum.Oblivionis like that movie-within-a-movie: Everything in it feels 100 percent inauthentic. That vibe, as it happens, turns out to be intentional. But when the humans arrive, it's still a narcotic. The pity is that the film is about the war to liberate the human spirit from alien soul-snuffing exploiters and that Cruise is supposed to be our last best hope. In the long opening voice-over, his character, Jack (not Reacher), explains that (Scavengers) obliterated humankind: They blew up the moon and Nature did the rest. Humans beat the invaders back and then took off en masse to colonize a moon of Saturn, Titan. But a few people stayed behind to harvest the remaining resources and watch out for leftover (Scavs.) Jack is teamed with a Brit named Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), who sits in a giant mushroomlike flight tower reading data from (hydro rigs) and lethal drones. He flies around doing repairs and calling in those drones whenever there are signs of saboteurs. He also tells us that his memory has been wiped so that he won't spill any beans if grabbed by Scavs. Director Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy) thinksbig- big white impersonal settings on a big barren landscape under a big fractured moon with one big segment broken off and simply hanging, suspended in orbit, with a trail of little pieces floating around. But the sets just sit there. The first half-hour is Jack talking to Victoria on his headset, Jack fixing rigs, and Jack having sex with the eager-beaver Victoria. (Wow, does she want him.) They talk longingly of their imminent departure for Titan. Victoria speaks to an administrator on a screen called Sally (Melissa Leo). These scenes exert a strange fascination: They're so conscientiously neutral, so droningly dull that they almost pass for Stanley Kubrick-like. But Jack shares our boredom. He feels dislocated. He has visions of himself atop the Empire State Building with another woman - someone more compelling than his vaguely robotic partner. Someone played by Olga Kurylenko, this year's comely avatar of spirituality. When Jack finds a crashed spaceship with human passengers (including Olga) in suspended animation and a drone flies in and starts blasting them, he's flummoxed. Drones are supposed to kill Scavs, not humans! And certainly not Olga! Eventually, Jack is captured by beings wholooklike humans (but you never know), led by Morgan Freeman, who puffs happily on a cigar - and you would, too, if you had to do as little for a paycheck this size. He says he was intrigued when Jack found a book with a poem by Macaulay in which three Romans sacrifice themselves to save their city. That's when things get murky. I eventually figured outOblivion, but not while watching it. While watching it, I said, (What? What?) over the din of the explosions. It"
275,LVV_Doc5_Oblivion,LVV_Doc5_Oblivion,LVV,Sci-Fi,Negative,Oblivion,"It's apparent now, after two similarly pristine and vacuous productions, that Joseph Kosinski makes films as if he were building IKEA furniture: He follows a simple template, allen-keys the requisite pieces into place, and at the end of the process winds up with something both blandly functional and broadly appealing. It's worth remembering thatTRON: Legacybegan as nothing more than a glorified tech demo, a studio-backed sizzle reel intended to promote Kosinski's aesthetic proclivities as much as the forthcoming project itself. Though eventually expanded to (interminable) feature length,TRON: Legacyremained wafer-thin from conception to execution, fully realized as a distinctive look and feel, but made without regard for story, characters, or feeling. With Kosinski, superficiality seems a veritable guiding principle:TRON: Legacy's obsession with surfaces-the architecture of the world constructed from clean lines and gleaming neon blues-persists undiminished in his blockbuster follow-up, a film which exchanges the cool digital palette of its predecessor for something nominally earthier, but every bit as lifeless and cold. But much likeTRON: Legacy,Oblivion's defining quality isn't precision so much as the illusion thereof. It strains to establish an aura of formal rigor and artisanal meticulousness in every aspect of its design (the belabored exactness of its production design, the real-world feasibility of its future tech, the show-offish distance of its many long shots and long takes), presumably intended to eclipse the fact that, at its foundation,Oblivionis rather crudely assembled, an ad-hoc B movie composed of borrowed plot points and shopworn sci-fi cliches. Rarely has a veneer of consummate craftsmanship so conspicuously endeavored to compensate for the flimsiness of a film's conception, slathering every frame in so much high-gloss texture that it makes the work of Tarsem Singh seem like that of Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne.Oblivion's chief purpose-rather than, say, to relate an interesting story, or have us invest ourselves in the plight of believable characters, or articulate an idea about the world in which we live-is to erect a monument to itself: Its multi-million-dollar budget is directed toward shallow self-aggrandizement, forging lavish futurist skyscrapers and Emmerichian old-world wreckage from the expensive digital ether, and just generally illustrating the aftermath of our apocalypse with less imagination than disdain for the intelligence of its audience. It should be obvious within seconds thatOblivionis pure amateur hour even in the most rudimentary ways: As Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) blurts out a laughably clunky expository monologue in plaintive voiceover, we're brought up to speed on a war with an invading alien army that, once lone-survivor Julia (Olga Kurylenko) is introduced into the proceedings, is explained again in functional dialogue that instantly renders its ham-fisted opening redundant. This sort of viewer-insulting writing is entirely typical of the film's continuing deference to simplicity, where every sensationalistic twist is either telegraphed too far in advance or all too cheaply withheld, the sum total of its gasp-stacking turnabouts little more thanMoonmeets a thinly veiledLa Jetee-or, frankly, any other two science-fiction films with novel twists you'd care to name, sinceOblivionis indiscriminate about the sources it rips off.

276,LVV_Doc6_Oblivion,LVV_Doc6_Oblivion,LVV,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"(Oblivion) looks marvelous, in the deliciously dystopian way of so many post-apocalyptic films. It's set in 2077, after alien invaders called Scavengers (or (Scavs)) have laid waste to our moon, leading to cataclysmic floods and earthquakes that have ravaged Earth. The film features gorgeous CGI shots of such broken, half-buried landmarks as the Washington Monument and the Empire State Building, whose observation deck can now be accessed by walking onto it from a mountain of rubble. It's the kind of film that's perfect for the Imax formatin which some theaters are offering it. Just be warned that this means it's also very, very loud. One joker at a preview screening shouted, (Volume!) as the film was barely getting under way, to much laughter. He wasn't complaining that it was too quiet. It ought to look good. The movie, by director Joseph Kosinski ((Tron: Legacy)), is said to be based on a graphic novel by Kosinski and comic book writer Arvid Nelson. Although that book was never published - and probably never will be - the mock-up of the story drew the attention of star Tom Cruise, along with not one, but two, studios. Disney, which originally had the rights, ultimately gave them up to Universal, which made the film. It's an engrossing, if complicated and twisty, story, with plentiful sci-fi action and a provocative subtext about the nature of the human soul. At times, however, the balance between those two things feels off. Some of the fight sequences, which involve robotic flying (drones) mounted with guns, go on a bit longer than is strictly necessary. Cruise plays Jack Harper, a futuristic maintenance man whose dangerous job consists of repairing the drones that patrol Earth, an unpopulated wasteland where giant (hydro rigs) convert seawater into energy to be used by what's left of the human race, which has relocated to a colony on one of Saturn's moons. Although we've won the war against the Scavs, there are still some left, and they like to sabotage the hydro rigs and the drones almost as much as they enjoy trying to kill Jack. He and his partner/lover, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), who provides backup from a command center in the clouds, have their work cut out for them, but it's more routine than glamorous. (We're the mop-up crew,) Jack says. All is not as it appears, however. That scenario, as laid out by Jack in voice-over narration, soon starts to show cracks. The Scavs' terrorist-style activities pick up, and a spacecraft loaded with humans in suspended animation crash-lands on Earth, drawn by an electronic beacon emanating from the surface. It's suddenly as if the order of Jack's world is turned upside down, including his understanding of who the good guys and the bad guys are. Even Jack and Victoria's boss, Sally (Melissa Leo), who supervises their work from an orbiting satellite called the Tet, starts to seem not quite so maternal as she did at the beginning of the film. More important, Jack starts"
277,LVV_Doc7_Oblivion,LVV_Doc7_Oblivion,LVV,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"Film genres have their boom years and their bust years. Every genre has a big hit here and a big hit there every year, but, every now and then, a single year will have multiple watershed films that transcend and extend the genre. In the realm of science fiction, the years of 1968 (2001: A Space OdysseyandPlanet of the Apes), 1977 (Close Encounters of the Third KindandStar Wars), and 1997 (Gattaca, Contact, The Fifth Element, Men in Black,andStarship Troopers) really stand out historically as years were multiple films made a significant impact to the genre and not just the box office. Time will tell, but we may have just had one go by in 2011 (Source Code,Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Another Earth,Melancholia, Paul, Real Steel,X-Men: First Class,and, to a lesser degree,Transformers: Dark of the Moon). In this critics opinion, the very best year for science fictionin film history was easily 1982, boastingE.T. the Extra Terrestrial, Blade Runner, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,Tron,andThe Thing. All have gone on to be considered classics, groundbreakers, and trendsetters in their own right. Once we finish 2013, there's a good chance this year might join that group and maybe even rival 1982. The ambitious (on paper anyways) science fiction slate coming in 2013 includesStar Trek Into Darkness, Iron Man 3,Thor: The Dark World, Vin Diesel returning toRiddick, Will Smith and Jaden Smith inAfter Earth, the March flopThe Host, the indie flickUpside Down,Neill Blomkamp'sDistrict 9follow-upElysium,Alfonso Cuaran'sChildren of Menfollow-upGravity, the summer slugfestPacific Rim, the zombie blockbusterWorld War Z,andthe hotly anticipated novel adaptations ofEnder's GameandThe Hunger Games: Catching Fire. ""Loaded"" is an understatement and one more of those headliners is out this weekend. The first really legitimate film that gets this year of science fiction started isOblivion. From the producers ofRise of the Planet of the Apesand Joseph Kosinski, the kinetic director ofTron: Legacy(a movie I loved),Tom Cruise returns to science fiction for the first time in eight years since 2005's Spielberg juggernautWar of the Worlds. Oblivion, against recent trend, actually moved its release date earlier from a summer release this July to late April, while some of its peers likeJack the Giant SlayerandG.I. Joe: Retributionexperienced nearly year-long delays to be here in the spring of 2013. Filled with amazing post-apocalyptic spectacle, dazzling action sequences, and a heady story of twists and turns, the challenge ofOblivionis whether or not you, as the audience, can allow the strong visuals to make up for the weak narrative. This filmwill not go down as a 1982-level classic and borrows too many elements from other movies includingThe Matrix, Planet of the Apes, WALL-E,Tarkovsky and Soderbergh's takes onSolaris,Duncan Jones's under-seenMoon, and even a littleDark City,butOblivionstillhas an unmistakable and impressive draw to it. Like all good science fiction, this film stays serious, asks big questions, and takes us to forgivablyimplausible places. That third element might sound like a knock, but that implausible creativity is what sets science fiction apart from other genres. Science fiction is where the unbelievable comes"
278,LVV_Doc8_Oblivion,LVV_Doc8_Oblivion,LVV,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"(Oblivion) is a competently made sci-fi action movie - something that can't be said about the majority of the genre. Though many of the prominent futurism themes can be linked back to earlier films, and a few loose ends might not be tied up with the sturdiest of knots, the structure and plot twists keep the intrigue high while the action paces itself nicely alongside the unfolding mystery. Tom Cruise makes a compelling hero and the setup is a savvy blend of dystopian invention and amnesia-induced identity loss. The list of films (Oblivion) borrows from is a long one, but the concepts are all executed cleverly and proficiently, resulting in an epic space opus that presents far more moments of awe than head-scratching queries. The year is 2077 and Earth has been left nearly uninhabitable after a brutal war against an invading alien species known as (Scavengers.) While the remnants of humanity have been gathered aboard the Tet, an enormous pyramidal space station that will eventually carry the survivors to a new home on one of Saturn's moons, technician Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and his partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) remain on Earth to monitor and perform maintenance on giant hydro-rigs and the protective, heavily armed robot drones that guard them. When a spaceship crash-lands nearby and Jack investigates, he rescues from the wreckage Julia (Olga Kurylenko), a mysterious woman whose appearance sets into motion the discovery of a massive conspiracy that will place the very fate of mankind in Jack's hands. (Oblivion) is heady, weighty, and cerebral science-fiction, foregoing the little green man angle for a much more sinister and complex alien incursion. In terms of postapocalyptic, futuristic thrillers, borrowing randomly from (The Road Warrior,) (2001: A Space Odyssey,) (Moon,) (The Matrix,( and (Total Recall,) it's a highly ambitious and largely successful twist, toying with existential and deterministic viewpoints while smartly avoiding depressing bouts of violence or sacrifice. Its focus on altering or interfering with memories is augmented perfectly by the heavily synthesized soundtrack, itself lending to the dreamlike qualities of Jack's remembrances. An engaging mystery, (Oblivion) forces viewers to wait nearly two hours before giving up any secrets; but to the film's credit, the protracted anticipation is delightful. Mind-boggling and artistically visionary, the many answers it finally grapples with will probably raise further investigations into the various aspects less examined, but the climactic conclusion is pleasantly resolute - even if specific details can be rationalized with the term (gaping plot holes.) An exemplary fit for IMAX screens, (Oblivion) boasts outstanding visuals that add tremendously to the scope of the project. Immense exterior shots and sets introduce the audience to a uniquely fascinating world, with unfriendly terrain, monumental wreckage, and obscured paradises. The interior designs are just as spectacular, though used much more sparingly. The obvious budget for special effects definitely helps establish and stabilize the pioneering perspective; visual wizardry occasionally substitutes for inchoate plot points. But perhaps most impressive of all is the origins of the story, starting as"
279,LVV_Doc9_Oblivion,LVV_Doc9_Oblivion,LVV,Sci-Fi,Positive,Oblivion,"Since his questionable comments and ill advised sofasaults on Oprah, Tom Cruise has become an actor that many people love to hate. But those things are in the past and as wacky as they were they still didn't effect the level of his onscreen work. He's a talented actor who throughout his career has tackled a wide variety of roles in iconic 80's cheesefests, stirring and emotional dramas, big budgeted franchises, and even sci-fi thrillers. Now he returns to the science fiction genre in (Oblivion), a much more direct and vast sci-fi picture than Cruise's other efforts. (Oblivion) is co-written and directed by Joseph Kosinski, the man behind Disney's $400 million money maker (Tron: Legacy). Disney originally purchased the rights to (Oblivion) in hopes of repeating Tron's success but later relinquished the rights. It was quickly gobbled up by Universal Studios with Tom Cruise and Jessica Chastain set to star in the picture. Chastain would eventually drop out for (Zero Dark Thirty) with Olga Kurylenko replacing her. The movie is based on Kosinski's unpublished graphic novel and was given an ambitious $120 million budget. I have to say I was really excited for (Oblivion)even though the studio was very cryptic in regards to the film's details. That's a good approach to take because I found that the less you know going in the more effective the story will be. And for me it was quite effective. (Oblivion) doesn't fall into the category of a science fiction masterpiece but thanks to its visionary conception, stunning effects, and some strong committed performances it doesn't miss by much. Now there have been three main criticisms hurled at (Oblivion). Some have complained about its thin plot. Others took off points for its lack of originality. And yet others have had problems with the lack of any meaningful character development. I certainly don't flippantly dismiss any of these gripes but I don't necessarily agree with them either. There's a lot going on in (Oblivion) and while it does borrow from several other sci-fi pictures, the same could be said for most science fiction. As for the lack of character development, that may be true but I found there to be a good and needed reason for it. Like I said the less you know the better so I'm not going to spoil anything by divulging any significant details. The film is set in 2077 during the aftermath of a war with an alien species known as the Scavengers. The Scavs (as they're affectionally called) destroyed our moon which sent Earth into a series of natural and environmental convulsions. A full invasion of Earth followed. The humans won the war but the planet was left ravaged and in disrepair. The surviving population now inhabit one of Saturn's moons called Titan. Now if a sci-fi movie wants to score points with me just give me a futuristic world that's not only visually impressive but that I can get lost in. That certainly happened here and even if"

The opening of films like Joseph Kosinski'sObliviontend to be about world-building, about creating a future and establishing its rules. The second act lets the characters explore and make significant decisions. But like Leo Tolstoy's happy families, science-fiction movie endings tend to all be alike, a big pileup of chases and explosions. The acts are extended inOblivion, which applies an intriguingly complicated mixture of wonder and workaday tedium to its world-building, then lays on the developments fast and thick in the discovery phase. But it all comes down to blowing things up in the end. Tom Cruise and Andrea Riseborough star as a placid couple living in a spectacular, spartan glass-and-steel spire in the post-apocalyptic ruins of New York City. As Cruise establishes in a tediously overstuffed opening monologue, aliens called Scavengers, or (Scavs,) attacked Earth 50 years ago, and the battle to drive them out left Earth ravaged and unlivable. The remnants of humanity are moving to Saturn's moon Titan, once a series of giant harvesters have turned the oceans into fuel. Cruise, Riseborough, and a handful of sinister gun-bots are the last people pulling guard duty on the planet, protecting the harvesters from the scattered Scavs until their deployment ends in a few weeks, and reporting in to mildly sinister mission controller Melissa Leo.In spite of that hushed, heavily oversold opening monologue, co-writer/director Kosinski takes his time in unfurlingOblivion's world, from Earth's stark, abandoned, IMAX-friendly vistas to Cruise and Riseborough's relationship.Oblivionshines in the moments that are least crucial to the plot, as Cruise explores a thunderstorm in his sleek futuristic personal conveyance, or Riseborough trades pleasantries with Leo that seem just a bit too barbed. An unsettling sense of not-quite-right coats all of the film's steely surfaces, and Kosinski and his co-writers give audiences plenty of time to absorb the unease and gear up for the action. Oblivion's primary issue is that everything that comes next supposedly emerges from Cruise's character's humanity, curiosity, and personality, yet given that he's Tom Cruise, he doesn't evince much of any of these things. His Earth-loving, nightmare-having, order-disobeying daredevil comes across as the exact same intent, vaguely desperate, vaguely angry protagonist he played inMinority Reportand theMission: Impossiblemovies, and there's nothing here to differentiate him from Generic Heroic Template To Be Personalized Later. Instead,Oblivion's personality comes from the CGI production design; co-writer/director Kosinski and cinematographer Claudio Miranda (Life Of Pi) previously worked together on Kosinski's debut,Tron: Legacy, which had a similar style-over-character aesthetic, with plenty of gloss and no warmth.Oblivionis a terrific-looking movie, alternating spare, sterile environments with homey organic ones, and making both look tremendously pretty. Kosinski also handles his action well, with cut-and-dried clarity and edge-of-seat energy. And while the story developments heavily echo other science-fiction films-some classic, some recent, but all earlier to the finish line on these particular plotlines-Kosinski and his screenwriting partners wind them into the action effectively. But this remains the kind"

Many might consider the answer obvious: Clearly, there can *never* be enough Batmen. This was not always the case. Following 1966's *Batman*, the world went over three decades without another movie starring the Caped Crusader. That changed in 1989 with Tim Burton's *Batman*. The troubled production history and its being directed by a mostly unproven cult filmmaker made the movie's blockbuster achievement something of a surprise. It was such a shock, in fact, that Warner Bros. botched most of the movies that followed. Burton's 1992 sequel *Batman Returns* had a more assured gothic sensibility (meaning Siouxsie and the Banshees, not flying buttresses). But despite Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito's best efforts at cackling and purring villainy, it missed Jack Nicholson's giddy anarchy, not to mention the wonderfully strange Prince soundtrack. Joel Schumacher's two efforts - *Batman Forever* (1995) and *Batman & Robin* (1997)- were everything wrong with peak 1990s' Hollywood, when the studios just hurled millions of dollars and a random array of A- and B-list stars at a nonsensical screenplay and hoped there were enough explosions to distract the audience. There were no Batman movies for eight years. The world got by. But other comic franchises from Blade to Spider-man, the X-Men, Hellboy, and the Incredible Hulk were given the green light in that time. This meant that the box office and merchandising revenue to be made off a legacy superhero like Batman was too enticing to resist. Many failed attempts to revive the franchise for a post-Schumacher era finally led to the Christopher Nolan trilogy: *Batman Begins* (2005), *The Dark Knight* (2008), and *The Dark Knight Rises* (2012). Just as Burton's *Batman* was hailed for hauling the hero back into moody darkness after being sullied by the Adam West Batman's self-aware humor, Nolan's films were praised for using a more mythic tone to wash away the ignominy of Schumacher's half-hearted camp. The Nolan trilogy was far from perfect. Still, his movies had a sweeping grandeur and emotional texture not seen before or even since in the superhero canon, despite Zack Snyder's strenuous but subpar efforts. By the time *The Dark Knight Rises* rumbled to its conclusion, it felt as though Nolan had mined the Batman mythology for just about all that it had. The trilogy made dramatic sense on its own, not as part of a larger interlocking DC universe of never-ending sequels and reboots and cross-overs. But all together, the Nolan films raked in about $2.4 billion, so there was no way the studio would give Batman a rest. Even though they should have. Now we have the glowering Ben Affleck Batman barking orders at his fellow Justice Leaguers in the Zack Snyder movies like a retired corporate executive who now spends all day at the gym yelling at cable news. Will Arnett does his best Bale grumble imitation in the Lego movies. Robert Pattinson delivers possibly the most redundant"
282,JWG_Doc2_Batman,JWG_Doc2_Batman,JWG,Sci-Fi,Negative,Batman,"One thing you can say about THE BATMAN without fear of contradiction is that there is a lot of it. Clocking in at three hours or so, it packs in enough plot for a trilogy, as though all concerned fretted that this might be their only shot at the rebooted DC franchise. Fear not, though. There is a teaser for a sequel, just in case this midnight black interpretation catches on with fans. This Batman, or rather, The Batman, is Robert Pattinson, an emo superhero with a pinched and pained look while out of the mask as Bruce Wayne. This scion of the uber-wealthy Wayne family is, as those familiar with story know, still haunted by the murder of his parents, who were gunned down right before his eyes. As a result, he has channeled his angst into his alter ego, The Batman, who administers his own brand of vigilante justice with the help of Lt. Jim Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) and Gordon's ability to walk the masked one into crime scenes when needed, or just y flicking on the Bat Signal to let the Dark Knight know trouble is afoot. The latest crime scene is of that of Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr (Rupert Penry-Jones), running for re-election on a family values platform that comes unraveled when his killer, The Riddler (Paul Dano), arranges for surveillance photos of Mitchell and his side-squeeze, desperate Russian emigree Annika (Hana Hrzic), to be emailed to all available media outlets there in Gotham City. The hunt for that side-squeeze, as well as The Riddler himself, leads The Batman to the sort of mob-controlled club where the elite can mix with the dregs and everyone has a good, felonious time. There he meets Selena (Zoe Kravitz), a waitress in iconic boots who is also searching for that side-squeeze because she was not only her roommate, but also her best friend. At least. In no time at all, The Batman has discovered that Selena is a fellow vigilante, unnamed but the owner of many cats and a disguise that includes a pussy hat. They seem destined for each other, and not just because they both prefer getting around the mean streets of Gotham on motorcycles. Also in play are family secrets, political corruption, the inherent violence of the class system, and a drug trade of epic proportions. Rather than neatly folding these elements into a tidy plot, we get them sequentially, but not artfully. There is also a hint about just how unlimited the Wayne family fortune is and is the one element that is dropped almost as soon as it appears that should have been explored further. Even in this already crowded opus. As for why Selena never closed the refrigerator in her apartment after discovering it had been ransacked, perhaps that's a question that will be addressed in the director's cut. The story provides the delivery system for some beautifully realized visuals, much as even the blandest of cakes can provide the delivery system for"
283,JWG_Doc3_Batman,JWG_Doc3_Batman,JWG,Sci-Fi,Negative,Batman,"Somewhere inside *The Batman* there's a taut, slow-burning, two-hour crime drama right out of the 1970s golden decade of film. Unfortunately, director [Matt Reeves](https://popmatters.com/tag/matt-reeves) and co-writer Peter Craig gorged themselves on the Batman mythos and wound up creating a sluggish, over-stuffed draft of a mini-series awkwardly crammed into movie form. Falling in love with Gotham itself, they spend a lot of time presenting an interminable link-footage travelogue of characters driving to and fro, forgetting that Gotham on film has always been '70s-'80s post-bankruptcy New York City, the most over-exposed cityscape in film history. The last thing anyone needs is an extensive tour of such a standard-issue backdrop. During the film's production, its creators also appear to have lost interest in their genuinely compelling central storyline, leading them to drown it in an indigestible gooey topping of expendable sub-plots. It's as if they were thinking, ""We need to wedge in an emotional context involving a loyal family retainer here but get it over in as little time as possible! Can we unnecessarily flag biographical connections between characters, please? Oh, don't forget to shoehorn in the irrelevant late cameo for a popular character! We need urban blight cliches on set, please! Can someone make up a new drug for no reason? Give Wayne a secretary but only give her 20 words. Where are the sad orphans and pitiful drug users I ordered?"" The reasons for The Penguin to even be in this film are tenuous at best while most other side-plots never even rise to the level of red herrings. However, very early in the film's interminable running time was a scene that stunned me. Unfortunately, that scene was when Robert Pattinson's Batman (aka Bruce Wayne) spies on Zoe Kravitz's Selina Kyle (aka Catwoman) as she undresses. It's a well-worn cliche that has always been tone-deaf to the fact that in real life - even if it was Pattinson himself ogling a woman through binoculars - it would still be creepy, disturbing, and gross. Miraculously, there are still film executives who feel that it is unrealistic, nay impossible, not to include footage dwelling on a hot female body in a way that doesn't advance the plot, develop a relationship, or add any crucial subtext. Batman's presence occurs while looking for a woman, Annika Koslov (Hana Hrzic), who it turns out is hiding at Kyle's apartment. While failing the Bechdel Test by permitting only the most stunted communication between the two women, the film prioritizes cramming in an insinuation that Kyle is bisexual. The film rejects the potentially more powerful idea that mutually supportive friendships are vital to working-class women with precarious lives, in favor of ramping up the sexualization. Rather than lending significance to Kyle's sapphic side, the film rests on the cliche that lesbians can be 'cured' by heterosexual exposure, with Kyle converted as soon as a sufficiently hyper-masculine archetype, the Batman, walks into her life. This depthless portrayal is an instance of the strategic use of bisexuality where openness to"
284,JWG_Doc4_Batman,JWG_Doc4_Batman,JWG,Sci-Fi,Negative,Batman,"Over the last several decades, we have seen a number of different iterations of Batman come and go, from the early days of the serials, to the late '60s with Adam West, to the later film adaptations with Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney, and Ben Affleck. And now, Warner Bros. has decided to reboot the series once again, this time with the intriguing choice of Robert Pattinson as the legendary Dark Knight. However, this version, from director/co-writer Matt Reeves, is not only a much darker approach, but it also goes back to the original source material, where the titular hero was a full-on detective. Turning the franchise on its head like this was certainly a fascinating gamble, but would it prove to be the right direction to take the beloved character? The film opens as the Mayor of Gotham City is murdered by a mysterious psychopath called The Riddler (Paul Dano). The crime is investigated by Batman (Robert Pattinson), aka billionaire Bruce Wayne (two years into his crime-fighting job), and Lieutenant James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) of the GCPD. A message is left at the crime scene for Batman, leading him deeper into The Riddler's game, ultimately entangling him with Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), a young woman attempting to track down her friend, Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), a major crime lord in Gotham, and Falcone's right-hand man, The Penguin (Colin Farrell), with various pieces of the past coming to light along the way. It was no secret that there had been a lot of trouble getting the character of Batman up and going again after Christopher Nolan completed his outstanding trilogy in 2012. Ben Affleck was a decent fit for the part, but he just happened to be plagued with some pretty awful writing when it came to ""Batman vs. Superman"" and ""Justice League."" In that regard, it made perfect sense to start again from the ground up, which brings us to Matt Reeves' new, even moodier & darker version. Starting off with the high points, the film is very well shot by recent Oscar-winning cinematographer Greig Fraser (""Dune""). As mentioned, it's a very dark film, but the composition throughout is very skillfully executed, making for a grand visual feast. And speaking of grand, Oscar winner Michael Giacchino provides a suitably epic score to accompany the grand scale of the film. Lastly, if one person had to be singled out of this entire cast, it would have to be John Turturro, who gives the standout performance of the film as crime boss Carmine Falcone, despite having a rather short amount of screen time. Unfortunately, now we need to delve into what doesn't work about the film, which is, sadly, quite a bit. However, its number one issue is simply that Matt Reeves and Peter Craig's screenplay is rather weak. It was definitely an intriguing idea to go back to Batman's roots as a great detective to explore an area that we don't get to see very much of, but their"
285,JWG_Doc5_Batman,JWG_Doc5_Batman,JWG,Sci-Fi,Negative,Batman,"*Hockey Pads* Like the Nirvana song that opens and closes *The Batman*, there's ""Something in the Way"" of Matt Reeves' new film that prevents it from being a great comic book movie: it seems embarrassed to have been based on comic books. How can this be? Reeves himself has said in interviews that he and co-writer Peter Craig drew inspiration from famous Dark Knight storylines like ""The Long Halloween"", ""Dark Victory"", and ""Hush"". To be clear, *The Batman* has no qualms about being a comic book movie. At many (many, many) points it steals liberally from the best. But the pre-release hype surrounding Warner Bros' third big-screen iteration of the Caped Crusader in two decades tells you everything you need to know about the project's drawing board flaws. **Not-So-Secret Origins** Early on, fans gobbled up the prospect of a Batman who was more focused on detective work than fighting colorful villains in larger-than-life set pieces. I was one of them, especially when Ben Affleck was still attached to star in the project. Zack Snyder's gloomy [superhero melange](https://youtu.be/jG1_Tm61Lhc) barely gave the Oscar winner anything to do, much less allow breathing room to develop his character. Affleck's version of Bruce Wayne was also middle-aged and plenty world-weary, promising a take on crimefighting we hadn't yet seen from this franchise. At some point, Affleck left the project and Robert Pattinson was tapped to strap on the utility belt. Solid choice, I thought, from an acting standpoint (post-[*Twilight*](https://kickseat.com/written-review/2010/7/1/the-twilight-saga-eclipse-2010.html?rq=Twilight)/[Harry Potter](https://youtu.be/ofcD8BG9DZU) mega-fandom, Pattinson has shed the heartthrob label and consistently demonstrated his chops as a performer). But I got the sneaking suspicion that skewing the role younger would steer *The Batman* into origin-story territory-a far too familiar place for this franchise. Still, as a lifelong comics fan, I was excited for a new *Batman* movie whose creative team seemed equally jazzed to share a bold vision for the movies rooted in the elements that make reading DC Comics a (mostly) rewarding experience. I'm still waiting. **Four-Color Fears** Just after *The Batman* let out, I visited a nearby bookstore and flipped through the collected editions of ""The Long Halloween"" and ""Hush"". In this moment, my problems with Reeves' film came into focus. Though these storylines rely heavily on mystery and detective work,* the books themselves are vibrant as hell and full of unabashedly comic book characters. From Killer Croc to The Joker to Mad Hatter and many other rogues, it's clear that writer Jeph Loeb and artists Tim Sale (""The Long Halloween"") and Jim Lee (""Hush"") were deeply committed to telling serious and elaborate stories with characters who might otherwise have been easily written off due to their outsized proportions and crayon box aesthetics. Reeves' *Batman* is anti-colorful, with scenes doused in alternating monochrome of piss yellow, jazz club blue, and murky black (punctuated by the occasional blood red)-the distinct palettes of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy fused together into a single dour feature. I don't mind moody and oppressive films. Reeves and DP Greig Fraser give"
286,JWG_Doc6_Batman,JWG_Doc6_Batman,JWG,Sci-Fi,Positive,Batman,"Matt Reeves' [*The Batman*](http://cbr.com/tag/the-batman) is a meticulously crafted film that takes the character back to his pulpier, noir-driven roots to delightful results. It's a genuine detective story that embraces the genre wholeheartedly and the nasty details inherent to it, meaning that Reeves gets to deliver not only riveting action set pieces but also truly unnerving horror set pieces along the way. One such moment is the film's opening sequence. It is a disturbing tone-setter for the film that Reeves packs to the brim with visual references and homages, [not just to Batman stories](https://www.cbr.com/the-batman-sequel-announced-warner-bros-dc/), but to the classic films whose influence only grows more palpable as *The Batman* goes on. On paper, this is a pretty straightforward scene. [The Riddler infiltrates](https://www.cbr.com/batman-when-did-riddler-first-tell-batman-riddle-me-this/) the home of Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell Jr. and murders him before beginning to deface his body with duct tape. But the true ingenuity of the work comes in how Reeves and [Academy Award-winning cinematographer Greig Fraser](https://www.cbr.com/dune-oscars-2022-roundup/) stage and photograph the sequence. ## The Batman Puts the Audience in The Riddler's Point of View *The Batman* opens on a long shot, peering through a scope into Mitchell's home. Though the audience is initially unaware of whose point of view this is, the agile movement of the camera, the visual artifice of the scope's lens and the audible deep breathing all convey that this is distinctly putting viewers in *someone's* shoes. Brilliantly, Reeves keeps viewers here for an extended period of time, forcing the audience to become voyeurs themselves, observing the internal lives of the Mitchell family. This sustained long-distance shot and foregrounding of voyeurism is directly reminiscent of the titular shot of [Francis Ford Coppola's *The Conversation*](https://www.cbr.com/james-gunn-francis-ford-coppola-cinema-discussion-marvel/), in which a surveillance expert is hired to record a mysterious conversation happening in a public place from a great distance. With *The Conversation* itself, Coppola was pulling from similarly themed voyeuristic works such as Powell's *Peeping Tom* and Antonioni's *Blowup.* Years later, both *Blowup* and *The Conversation* would go on to serve as noted influences on De Palma's *Blow Out.* Thus, through directly visually quoting this film, *The Batman* is aligning itself with a long lineage of films exploring voyeurism, a theme that will go on to become integral to its story. Also, within this first shot, Mitchell and his wife are seen playing with their son, who is dressed up as a ninja for Halloween. Upon first viewing, without any narrative context yet established, this martial arts-infatuated child with wealthy parents immediately conjures thoughts of a young Bruce Wayne. But Reeves utilizes this to subvert expectations in very much the same way [Burton does in his 1989 *Batman*](https://www.cbr.com/mcdonalds-ruined-tim-burton-third-batman-movie/). That film similarly opens with wealthy parents and a young boy (who the audience initially assume is Bruce Wayne) being the victims of a crime, only for Batman to show up and save the day. Reeves pays homage to the earlier film while also telegraphing to the audience that he's aware of how familiar this story is to viewers, and he's going to"
287,JWG_Doc7_Batman,JWG_Doc7_Batman,JWG,Sci-Fi,Positive,Batman,"At the start of this new Batman movie, Bruce Wayne's voiceover talks about how his identity as the Batman has made criminals in Gotham City more fearful. They think he's lurking in the shadows, hiding down alleys, waiting to take them out. The very first reveal of ""The Batman"" in this movie has him literally walking out of the shadows, emerging from the pitch-black darkness to confront a group of hoodlums attacking a man on a subway platform. The darkness that permeates Gotham City is present in every frame of ***The Batman-***, it's unavoidable, a lesson that Batman comes to learn. This is the ultimate gritty, grimy Gotham City noir movie - easily the best Batman movie since *The Dark Knight* ([read my old review](https://www.firstshowing.net/2008/the-dark-knight-an-extraordinary-cinematic-revolution/)). It's so incredibly dark that it's almost hard to see what's going on at times, but that's a feature not a bug. **Matt Reeves** has created one of the darkest Batman movies yet, both in tone and visual style, and it's an exhilarating big screen experience. *The Batman* is exactly the movie that Matt Reeves pitched. He's been telling us what it is from the very start - a rain-drenched, *Chinatown*-inspired, full-on noir detective story of Batman's early years in Gotham City, as he struggles to figure out whether or not he's actually making a difference. It's ""Year 2"" for Bruce Wayne as the ""Batman"". He's already invested in the Bat persona, established himself as a ""masked vigilante"", and dedicated himself to cleaning up the scum of Gotham. But is it working? Is it making a positive difference? Or is he only making things worse? It's a question he doesn't want to ask, and really doesn't want to answer, but when a murderer who calls himself The Riddler starts taking out Gotham's elite, he is forced to confront the truth about the Batman's impact so far. The whole movie is about Bruce wondering whether he should ever cross ""the line"" and what even is that line to begin with. What he learns is: don't try to kill, try to help. I'm already a huge fan of Matt Reeves - he never misses. Everything he has made is exceptional - from his vampire remake *Let Me In* to his monster mash *Cloverfield* to his two phenomenal *Apes* films. *The Batman* once again proves that he is a genuine visionary filmmaker who knows how to melt our minds visually while weaving us through the story. He's a filmmaker that cares about the visual experience as much as the story. He has a grand vision and he cares about making sure that vision is a part of every aspect of the filmmaking process. The cinematography by DP **Greig Fraser** is spectacular, much more meticulous and textured than most movies. The sound work and production design are top notch, elevating the storytelling with tangible realism throughout. The score by **Michael Giacchino** brings even more depth. The performances are all layered and nuanced, every last cop and security guard even"
288,JWG_Doc8_Batman,JWG_Doc8_Batman,JWG,Sci-Fi,Positive,Batman,"The Batman films that I have lasting and fond impressions of are those that do daring things and thrilled me in the theatre. They're the ones who upset my expectations of The Bat and his nocturnal obsessions. They are the ones that make what is, at heart, a vigilante story about a rich and privileged white dude beating the stuffing out of criminals in the streets relatable in some way. I'm not particularly fond of millionaires but part of what any Batman film has to do is make you care about his mission of vengeance. **THE BATMAN** asks what happens when vengeance isn't enough anymore. What happens when the people that you are trying to save need something more? **THE BATMAN** answers this and makes us care about his mission. Thanks to the fine direction by Matt Reeves and the equally laudable acting work of Robert Pattinson (*Tenet, [The Lighthouse](https://www.nightmarishconjurings.com/2020/01/07/blu-ray-dvd-review-the-lighthouse/)*), Zoe Kravitz (""Big Little Lies"", *Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald*), Paul Dano (*Love & Mercy, 12 Years a Slave*) as Edward Nashton aka The Riddler, Jeffrey Wright ([*No Time to Die*](https://www.nightmarishconjurings.com/2021/09/28/nightmarish-detour-review-no-time-to-die/), ""Westworld"") as Lt. James Gordon, John Turturro (*Transformers* films, ""The Plot Against America"") as Carmine Falcone, Peter Sarsgaard (*The Magnificent Seven, Interrogation*) as Gotham D.A. Gil Colson, Jayme Lawson (*Farewell Amor*) as mayoral candidate Bella Reel, Andy Serkis (*the Planet of the Apes* films, *Black Panther*) as Alfred and Colin Farrell (*[The Gentlemen](https://www.nightmarishconjurings.com/2020/01/22/nightmarish-detour-review-the-gentlemen/), Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them*) as Oz, aka The Penguin. If I have said it once, I have said it a half dozen times. The only real reason to continue to remake, reboot, or make sequels to a film franchise is if you bring something new and exciting to the mix. **THE BATMAN** has succeeded in doing so with flying Chiroptera colors. Matt Reeves has brought another startling and fresh take to an already extant series and given it a reason to exist artistically. Just in fairly recent memory, you have the 1960s admittedly entertaining but campy Adam West television show. You have the Tim Burton series that morphed into the Joel Schumacher series. Then there's the Christopher Nolan series, which was also admittedly quite good when it was firing on all cylinders. You have Ben Affleck from the Zach Snyder DCEU. I'm not really going to say anything bad about the rest of them. All of them have their fans and their good points. But what Matt Reeves, director, and co-writer, of the film has done is that he has taken the basic idea in a different and fresh direction. Like his reboot of *The Planet Of The Apes* series that no one thought would recover after the Tim Burton embarrassment in 2001, he brought a seriousness and a love of the material that brought something back to *The Planet Of The Apes* films. Here, with **THE BATMAN**, Reeves has performed a similar feat. What Reeves has done is strip the idea of a Batman movie back down to its emotional core."
289,JWG_Doc9_Batman,JWG_Doc9_Batman,JWG,Sci-Fi,Positive,Batman,"[Matt Reeves](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0716257/) is a director who has always delivered against the odds. An English language remake of *Let The Right One In*? Terrible idea and yet *[Let Me In](https://www.flickfeast.co.uk/feature/letmein2010-2/)* was a great take on the story. Turning a reboot of the *Planet Of The Apes* franchise into one of the best and simultaneously most underrated trilogies of all-time? No problem whatsoever. So when he announced that he would deliver a new take on the Caped Crusader, a superhero who has had five iterations in the last thirty three years, there was the usual scepticism. However The Dark Knight is the comic book equivalent of Shakespeare's Hamlet. A tortured protagonist who lost his father that can be adapted to new and exciting visions and *The Batman* is no exception. We have had camp Batman (Adam West), Gothic Batman (Burton), grounded Batman (Nolan) and sad Batman (Affleck). Even a Lego Batman. Finally, we get a sleuthing Batman. You know the detective Batman who appeared in Detective Comics. If *The Dark Knight* felt like the genre's take on *Heat*, with an intrinsically linked hero and villain, this is Batman via *Se7en*. The Caped Crusader forced to solve the elaborate and chilling games of The Riddler who is targeting political figures in the city. Reeves wastes no time in putting his own unique stamp on proceedings. The opening segment which establishes Gotham City and Batman's current place in it is arguably the character's strongest introduction since Keaton's in 1989. The moment he emerges from the shadows, *""Criminals think I'm hiding in the shadows... I am the shadows""*, Pattinson's Batman is anger and retribution personified. After beating a punk half to death, when he says *""I'm Vengeance!""*, he means it and you feel it. It helps when the scene is scored by Michael Giancchino, who is able to deliver a haunting and dramatic new theme for The Bat. Outside of Reeves and Pattinson, Giancchino has the trickiest job of the crew. Having to, ironically, emerge from the shadows of the likes of Danny Elfman and Hans Zimmer. To create a score and theme that is distinct from theirs, is memorable but also fits in with this new version of the story. They shoot, he scores. Not only is it tonally perfect but his theme for The Bat and The Cat is the sexiest the series has ever been. Building on the excellent chemistry between Pattinson and Kravitz. So what of Robert Pattinson? R-Patz or is that now R-Batz? The worst vampire in the world who took ten years since the last *Twilight* film to turn into a bat! The actor left behind the tentpoles to have a career on the fringes. Choosing interesting projects over paydays and becoming the poster boy for A24 in the process. Those who criticised his casting had clearly watched *Twilight* and not the like of *Good Time* and *The Lighthouse*. Given the past few films on his resume, there must have been something to Reeves's vision that lured him back"

Where previous iterations of Bruce Wayne have been reluctantly suave playboys, established in their roles as Batman (**Michael** **Keaton**) or forced into reclusiveness by the weight of responsibility, but waiting for a second wind (**Christian** **Bale**), **Robert** **Pattinson** presents Bruce as grappling with not just the weight of his mantle, but the weight of his family name. He is young enough to naively believe in inherent good, but world-weary enough to see through the lies of the establishment. Even those closest to him. This is ***Batman: Year One-***, complete with the fledgling partnership between Detective James Gordon (**Jeffery** **Wright**) and Batman, as they work together to fight the crime that floods the streets of Gotham. This is not the Batman that cinema-goers are used to-he is not as sure-footed in his humanity as previous adaptations, nor is he ready to embrace having genuine connections with anyone in his orbit-even Alfred Pennyworth (**Andy** **Serkis**), the only father figure left in his life. In a lot of ways this tortured, brooding persona makes him the most unlikeable Batman to date, but also the first Batman that feels ripe with potential to watch him grow into the mantle. This is the rich little orphan boy who dresses up like ""vengeance"" to escape from his own thoughts, rather than the man who fully sees his place in the hierarchy of the city. Pattinson's Bruce Wayne is untouchable in the gothic manor that he's fashioned into a self-imposed cage for himself, keeping himself separate from the city he so clearly longs to be part of. *The Batman* makes good on ""the world's greatest detective"" by laying out an intricate and violent mystery that forces Batman to race against time, but even with the clock working against the titular character, Reeves takes his time with the story. The film will have you on tenterhooks as the mystery unravels into jaw-dropping scene after jaw-dropping scene. It veers into the neuroses of real-life serial killers like the Zodiac Killer, while delivering ***Saw-***-esque riddles and murderous mazes. As far-fetched as some elements of the film are (this is, after all, a superhero movie) *The Batman* is perhaps the most realistic interpretation of a comic book story in recent memory. Matt Reeves has taken the most unnerving elements of social media and the immorally righteous, violence-obsessed radicals that lurk in the corners of the internet, and presented them as one of Batman's most daunting threats yet. These are not the Joker's goons who dance to upbeat tunes during bank robberies, these are radicalized villains who blindly take up arms to hunt down politicians that a maniac has branded as corrupt. Somehow Reeves manages to balance the central, driving force of the Riddler's (**Paul** **Dano**) chaos with other iconic Batman foes, including the Penguin (**Colin** **Farrell**) and Carmine Falcone (**John**"
